c. Reference c (Transalited income tax information
in response to Book Cigarette 4659). The Tax Committee
was checked regarding 12th BORK and advised they neeled
additional explanatory information on the basis of the
to being able to compute an assessment and bring his
under the revised tax procedures. TICHBORU could not
recall sufficient facts and figure: to provide the re-
quired information. lie was therefore advised 1t des to
his benefit to submit the information to the Station as
soon after the date.
(1) Other Income: He had indicated receipt of
feed but did not state whether they were the result
of work outside the U.S. or if they were received while
in, and as a result of work in the U.S. If the fees
were earned as a result of work outside the U.S.,
they are excludable for federal tax purposes.
(2) itemizel Deductions. He had indicated under
"other" $1400. but did not provide any breakdown or
explanation as to what the amount represented. It
would be to be made to the Board of Directors. The
ation to enable the Committee to recognize the amount
as an allowable item. He also indicated a loss of
$2,000 on investments. Explanatory facts are required
such as-manueen, when, reason for the lost (sale of
the loss was versus cost of $3K or whatever), whether
is better that carryvoyer from prior year(s), etc. It
than too little to such information be provided rather
TICHBORU is to provide the information in writing with
his certification as to eompleteness and accuracy for trans-
sictal to headquarter. If the information is received
within the first part of November it is likely the re-
vised procedures will be applied for the 1963 tax year.

Mr.
Dear Mr.
Tichboro
Reference is made to your current contract with the United States
Governament, as represented by the Contracting Officer.
Arrangements have been recently completed allowing certain
independent contractors of this organisation to obtain social accuritv
credits by covering such individuals under the social security tax
provisions applicable to employees. These arrangements also include
a provision for retroactive applicability to the beginning of the
1965 tax year. This can be done only for reasons of security since
the procedure results in reducing the social security tax from the
self-employed rate to the employee rate. For example, in January
of 1965 the tax rates were 5.4% and 3-5/8% respectively.
As a consequence thereof, said contract is amended by deloting
all reference to social security and by adding the following paragraph:
"Effertive 1 December 1964, social security taxes will be covertly
deducted by this-organisation from your compensation in the same
manner and to the same extent as would be done if you were a Govern-
ment employee. Security reasons make this procedure necessary. Its
implementation does not imply in any manner the actual creation of an
employee-employer relationship. Your legal status under this agree-
ment continues to be that of an independent contractor.
If you receive or expect to receive full or partial social security
credits from overt sources you will so notify this organization and an
adjustment will be made or covert deductiono discontinued, depending
upon the circumstances Further, if you should subsequently receive
overt social socurity credits, evidence thereof will be submitted to this
organisation. In such event your covert credits will be erased and your
covert deductions returned.
All other terms and conditions of salá contract remain in full force
and effect.

to him. Then, he come into Mexico for a period to get "that" novel
and writing off his chest. This is that period, he saw the
Mexican system and some of the most important systems. At that
juncture, he became very much aware of the fact that the
"system" that counted, in spite of whatever imperfections existed,
and that there "was, and is, nothing that can anywhere nearly
the most important ones. As he said, "sure, there are a lot
of things wrong, because of the most important problems who
are fallible and have their own interests to know what
there is so much good and so many compensations on the plus side
of the system and the way it works, you can afford to recognize
this wrongs and work them out within the system". He said that
the system is a problem from abroad that he just wondered why he
ever had worried about incidents and didn't realize that it
was the "system" that
b. He told about some of the discussions he had had with
leftist Mexican intellectuals oni these points such as, "Is the
Soviet system capable of producing and absorbing such pictures
of the world? He said, "I am a John Steinbeck write a 'Grapes
of wrath' and run off with all of the most interesting in- and motion
picture field? Can you even approximate that in witness
the
furore over 'The Children of Sanchez' here while the Grapes
of Wrath' was every bit as harsh with respect to similar
society. He said, "I am a friend on won everything. On and on,
so many words, our system and the world is not a man's, and
there are things to criticize, but what other system's world
is not only permissive of that, but thrives on it. And so on,
He has no doubts about any governmental/social/political/economic
system. In any combination being able to even approach it.
He's the ongoing is a wovr brief synopsis of a rambling and
long philosophy and that, on these points in which TICHBORN
concluded his statement and, in the first time, heritage
had gotten the better of him at that point) with the
that "My philosophy on this point, and my present sentiments,
have been forged in the fire of thinking as a leftist critic
of the world. It is not a very good and a great deal; and they
can't tell me a damn thing about what is the most important
the basis of their present circumstances in their own countries
have they any right or basis for criticizing the U.S. and its
actions. Nothing is perfect, and I can't defend it as being
possible. And it is not a Imperfection they try to show me in the
D.S. and what if it has or not done, I can show them hundreds
in their country and any other way. And I could up as a model."
4. In so many words, at least the Station cost officer at
the present time is satisfied in his own mind that TICHBORN was
speaking sincerely during this discussion and there is no question
in the Station's mind about where TICHBORN stands
even though he may be considered "left of center."
5. Since this issue seems to hover constantly in the back-
ground with TICHBORN laserfor as KURAN is concerned, the Station
felt it would be a good idea to refister the foregoing incluent

Loss of Personal Funds - Phand C
TROUITS
ACTION REQUIRED - RESENCIES
REFERENCE: 1815-3432, 22 April 1964
1. The delay in answering reference should not be construed no leck
of desire or intent, on the part of TICERION or the Chief of Station,
that the case be surlditted to the Cardi of Review for Sertames and Losses
for consideration, but rather as an administrative delay of getting the facts,
people, papers, etc., together and in the place for submission.
2. Attached is a statement prepared by TICEROU regarding the loss
of funds and containing the pertinent circumstances of the case. The
sub-arrarship numberings are in accordance with, and relating to, the
requirements of paragraph 3, a of R1 34-250. The information requested
in sub-arrarships numbered 8 through 12 43 as expressed jointly by Stewart
R. PARKET and Jeremy J. TALISIS who were assirated to investigate the matter
by the Board of Directors.
3. PATATER and MALSIS talked with TICEROU; at different times,
regarding the shortage of funds and the inferences as related to them
were substantially the same as outlined in TICEROUN's statement. Since
there is no other way to verify the facts and TICEROU can be proven herself
to be truthful and forthright in his dealings with the Station his
statement regarding the loss of fuxis is accepted as fact.
4. Since TICEROUN in authorized travel exercise "on actinil,
reasonable, and necessary expense basis" it does not seem sensible for
his to have reported the loss of funds in other than the key he says
actually happened.

SUBJECT
Contract Amendment Edward G. TICHBORN
ACTION REQUIRIO REJECTORS
Reference: DIB 67851
Action Required: FYI
1. Forwarded berewith is the referenced amendment
Edward G. TICHBORN's contract which provides for a one year
extension effective 19 November 1964 and a compensation
increase from $9,000 to $12,000.
2. During Subject's recent TDY in Washington it was
made clear to him that this substantial pay raise and extension
of his contract was on the basis that TICHBORN continue to
devote 85 to 90% of his time to KUBARK activity. In view of
the fact that Subject is currently handling only one intellectual
property. The proposed agreement was to be made to the extent
that his work load reverts to the 50 to 65% level, he cannot
expect to continue to receive the present amount of compensation.
During Subject's talks at Hoadquarters, it appeared that
the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of
he is reaffidered on the basis of services rendered, In return
for this arrangement, the government makes no claim on income
he might receive from his private business activities. Obviously
it is our hope that coupled with the occasional full-time
assignments in other WH countries levied on TICHBORN, that the
Station will be able to continue to utilize Subject's services
at the high level of activity which will justify his current
compensation.

General - Administrative
Specific - Cover Income Tax Return to Edward G. TICBOARD
ACTION HOUND: DEFERENCE
REFERENCE: BDS-3952, dated 15 January 1965
1. Refranced dispatch has caused TICHBORN and the Station to become aware
of some own problems with the Maxican banking system. As Headquarters may
not be aware, TICBORN has a dollar account with a Mexico City bank for his
personal affairs. Insurance, insurance, insurance, insurance, insurance, insurance
depository, and insurance insurance. TICHBORN requested his bank to
depository, but only provide atatemente. TICHBORN requested his bank to
provide him with his cancelled check (on a loan basis) so that copies could
be made of it. It developed over a process of several weeks that the bank
could be made of it. It would not had it been run through TICHBORN's account,
Sliace ample time had expired. The bank is held in June 1964), the bank checked
all accounts of persons with TICHBORN's account name on the theory that it
might have been run through cosmome else's account (not an unusual occurrence
here). If had not that the bank could discogred.
2. As a result, TICHBORN is stopping payment on the check with the bank,
writing the office with which he filed his overt income tax, advising that
office of the circumstances, and requesting some word back whether or not,
the check was made to the bank and the check. If the check was
received, TICHBORN will provide the State of the City and the City's
stating and remove the "stop payment" order on the check. If the check was
not received (mail is another problem), then TICHBORN will send another check
and a copy of the interchange of correspondence on the matter with the bank
and the Income tax authorities will be provided Headquarters. It is hoped
this will be satisfactory.
3. The only reason the Station is providing all the grouscoma details on the
foregoing to so that Headquarters will have some understanding of the Mexican
banking problems should questions of this nature arise again.

Dear F..Thomee:
Due to increased demands unon my time from other clients,
I find it necessary to relinquish my duties as legal counsel
for the IILR here in Mexico, and I do so with great reluctance.
One of my heretofore-leaser clients has recently expended his
activities in certain resl estte developments in Gundalajara
and Puerto Vallarta, thereby necessitating 4 frequent absence
from Mexico City. Then, too, I had underestimated the amount
of tine and effort required to satisfactorily attend the verious
legal and administrative matters confronting CEDS. Should you
so desire, I could recommend other legal counsel; but I am
inclined to feel that the Centro's principal problems would be
of an administrative nature rather then a legal one.
As for my legal fees to date, I am submitting a bill for
$650.00 U.S. C.7. This represents a total of 65 hours at the
rate of $10.00 per hour. By regular fees count to $20.00 per
hour, but, in keeping with my own political affinity for labor
courses, I have reduced them to the lesser figure.
My I thank you again for your confidence and good will in
having chosen me as legal counsel for your org-nization's activities
in Mexico. I shall be happy to give you a personal report of my
observations on my next trip to New York.
Sincerely yours,
Henry P. Lopez

DISPATCH
TO
Chief, WHD
INPO.
Chief, KUNOLF
FROM
Chief of Station, Mexico City
SUNET
General - LICOLIC
Ospecific - Edward G. TICHBORN Cover and Working Papers.
ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
REFERENCE: HMDA-24456 dated 3 Oct 64.
-As Headquarters is aware, Edward G. TICHBORN is in Mexico on'a tourist
visa and with a number of "associations" (i.e., law firm PAPPIE, TV
and movie contacts in Mexico) which have sufficed to provide satisfactory
information about the same phase presence and activities here up to this time.
However, he has been the most important issue of the "safety" of the
Latin American countries where a continuation of this curcist status and
present cover arrangements should be changed for something more substantial.
All of this became apparent when he began to try to obtain his working
process, and the "safety" of the "safety" of the "safety" of the "safety"
cannot-practice-this-profession in-Mexico.under-Mexican-law. Therefore,
to find a peg for working paper approval, something else had to be found.
None of his numerous present cover associations or stories had enough substance
to provide a sufficiently plausible basis for working papers. The corporation
was a "safety" of the "safety" of the "safety" of the "safety" of the "safety"
(e.g., fairly affluent PPBIRIN interested in culture and intellectuals
trying to-get something of the. -nature started and then, interest
PBRIME foundations in picking it up) will not support an application for
working papers. As a result, the Station and TICHBORN were casting about
for something else with more depth and durability.

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH
SECRET
HPCMA-24457
2. During the week of 27 September, an old friend of TICHBORN's, Identity A,
came up with the following proposition:
a. Identity A-own Identity B which operates out of: Mexico City and distri-
butes PBFRIME shows dubbed into Spanish throughout the Caribbean and
in the United States. The business has been in existence for some time and,
according to TICHBORN's this thriving. Identity A said that his business had
reached a point where he needed legal assistance of various types, but was
not prepared to turn it over to just any local loney since it involved
a wide range of problems.
b. Identity A, who knew from conversations with TICHBORN that the latter
was thinking about getting Mexican working papers, made an offer-to TICHBORN:
He said that he would provide TICHBORN with office space and telephone in
the United States. The American Mexico City on Reforma if TICHBORN
would just advise him on what 1990. The United States, to these various legal
problems and act as a very general legal advisor to their own.
these people. He and TICHBORN figured this would take, perhaps, 5% of the
latter's time. Further, and most important; Identity A said he would provide
the basis with Identity B for TICHBORN obtaining his working papers. For
victuous reasons, however, Identity A desired an answer right away (within
1990).
3. The Station checked out Identity A in Station files and found that there
had been some previous traffic on him in the period, 1957-61; NCC-W-334
dated 19 December 1957; HOMA-A-9454 dated 12 February 1958; DIR-40866 dated
20 May 1961; DIR-41304 dated 22 May 1961; DIR-1303 dated 23 May 1961. As will be
DIR- 41208 dated 23 May 1961; and MEXI-8085 dated 23 May 1961. As will be
preserved in the United States, he was a member of the 1990-1991, which in
empticed as legal counsel to Identity A. (This never really has been in
although TICHBORN used an association with Identity A, which was never more
than close social contact and an interest in show business, as one of his
opinions, the United States in all this traffic, there was not any derogatory
information developed on the United States. The United States, and the
of the beginning required and this previous traffic told TICHBORN to "so an
with the arrangement since it is not only essential for his local activities,
but will provide him with stronger and readily-available cover for any
further Latin American trips (i.e., FUSSIER) he might be required to make.
TICHBORN has been told, to transact an absolute minimum of his business for
KUBARK at this office on his regular projects. (e.g., ROMINE and (RiAMATLE).
4. Hopefully, this will also straighten out the working papers problem on some
sort of rational basis in the near future.

1. As probably can be discerned from previous communications on this subject,
the Station has never been too certain about the original understandings with
Subject on his relationship with KUBARK. At least some understandings have been
supplementary to the formal contract (such as, this availability for extended-
trips to Latin American areas in election periods). This is no complaint on
the part of the Station, but merely a prelude to a matter which the Station
brought up with TICHBORN in connection with his intellectual magarine and
the Station.
2. It has been the Station's inference, from talking to TICHBORN as well as
comunications on other aspects of his relationship with KUBARK not covered
in his contract, that he is not to be considered a full-time contract agent.
In other words, he has outaide activities, in the legal and other fields-hare
which it was understood would provide additional income to him at the time he
has been the first time of the relationship with KUBARK. As can be discerned from
his biographic data, he has reported at A level and enjoyed an income outlook
that would not be satisfied by the contract and recrual arrangements on salary.
It has become obvious to the Station, however, that he has done, properly
present requirements being imposed on him by the Station, and we, help, be

CONTINUATION OF
HOUU-24353
DISPATCH
SECRET
3. Taking all the foregoing into consideration and to avoid complications with
his present projects up TICIBORN, the Station asked him what understanding he
had so the proportion of his time to be devoted to KUBARK activities, lie said
that his present contract was predicated on approximately 60 to 66-2/3% of
his time being utilized by KUBARK. His present estimate is that he is devoting
85 to 90% of his time to KUBARK activities; and, if he is to do the kind of job
that is desired on the two intellectual projects recently acquired, he will
be the same as the KUBARK. Of course, he continues to be available for appropriate
election of political assets (such as FUSPEN) in other countries from time
to time; but, it has to be recorded and that when he is absent from basic,
this represents 100% of his time.
4. The Station agrees with his analysis on current commitments against his
timn on behalf of KUBARK. Therefore, it was indicated to TICIBORN that he
should be prepared to take up this matter with Headquarters at the time he
makes his late October trip to PERRINE in connection with the new intellectual
magazine (see reference) and that the Station would request Headquarters to be
prepared to dedicuss the state of the State of Virginia. Section's understanding
of the State's contract extension expires 19 November 1986.
5. The Station would like to emphasize that this matter was brought up at its
initiative in order to try (n) to assure that demands being placed on TICIBORN
recently could be reasonably expected to be fulfilled and (b) to get a complete
understanding on all aspects of TICIBORN's contractual status fritten and
unwritten) so that neither the Station nor TICIBORN get committed to these
continuing activities and suddenly find themselves in contention about the
time/salary-involed it. should also be emphasized that TICIBORN has not
complained about recent requirements but has devoted whatever time required
to handle them and do the job expected.

Tichborn Report on Caracas Travel
ACTION REPORTS
Reference: IDWV-11415, 22 March 1963 5:13
1. Station Review regrets that, to date, it has been unable
to obtain the Reference Report from Tichborn. As headquarters is aware,
Tichborn, while brilliant and articulate, is not always dependable,
especially when it comes to routine tasks. It is true, however, that
Tichborn has been extremely busy traveling for KUBARK, and is at the moment
on another of his frequent trips.
2. In any event, Tichborn has promised to provide the report as
soon as he returns from his present trip. It will be forwarded when received
from him.
RECLASSIFIED.

Paul O:
Tichborns original contract provided for travel on an actual
expense basis. This was when he was working on a daily or job
rate basis.
This contract was terminated and a new contract was written
in May 1961. He was given as $8,000 per year, and the reimbursement
for operational travel section reads "This may include per diem in
lieu of subsistence-
None of Tichborn's travel claims have been processed since the
new contract has been effective. All travel claims submitted by
him. starting in June 1961 have been submitted on an actual expense
Finance takes the view that the "This may include per diem-
as restricting Tichborn to per diem only plus of course operational
expenses. Processing Tichborns old accounts on this basis would
require him to refund several hundred dollars.
An amendment to the contract would take care of these old
accounts as submitted.
Options:
1. Get refund from Tichborn
2. Amend contract to cover actual expenses to present
date.
3. Amend contract to cover actual expenses past and
future.
What are your wishes?

that he was, cf course, assure that there are other fertility needs for
TICHECRR's services.
2. While the Station would velcome another visit by subject, it does
not appear that the need for a general survey is so pressing as it was a
year ago. It is doubted that basic conditions have changed greatly, and
the fact that the fact that the fact that the family well covered in CDETD

it should be noted that there are no other parties to date in the field
except the goverment party, the Fartido Cencilacion Nacional (FCF), and

6 August 1962
The following information was derived from a transcrip-
tion of a tape made during a meeting with Edward TICHBORN
in early June 1962. In Washington, D.C. The purpose of the
meeting was to debrief TICHBORN concerning his opinions and
experiences gained from a recent trip to El Salvador. TICHBORN
spoke from notes for the first part of his report (pp 1-6)
and answered specific questions for the remainder.

-2-
the less wathy people in E1 Salvador have looked askanco
at the Alliance for Proress. I think you will remember that
in my last report I predicted that we would have problems
with respect to many reforms if they were to be the sine qua
non of aid from the United States.
With respect to the Church, I think it might be a good
idea to give some very detailed study and to how we can exploit
to the best: possible extent, the apparent change within the
Church not only in E1 Salvador over Latin America. I
think that it is not a finding that we should sit around or
soon goes around for a considerable time trying to analyze
a little time and for a good way.
The use of action in Latin America.
Now you ask me in our informal charts about the structure
of these as far as the nationalities of the people involved in
the hichrarchy. I think it's in the other structure, Spaniards
and Itallian, and I think it's the structures most of the people
to be a very useful and some from Guatemala and that their
natural inclination would be to go with the people. I think
I mentioned in my carlier report that we have to be a
protests in their early business. We 100, 6:00 or 7:00 a.m.
We 100, 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. in the city by the low-income groups) would
ask for social changes and reforms. At the later Vasses, they
would change the attitudes of their sermons because of the
different economic complex of the people attending church.
It's interesting to note that the Bishop's letter that was
issued with respect to reforms got a very entry reaction from
the 16th.
New one of the things that 1 note with respect to the
general political nicosophero in San Salvador is that there
seems to be a considerable confusion among the people with
respect to some of these reforms. Let's note that
the minimum salary. We 100, 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. in the
U.S. Congress. Junch. JUNTA, and it will be carried through by
President-elect RIVERA. As of right now, there seems to be a
very calculated Campaign on the part of business and on the
part of financiers to confuse the people, and the
a good job of the industry. We 100, 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. in
the city, didly, "that is this mindm salary all about?" Many
of them tolc me the government has decided that they can be paid to
only se much and no more. In other words, they have roally con-
verted it into an idea that this is maximun'snary. Also there
hos been a considerable loying off of all people in certain


-3-
factories and the reason being given, that the government now
takes it depression for us to keep a full staff, and therefore
we are reducing. This, of course, could have very serious
effects on any ability to make it very through its
reforms with respect to mininur wage. Interests are
there are even people in the lower classes, who having been
confused by what it means, are very definitely agninst the
whole idea of minimum wage. I think, here again, it is a
vantage of the 100% of the 100% of the entire a newspaper or
to buy a considerable interest in one of the 100% of the
a job of publicizing and getting the message across with
respect to the general class of laborers. However, I anticipate
the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of
are in a good positive- that the people, with the economic power,
particular reform by the simple expedient of just laying people
off and blaming it on the government. Let's face it, with
respect to political reform in Latin Anoricn, the thing that
is the most important role in political liberty, but
"bread in the belly." We have got to be a good thing and
that when we, with our own criteria of political liberties here
in the United States, go into Latin America we have got to
be a good thing that is a right to vote and the right to express
our views is a meaningless way. We have to be a good thing
worried about whether he gets one tortilin or two tortilias;
it's the bread that is the biggest political factor in any part
that in America. In this respect, it is interesting to note
that we have to be a good thing that is the right to vote and
lot of talk about Fidel Castro that was just kind of spontaneous
and exemporancous on the part of some several hundred people
that I talked to. This time I also won't through many of the
opinions of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of
number of people, and a given effort to the continuing
Martinez who was the president for about 10 to 12 years, a
1934 to 45, Many of them, particularly, the older people
were more socially about the times of Martinez when
thoug the wages were low, you could buy a full of the good
get comparatively contortable housing. Of course, it is
known that Martinez is one of the worst tyrants that they have
been more likely. But long time the thin they remember is not
the regressive because that he took, not the number of people
that were slaughtered under his orders. The thing that is
remembered now mostly to the other there were more jobs,
that the prices were low, etc. We've got to constantly hear


-4-
in mind that the things that are mostly meaningful the these
groups of people is whether the "moral" of the
factors of people are "moral" than their "moral" needs that are
met by any government. I want to talk now for a moment about
the Alianza para Pregresso and some of my impressions about
how it's doing, not only in 11 Salvador, but in Guatemala and
soce of the other countries that i observed. One of the most
immediate im.ressions that 1 get is during the last few months
of the 19th century. It is the most important factor in the
publicized. I think we made a serious mistake in arousing
expectations in Latin America that may not be net. As a
matter of fact, I know (rom talking with many of the people
there are no other things that they are not the most important
factor than the of what the United States has planned. I oven
think it's unfortunate if we have a slogan, that the Alianza
para Progresso as a slogan is open to serious attacks both
humorously and satirically. As a matter of fact, already
the most important factor is that they are not the American
by way of criticism. I have in mine recently, that the foreign
minister of Honduras was in Mexico and in a public statement
said, "we have a lot of alliance but no progress." And of
course in the schools in 11 Salvador, there are all kinds of
turnings about twisting the words around by way of criticism.
What I mean by over publicizing and sloganizing is the
fact that almost all over Latin America, the newspaper
is the most important factor in the world. The world is
and as you might expect they convert the figures into pesos,
or other local currency whatever you happen to be, so that
there is an announcement saying that the Alianza para Progresso
has been the most important factor. It is the most important
factor 120 million pesos; it sounds like an awful lot of money.
Immediately people have grandioso idens about what is going
to be done with all this money when in effect it is only a
request for that kind of money that has been done. He have,
not only the same thing that is the most important factor. It
how much money is going to be allocated. Let me give you a
specific case about what I feel is an overt publicizing of
the Alliance's program. In 11 Salvador there was an announce-
ment of the United States Government. The United States
coated by the United States Government for the building of
schools. Now, 3 million dollars converted into local currency
is something like seven and half million colonies. That's a
big sum of money down there and, of course, it got tremendous
than the world. It is the most important factor. It is the most
Alliance had in mind, along with the Junta, was to build one
hundred seall schools. This would be 100 schools worth
around $30,000 a piece. Well, one of the model schools, right
now, is in the process of constructions in ence of the neigh-
berhoods in 11 Salvador. While I was there, there was


-5-
considerable snide criticism by the press; by a let of the
population that this was a poor example of Alliance fer
Progress spending. It was a small school; it was within the
school's school, get, but I am thinking that most of the
people in 11 Sallyad, and 1000 colleges, and 1000 colleges, were
were expecting palaces to be built. Suddenly you have a very
small school, and it was being criticized by the press; by the
people at large. The next day, quite fortunately, the Minister
was a very good example of the unaided convicted it by
saying: "We said we are going to build school, and I have faces,"
But I think that even this criticism could have been avoided
had we announced rather that the expenditure of 3 million:
"Everyone or 7,500,000 colonies, had we just-announces that the
Alliance's school, and 1000 colleges, and 1000 colleges, were
government, was going to build 100 small schools and say so
without any more dressing it up, not even mention the amount
of money that was going to be spent in total because then no
work was done. The second small school. Also I think it
would have been better to have a more difficult time. The
Salvador, possibly in a little town like Santa Techin or one
of the other neighboring towns; and then build the school
right next to the old school so that there would be a marked
beneing of the school. The school was a very close, Certainly
there is always land available near all the old school.
just destroy the old school when you've built the new one; and
then really to do a public relations job, get statements from-
ing to the school, and students, and, perhaps, have the cldest
school teacher in the school. The school is a very good way to
school. Really do a public relations job of it on a very
personal basis rather than trying to stnger people with huge
sums of money. This is what I mean by talking in huge figures
that the school's activities job and arouse less expectation. When
you have few expectations, almost anything is better; so 1
think if we talk litting about a bit, we're going to be such
better off in the long run.
1 think also a very highly over-publicized grow is the
Peace Corrs. Here again, I think we're setting ourselves up
for some possible difficulty. All of this publicizing is
very good for consumption here in the United States; but in
the world, we are going to be able to grow kind of propaganda
gets outside the United States, All of the three are all kinds
of jokes about the Peace Corps. Its done a terrific job of
publicizing here in this country. They set great coverage in


-6-
all the big picture magazines. In time there's going to be
a musical comedy about the Peace Corps. All this is great
stuff as far as the United States is concerned, but I'm
afraid it is going to create serious problems abroad. Actually
the actual observable benefit of the Peace Corps in the
American War, the American, or financial when you consider, for
example, they have about 7 years. The role that will be in the Peace
Corp. in San Salvador. They're going to be a new look for the sake
much of a dent in separate communities, because they are
separated. As I understand it, from talking to the manager
of the American War, the central American area; most of
these kids will be alone in the American. There are going to,
and whatever they do is not going to be very obsolete. The
far as the general population is concerned. Unfortunately,
the American things that we haven't yet learned in our thinking
about these things. This is more policies is the fact that we do
such naive things as this: therefore, we can't think about 63
years of age that has been assigned to one of the small
villages in southern El Salvador and her expertise is home
and is not a very popular person between to one of these small
villages and if you have ever been working on the way
subsist, merely on a small supply of beans and maybe one or
two tortillas; and the difference between the supply of one
of the American Americans, meaningful one. When you start
talking about balancing the prices, they can then the diet and
having a home economics expert to teach them to be the
pretty ironic. This is precisely the thing that could
easily be open to criticism and easily open to satire. I can
be able to get a more important position of Dr. Jose Rodriguez
RUIZ, who was a very left lead to a more important position
Economics in El Salvador--if I really wanted to cede on one
issue and ridicule it, I would talk about this person who was
not a little chance economics; balanced dieting; and how many
vegetables you have been; what variety of vegetables, how
much cottage cheese you should have; and the whole thing in the
balanced diet. I could subsequently, while thing in very short
time and make it very ridiculous.
I think these are things that. we've got to think about.
We've got to think about all the possible weaknesses, how this
thing can be turned around. I know that in the United States,
the American American town of this woman (she's (from Nebraska)
it sounds absolutely morally nervous and this home economics expert
is going down to a little. Latin American country and tell them
all about home economics, but from the point of view of the
Latin American it's sheer from and it's susceptible to attack.


with respect to your nuction about the influence
of the Church with the cemestines in other parts of the
consumity: I think that it's probably true all over
Latin America that the Church has great influence on the
thinking of the population. It's interesting to note
that in San Salvador and Mexico the real church geers
are the most important factors. The idea of the certain
that their wives go to church so that they're thoir
surrogates and that they take their children along with
them. Although they are not great church geers, I think
they are Catholics and are greatly influenced by the priests.
You asked whether the people in E1 Salvador are
aware that there have been food shortages in Cuba and that
the Castro proprae is undergoing serious difficulties and
the fact that the church is not a way of understanding
interested in this when 1 talked to various people, including
cab drivers and boys that shine your shoes, people working
in the markets, and some of the camezinos. There is an
insightful and an important role in the church's health
difficultios. One of the things that is interesting and,
of course, I think this may be referable to their Church
influence, is that the word Communism per so still has a
society for the purpose of the development of the things
they talk about--social reform, etc., etc., but, the
Communism is still a very harsh tag in the Latin American
mind. I think this is one of the serious errors Castre
and the world's view was to declare himself a
Communist and pilarist who is the only one of the that
might have gone along with his at that moment got frightened
off. There is an awareness that he is having troubles and
that the Revolution hasn't gene along on the way it has.
The idea of the world is to be a very good thing
people that I talked with--these were some workers from a
textile mill, that there had been an awful lot of killing
that was done by Castro. Apparently, there had been
pictures of a lot of executions in some of the Latin American
newspapers; and this has had an effect on them.
With respect to the government prosecuting anyone for
violations, the government's government will understand,
it's still in its infancy. I think the belief of the
government is that if they. start to impose any violations
this might have a serious effect in getting the program
across. But in this respect, I'd like to mention the
soventh day wage that was passed about a year ago when I


was in Selyader apparently is working fairly well. you'll
recall that this was accepting with the while that if
anyone worked for six days (this was referable to the
compesines) the was entitled to the seventh day pay. I was
worried at the time and mentioned my worries to Choretic
(Phonetic) and also the Minister of Economics who was at
breakfast with us at that time, that one of the possible
information about the number of people in the country
intelligently and forcibly. It is better not to have a
reform, not to announce a now idea, not to arouse expecta-
tions, if there is going to be violation of those
expectations. At that time it was contemplated that the
concern of the problem of the problem of the problem of
Apparently they have changed their mind on that and have a
civilian group that is administering the program; there
has been nc real scandal with respect to violations of
the problem of the little fearful that a local army quv would
get paid off by some of the big plantation owners and thus
be permitted to do all kinds of violations. Apparently
this has not happened, and they've been pretty effective
in the administration.
My big objection at that time was that again the
minimum salary thing was not properly publicized. They
could have had all kinds of rudic and television programs,
and they are not going to be in the same way. The
felt about this end actually doing that kind of public
relations job which they did not do. I think this is true
with all these roforns. I think that they have got to be
brought to the people where you got rosection from the
people as to the extent of the change, any reform has on their
personal existence. This again is a matter of attitude,
a mortality of the problem.
Well, it is certainly true that these has been a
considerable amount of publicity about the Allanza pará
Progresso. I was not aware that it was this specific group
that was pushing the program of publication. However,
the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem is
a serious possibility that over publicizing of the Alianza
will cause more trouble than we can at present anticipate.
As a matter of fact some of the problems are already
beginning to arise. I had a long talk with Ambassador
dillians on this, and I think we both aLrced that we ought
to soft real reach of the talk about the Alianza; and
the majority of why from these enormous figures of
billions of dollars. As far as the people in Latin America


- 9 -
are concerned they really think the world is going to
change overnight and expect it to change overnight. When
the changes aren't forthcoming, they are going to be very
ambitterod and we may possibly create enenies we need not
have, had.
I have in mind talking with one man; he was a
newspaper vendor and I happened to see a headline about
the Alianza para Prozrosso, and this of course gave no an
opening to talk to him about it. I said, "What is this
possible? I have to see that you are going to do with
going to give me a new house, Soreeno standing close to
his said, "what do you mean--they're going to give you a
house," and they actually had an ajucent about the thing.
The man selling the newspapers insisting that's what they
have. And I have to see that you are going to do with
man saying that's all propaganda, it's all demagogy; they
say this all the time and nothing is going to occur. The
chances are very strong that this man will not get into
the same way. And I have to see that you are going to
won't even get an apartment because you cannot possibly
meet the housing shortage in such a place in San Salvador,
where I doubt more than 10% of the people have adequate
hygienic dwellings. So here again, well at least, this
is a very good thing. And I have to see that you are
notion about what we're going to do. It way be that in his
particular case, he is nere aware of the Allanza and more
nurse of the million dollars because he is selling news-
papers and magazines and he is reading about it all the
time. Here again I think is one of the dangers with
respective people, and I have to see that you are going
to do.
I think I mentioned in my report about a year ago. it
might be a good idea to get some experts in public relations,
and that they might be recruited from such places as Noxice
and Puerto Rico where you have people who have worked with
either government agencies, with some of our embassies, or
the other government agencies, and the other government
Rubicam & Noble Advertising and other very widely-known
public relations groups in Latin America. I think it
might be a good iden for the government to have someone
counseling him and particularly on any wide shifts of policy
and policy. And I have to see that you are going to do with
an enormously effective way in presenting the programs of
the government, and it would be a good (avestment they could
make at this point. And I don't just mean getting the


- 10 -
ordinary Maldsen Avenue fick. : think it ought to be a
person who has had some experience dealing with the Lutin
American terperament because any program has to arise out
of the psyche of the perio that are boing dealt with.
Incidentally, I did see some of the pictures and some
of the coverage that was given Rivera during his election
companin and whoever handled that, I think, was very
effective; and I've suggested to the Ambassador that he
might suggest that the same people or person he retained
to act in the same way. The same person is the same
I think one of the key persons with respect to the
left in El Galvnder is the bean of the School of Economics
whose name is Jose Rodríguez Puiz. He is also the son of
the president of the University. Now first a word about
the young son--he gave a lecture on Marxise one of the nights
I was there, and I went to the lecture. Then I'm the
cigarette, and I'm the most important thing to the
dooways, and I would estimate thore wcre 400 or 500 people
thore. It was a rather interesting experience because
from what I heard I had been led to believe that it would
be a very good thing that I would have to be a great gate
to people into action. Actually what I saw was-personally
It was very moving, really: He has kind of the manner of
a priest. His voice tends to tremble at first; but as he
got more involved, he lost the tremor in his voice and
the same way. He is the most important thing to
thinking was when he spoke about the United States, it was
more in symbolic toras; there was nothing of real harsh
personal rancer either in his voice, his manner, or in what
to be the most important thing to the other. He also
referring to an abstraction of the United States. He
didn't take off on the Ambassador personally. lie just talked
about American ambassadors and he was bitter, less inclined
to be sarcastic than morally. He is the most important
thing that the man who is not there, he moved the audience
that he had, emotionally. I could see one of them kind
of swallowing and the tears running down eyes of the girl
to the left of use. There was really no attempt to rabble
the man who is not the other. He was very good but it
the streets as it were. Toward the end he made a very
interesting statement--he said: "We know that there are
changes necessary, we know that we have got to free ourselves
of the imperialist yole of the United States, and we know
that these changes have got to come through us; no one is
going to hel: us but ourselves," but he says in making those


- 11 -
changes come about, let us be contrul that we do not ruin
and that we do not set back our program by taking
:reci:itous action, without plan. Suidenly, it come almost
as a jarring note, he said--well perhaps we' re not ready
to act yet, but whatever we do, we've got to do it
reasonably so that we don't lose the revolution as such.
I don't know whether he had eicrence to the fact that
maybe in Cuba the revolution did not work because certainly
he was very pro Castro. I think that there were a kind of
note on the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of
I suggested to the ambassador that it might be a good
idea for his to set up a meeting with Guillermo Moscoso
with the older Jose Napoleon Rodríguez Ruiz who was the
(rector) of the University, and possibly ask this younger
fellow, the Dean of the School of Economics to come along
with the other. The idea of the idea of the idea of the idea
probably disagree with a lot that we're doing and you are
very skeptical about the Allanza para Progrosso; you' ro
very skoptical about the United States per se. Maybe in
many senes you're right, maybe in the post you had reason
to be the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of
indicate to you that we have a change of attitude and just
give us a chance and I need your counsel and you' ro an
economist and I want to know. I realize that we may disagree,
that we have a change of the idea of the idea of the idea of
a possibility that a person in his fraco of mind and I say
this is only a possibility and it may be very minimal as
a possibility; but there is a chance that we any be able to
recreate some kind of tio with his so that he has been
referred to as a "society" that he is not a last from
hearing that lecture, that evening that he is entirely
bowond the pale; and bear in mind that there wero no
Americans, there was no one in the audience (that I could
detect at least) who were not from El Salvador itself. I
realize that we have a change of the idea of the issue of
this; but did suggest it to the ambassador, but thought
it is right to a good idea and he may very well do this.
Apparently the father, Jose Rodriguez Ruiz, Sr.
(Noroleon), is a person who is approachable. No is not as
far to the left as his son. He is a liberal, but he is
not considered a Communist. There is, I understand, some-
of the facts, and that it is not a common thing that is
checked out and it is felt that he is not a Communist. In
any event, thore has been an invitation extended to him to
come to the United States. I think, as a matter of fact,
that with many of these people that if they were to come to


-12 -
the United States and given some kind of chance to
observe the United States first hand, they would be less
bitter about us. I think that they have adopted some very
dopatic notions about us; they believe sone of what they
see in the povies; kinds of snatches of newsreels about
the situation in the South. Actually, they have a very
little sense of what they have. And, in the past, they
distorted notion. They really believe some of the things
they've heard. I think if they would see us first hand
they might feel differently: Just as I think sometimes
when a let of these feelings are the same. And, in the
case of the question, that it isn't what they have been told
it is. I know that I've. called to some people in Mexico
who have seen Cuba first hand during the Inst year and have
had noticeable changes of mind as to what it is. It's one
thing to the other. And, in the past, we have to see
that nothing, but it's another thing when you actually go
there. and observe some of the tyrannical atmosphere. I think
the saae thing is. truo on the reverse that you can disenchant
people by sending them to Pussia or to Cuba or behind the Iron
Tobacco Institute. The first thing is the first thing. The
misprecessions, erroneous impressions by sending people to
the United States and having them live on a canprus for
example, such as Casbridge, Michigan, or any such place where
they can see first hand that we're not the oppressors that
they have been led to believe for a long time. Much of this
is required.
During the time that I was in E1 Salvador about 10 days
ago, there arose a serious problem of the departation of
Salvadoranians from Honduras; and it was all ovur the news-
papers, and very strong statements were issued both in the
editorials and by people over the radio about chasins out
some of the Salvadoranians that had been working in Honduras
for a long time. Apparently there has been a repreachment;
there were two people who have the Foreign ministers and I
think that problem may be.
It's interesting to note that E1 Salvador is the most
heavily repoliated country of Central America. I think they
have a population of about 120 per square mille, whereas
Honduras and Nicaragun have something like 15 or 17 per square
mile. Therefore, you have to be the most important.
The most important factor in San Salvador. The other thing
is traditionally the people of San Salvador are supposed
to be the hardest workers in Central America. I remember
that Antonio Bivora, a very well-known attorney in San
Salvador, said that the Salvadorans were referred to as the


- 13 -
Japanese of Central America because they're the tough
xofkers. Also there is a considerable amount of Sivalodor-
anian capital that is in various industries throughout
Central America which is an interesting thing to me. The
comparison to the Japanese seems to be very appropriate
in this situation.
The "tobacco" is the real focus of trouble, if there is
going to be any. would be either the Labor unions or I
think more particularly in the University, My feelings
about Central America, generally, is that your revolutions
do not come from the capesinos or they do not even come
from the lower classes. They generally are the middle-
of the American. They are more than 20 years. I think in
liowana, for example, Batista was overthrowing the
compesinos but by the middle classes; and then the
compesinos can in afterwards because there was very little
doing outside of Havana even in the Sierra Maders, there
is a very little way of the American. The American state
really tell is when he had so dam much trouble inside of
Havana. He fled and left because he was having problems of
sabotage in liawana itself and not because Castro was
seriously threatening him from the Sierra Wadres, for he
had actually withdrawn about a month both before, if you recall.
The American Society, he said, "I just got a State Domingo,
here again Union Civica Nacional was made up to the
lectuais and by the middle classes and not by the campesinos.
As a matter of fact, Trujillo has tremendous support and
adulation among many of the capesinos and his real basic
and scientificism with was from the low economic groups. As a
matter of fact, the American Society, he said, "I
lower barrios where he had the toughest little juvenile
delinquents you could ingine as a Secret Police, and this
was a real force. The interesting thing is that right
after Trujillo died, the first big mass meeting that his
son' had was in the poorest barrio in Santo Domingo because
he knew that the American Society was a strength.
I think the same thing is true in San Francisco.
don't think it will be the campesinos. that will give you
the trouble; it will be the students. With respect to the
student situation, I think they might borrow leaf from PRI's
book in dealing with the students. I think the goverziment
of the American Society, he said, "I have fora a liaison
with the universities and whenever the American Society pupils
to give them a job in the government, to bring them into
the various positions within the government and the same
thing with professors, to have them as economic advisors


- 14 -
whether they and they're huzan being--one, they'11
be littered and other thing, they' 11 need the money.
I think one of the things that might be helpful with respect
to the situation in the universities is to try and catch
some of these students in the past. I said, I suggested
to the ambassador, a plan that would be seen in comparable
to the Rotary Club's scholarship; that are given in
Colorado, I remember that when I was going through high
school, I have been working by the Rotary Club and I
was given a sponsor. I used to make a new program to
we'd have lunch. I reesober this very strongly because it
was meaningful to me to have this kind of relationship.
I have been working for the businessmen in San Salvador could
get the bright young people. I have been working
actually the guys who beccame the effective leaders in the
college. Get them on the high school level and become
friends with them. Once they have gotten to know some of
the most important people who be the ogress that they later
talk about, and have had some of them. I have been
them; they are more apt to be approachable. At least the
person who has been their sponsor during the time in high
school, I have been much then. I think we have got to start
working on this school. We have been very seriously
your long time. We have been working on this school.
Your leaders can be spotted, the people who are going to
be your most effective in colleges can be spotted in the
high schools. I think that is the time to start bringing
them to the college. I have been a direct with the government, also
the business community. I talk about the college. I
this and he said he felt it was a good idea and was going to
talk to some of the people about it. I think, bearing
the role of the college. I have been over seats in
many of the Latin American countries. We have been
to accept this as a starting point and then work with this
and find out what are the elements that produce the
high school. We have been the orders first become observable
and try to catch them at the same time. We have been
think it would ameliorate much of the situation with
respect to tho students. The other thing (still on the
university thing) I've observed in places that I have
been the most important to those universities really
are not newspapers. I think the students are not
really truly ineffective as far as appealing to the middle
span. The same thing with the rightist, you have either
the same thing that. The Catholics, generally speaking,
have newspapers that are not always the very rare very
dogmatic to the right. Then you have the fullt students
who have poorly printed or poorly maieegraphe of newspaper
to the left. I suspect that the vast number of people
who are in the middle never have any newspapers and here,
-


15 -
I think, is a fertile f:ed for us tox:z: the
act. I saw a newspaper in 11 Salvador called the Daily
News; it's an American newspaper. I don't know who is
the editor of it, but it is really truly a newspaper and
the other. And the other is the most ill is a nowsy
periodical and I think it could be said. The one of the
many of the neesjapors in some of these Central American
universities. In :mexico I think you would have to have
a printed newspaper because there are nere resources,
which are not the most high-ineographed newspapers if
they are made into newsy papers. The article is to be
that you have actual news, gossip columns in these
newspapers about who is going with whom and all that sort
of stuff, have student programs, have actual news about
the news, and the news, and the news, and the news
news and nouth only one-third editorial. Once you get
people in as readers then they will read some of your
editorial comment. Also it can become the organ to the
journal of the news, and the news, and the news, and
universities I have ever seen have a news. It is not
spcaks for them. I think, for example, and I mentioned
this tc Dave Phillips and Bill Carlson in Mexico, that
the news is the most active student newspaper at the
University of Mexico, and the news is the news, and
83,000 students and this is the growing middle class,
these are the spokesmen. They don't have a newspaper,
and I think it might be a good idea, for example, to
be a very good idea, for example, to be a very good
invite prospective editors of. student newspapers to
study the tech: lages of typography; to study the techniques
of what makes a newspaper readable. Actually La quincena
and the news, and the news, and the news is obviously
a political tract. There isn't one single thing that
appears that doesn't have a political pitch, a very
strong anti-leftist pitch. Frankly, it is a boring
newspaper and typographically it looks very presentable;
I think it is the most likely to be a very good idea, for
third issue of it they had a big editorial page saving
we are not supported by the American Embassy. He have
gathered our own funds, etc. heil, "Me thinkest thou
and the news, and the news is certainly true in that situation.
As I understand it we are, we are the most important
newspaper, but it has the look of it. None of these
newspapers have any ads or anything of this nature. I
think that when you don't have any ads or you den't have
any of the media where withal) it is always suspected of
the a special newspaper. I think even in these little
biosophy sheets, and we always find people who would
give a nominal sum, say even a dollar a month, for just


14/00/00
- 16 -
an ad just so you could use an ad advertising their book
store or dry goods. therefore I give it the appearance of a
newspaper that 14 making its own 20 and it is not just a
paid-for propaganda piece. I think there is a great
need for these kinds of news from all of these univer-
sities. I would be tickled to desistinct the new
newspaper to be special interest in this thing, to
give whatever help. I know that the Ambassador
in Salvader is very incorrect in this. He is a forcer
newspaper editor. He edited the student newspaper and
of course it hit him immediately. The newspaper
is a newspaper newspaper and perhaps that is why I am
especially aware of this kind of thing, but I think we've
issued the bonnny years in this. I think even if we
have to edit the newspaper ourselves, these organs should

I E CIGI
CONTACT REPORT
MEMORANDUM : of Contact and Conversation
Date 5 June 1962
SUBJECT:
Henry Lojos
1. Messors Dick Ouderkirk and Fortor Goss contacted Subject at the
Shorshan Hotel in room 506 N on 5 June to debrief him on his current travel
in 51 Salvador. Subject will be in Washington until Thursday, 7 June. At
de-
the Subject's request a further briefing will take place Wednesday 6 June
at 0930 hours with the benefit of a tape recorder. Subject believed that
there was sufficient material to warrant a detailed question and answer type
discussion and stated that he preferred this form reporting.
2. During the course of luncheon, at which the majority of the meeting
was conducted, the following items of interest were brought out in conversate
Most topics were discussed in generalities in view of the arranged formal
briefing scheduled for the following morning with a recorder.
a) Subject feels that them is a- chancé for real stability in the Rivera
government with the proper support from the US Government.
b) Subject stated that a alight disparity existed in the direction being
taken between the State Dept (Ambeasador) on the one hand and the cos on
the other. Specifically, Subject believed that cos was supporting elements
too far to the right.
o) The military is apparently a tine "third force" and not aligned with
th. 11 families, but broken up into conservative senior officers and an
emerging more liberal junior officer corps. Subject believed that thore may
be a possibility of getting to the campesinos through the liberal element
of the military, but not tog the 11 families.
d) 11 families are becoming isolated and have neither the full support
of the church, the military, or the government. The attitude toward the
minimum wage rate of the Rivora government seems to be "pay one half as many
twice as much. ". The cooperation of the 11 families is needed for the concost
26/253203


development of the country, but as of now they are all the way Right. As for
the minimum wage concept, the canpension apparently do not grasp it a
meaning.
e) The church is not so far Bight that it supports the 11 families and
it is tending more towards the relative left.
f) The Alliance for Progress has been badly handled, as have some of
the activities of the Peace Corps. Subject believes that. too much has been
promised through propaganda already without corresponding results. He bolioves
the danger of the program falling into ridicule is great if the US continues
to promise only, or continue it helply managl publicly asay program.
g) Discussion of the student University papers yielded Subject's opinion
that they are largely inef'ective because they deal in policies rather
than fact and news items, and because because because the ones
with too good format are obviously US pupotes.
h) Less conversation about Fidel Castro is evident in public, although
the Fidel movement is still to be reckoned with. Recently there has been a
standable by Dr. Ruff
recurances of the Martines - dictator of the 1,0's - good old days when
everybody had a job. This statement was also opgined by some expenses.
3. Subject mentioned that he had both high and low level contacts in
El Salvador and had managed to get a reading of public opinion and private
belief. Apparently it is a mistake for Rivera to delay the inauguration
so long after the election; at which time a favorable image of the Col -
was successfully kept before the public, but which is now wearing off.
4. Subject proposed the following courses of action in certain fields
that were discussed in more depth.
c) Fudio is the best means of communication with the campesinos. Subject
was impressed with the results of the operation run by the Catholic priest
in Bolivia 1 using pre-banned radios. He considers that a similar operation


would be extremely valuable if properly handled.
b) Recommends that the Lf facilities be approached on a millionaire to
ademptions that they le
unlitionaire basis in cooperate with R ressonnable reformat movement. especially the
