Bearest,
Here is the second letter that 3 in writing you.
you know, it is not only to you that 3 send letters
but also to my beliefs, to the doctors, and to my
former sisters in - law, and also to the people with
whom 3 stayed before leaving your a year ago. 3
wrote from her as soon so I could, that I have
months from the time. 3 we's received any reply
at the address 3 give: 3 hope that distant 3 with
have more lucker for there must certainly be some
reason somewhere. As frequently happen there days,
either the plane which was carrying my letters had
an accident committee as or the one which was
living back the anewers did the same thing
(e. had an accident), on, monitoring that, there new
was an answer for some reason that escapees
me. If is possible also, since 3 travel around
prasiently throughout the courtty and even abroad,

Dear Atchico,
I're been thinking for an hour and I still won't know how to
begin. I can't say that as a brother I've grecsically been a blessing.
to you, and often I've caused you more trouble than I would have liked,
directly or inciretely. My leaving Gap was inevitable. On the one
hand because of the obligation to remain there until an indefinite
time, I'm going to be able for the work. I'm now doing vich had been in
the offing for quite a while. It's easy at Abert had nothing to do with
my departure; it was only a business trip.
If I had been able to write you sooner, I would have done so. How
I can, and as there are many other things you would be glad to be
able to take them up where I've left them. I never have to
arrive the price of my actions therefore, I'm counting on you to tell me whom
you paid for me, for I presume that most people immediately thought you
were responsible for m debts. As soon as you reply, I will immediately
send you the money to reimburse you, or, if need be, to pay the inter-
ested party.
I know didn't already know, I'm notifying you that Jacqueline is
first on my list and there is no reason why she should be deprived of
what is hers. I could very well have sent her the money today, but I
don't even know if this letter will arrive at the right address. It's
more than a year since I left you, and I'm making contact again.
Next on the list ther's you naturally, whom I do not forget. Ids-
ten, what I ask is that you write me seriously, for your sake as well
as mine. Oive me the list of these people in order of urgency.
When I left Aber't, I had left instructions to pay certain people,
and I don't know if this has been done. I'm going to write to the
Dassauds, in this way, perhaps, I'll know what has happened.
I've been here a very short time and have had a lot to do in the
past few months. Unfortunately I can't tell you where, when, or what
kind of woric. I only ask that you have faith in me.
How is life at Gap? How are the girls, Elico and Irene? I would
be glad to receive a letter from them with a few pictures of all of
you, if possible. Many regards to Jacqueline with hopes that she and
hera are all well.

As far as "here" are concerned. you know that I still have a pic-
ture of my Flack (moreover, it's my only. farily album) but she must
have changed and must be a happy mother of many children, bitch that
she was.
I kiss you all and expect a letter from you.

P.S. This is my address. Since I'm often away, take care to
copy it correctly; your letter will be forwarded.

Brazilian I would say here ve mmaxx make love. Maybe this name
is less poetic than Rio de Janerio but it is more poetic in the
would
sense. Louis xitt make much money if ne wereto come here in
treating several disease cases. I hemecheese will be here for
several months and after that I think I will come and see you.
Now I am in San Paolo which is more magnificent that Rio.
In the movies you can see Bart Lancaster and Brigitte Bardot
talking in fluent Portugese.
I am now learning new language, Portuguese, which seems to
be very much like Spanish. Exemnys Everything now becomes mixed

For one hour now I have been trying to start my letter, and
don't know how to start. My departure from CAP was inevitable,
beceuse you know what my situasian was there. Had it been possible
1 would have written to you sooner. but it was not possible.
Many things have remed ned as I left them and I don't want you to
pay for anything which is my responsibility. I hope you will tell
me who you have paid and how much. A3 soon as you answer me
I will send you money. I could sendyou the money this time but
I do not know if my letter will reach you and I will try to keep
in touch with you again. When I left Ambert I left instructions
for you but I am don't know if they were carried out. I will
write to Dessaud and I will know what has happened so far. I have
been here for a few days and my very busy xixx since I left GAP
I cannot expld n what I am doing but I ask your confidence.
How are the girls. I would like tohave some photo's of them.

PAND'S 1ST LETTER To
TRANSLATION
Dear Jo and daar Lise,
I think it's about time I wrote you again. I wome
der if, perhaps, these long montha of silence bavant's caused
you to doubt my affection for you all, although before lave
ing you you knew already that where I was going, it would
be impossible for me to remain in contact with you.
How often have I seen the moment when I no longer
had the chance to write you, and nevertheless, today this is
not a good and I no longer know what to tell you -- My mind
is a blank, but I'm not all you? your turn to tell me what you
have done. Where you are I think you are going to
you see people and how are the three of your. What are you
you doing? I'm in such a hurry to hear from you that I want
to say you. Just letter even before finishing it. There are so
many things. So, I'm not going to hear you, to
read you, and to be with you as before. I'm not going to
day I'll return and we'll have fun like crazy, but this is
for later, perhaps in a few months from now? I am now the
most handnome man in Brazil. Evidently not for very long
since I arrived only yesterday, but word has gotten around
you know.
In the meantime I was travelling all over, but
above all I travelled quite a bit by air, and it can be
said that since I left you. I spent half my time flying in
the clouds with all kinds of planes, and also sometimes with-
out-planes. Sao Paulo is the pearl of Brazil. You meet a
lot of Brazilian men and some pretty Brazilian women, but
you don't understand in its to know if you are all really in
good health. by (greatest) wish would be to have a very
long letter from each of you, including little Michel.
I give all three of you a very affectionate and
big kids.
Signed I
P.S. I want to point out to you that since the
mail here leaves quite a bit to be desired and since I
travel very often, it's better to write carefully the ad-
dress I'm giving you. In any case I'll receive your letter.

RECORANDUM FOR: Director of Security
ATTENTIGN:
Alien Affnirs Staff
SUBJECT:
ARASPIC
174803
REFERENCE:
Office of Security Memo dated
18 September 1959
1. Further consideration has been given to the
holding of subject agast in the U.S. prior to the
estivation of his operation in the summer of 1960,
Maintaining him in a "hold" status abroad, probably
in Germany, was also considered. The nature and
sensitivity of the operation with which subject
agast is to be a "good" and a "good" of
status as close to Headquarters as possible.
Employment in a Handquarters element would provide
day-to-day supervision and make possible periodic
operational contacts to review questions of
security, morale, and new operational developments.
2. Therefore, SH Division solicita the
support of the Office of Security in making it
possible for us to bold the agent in the U.S.
during the near year, making the necessary
arrangements with the Attorney General.

Office Memorandum
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
TO
Chief, SR/DIV
DATE: 18 September 1959
FROM :
Director of Security
SUBJECT:
ARASTIC
174303
REF
:
SR/DOB Memorandum dated 14 September 1959
1. The subject is an alien who, at the request of SR/DIV
(for the purpose of Redsox training), was parolled into the U. S.
into the custody of the CIA in April 1959.
2. According to the referenced memorandum, the subject's
training for this purpose has been suspended until about
1 August 1950, when it will be reinstituted. This delay, it
is understood, is due to the fact that his proposed mission
has been postponed until late 1960.
3. It is observed that SR/DIV proposes that the subject
be permitted to remain in the U. S., without being in custody,
until it is not as reinstituted in late 1960, and, in the 1
interim, his service is not a part of the purpose of the
noted that the subject has, in the past, been convicted of
robberies abroad; has engaged in various nefarious activities
and that his knowledge of the English language is limited.
4. Although recognizing that the subject is undoubtedly
a likely candidate for the Redsox program, and further, that,
psychologically, it might well be preferable for the individual
and the subject in an "arrest" category, still, this
office is reluctant to place in jeopardy the arrangements made
with the Attorney General by OIA, whereby individuals otherwise
excludable can be brought into the U. S. for training or for
other operational purposes.
5. It is felt, consequently, that further consideration
should be given to the necessity for keeping AASTPIC in the U. S.
during the period he is writing for his training to be commenced.

14/00/00
In the event after full consideration, it is still deemed essential
that he remain in this 'country during the interim period, it is
suggested that the Director of Security be provided with a de-
talled memorandum of justification.

REF
:
SR/LOB Memorandum dated 14 September 1999
1. The subject is an alien who, at the request of SR/DIV
(for the purpose of Redox training), was parolled into the U. S.
into the custody of the CIA in April 1999.
2. According to the referenced memorandum, the subject's
training for this purpose has been suspended until about
1 August 1960, when it will be reinstituted. This delay, it
is understood, is due to the fact that his proposed mission
has been postponed until late 1960.
3. It is observed that SR/DIV proposes that the subject
be permitted to remain in the U. S., without being in custody,
until his training is reinstituted in a new program. The
project is to be made by TSS. It is also
noted that the subject has, in the past, been convicted of
robberias abroad; has engaged in various nefarious activities
and that his knowledge of the English language is limited.
4. Although recognizing that the subject is undoubtedly
a likely candidate for the Redox program, and further, that,
psychologically, it might vell be preferable for the individual
to feel that he is not in an "arrest" category, still, this
is not a very strong place in jeopardy the arrangements made
with the Attorney-Gen. by CIA, whereby individuals otherwise
excludable can be brought into the U. S. for training or for
other operational purposes.
5. It is felt, consequently, that further consideration
should be given to the necessity for keeping AASPIC in the U. S.
during the period he is waiting for his training to be commenced.

In the event after full conundertion, it is still deemed essential
that he remain in this country diring the interim period, it is
suggested that the Director of Security be provided with a des-
tailed -ormandm of justification.

Request for ZI utilization of agent, AASFIC
1. Background:
Subject was brought to the United States. via ERKAINBOA flight
on 20 April 1959 for training, after which he was to have been dispatched
on a black mission into the USK as a member of a RICCA team during late
1959. CI/CA Evision approved (No. C-7352) on all March 1959. The
proceed-mission was recently postponed until late. 1960, and it is
presently contemplated that subject will re-enter training for the mission
about the U.S..
2. Inasmuch as considerable time, effort and expense have been
devoted to the recruitment and training of the agent, who appear well
qualified for the mission, it is desired to retain his during the interim
in a productive capacity. Due to his rather unique background and
capabilities, it is believed he could be employed in a useful capacity
by T.S.
2. In view of the foregoing, it is presently planned to release
subject from the present C-Your custody, permit his to reside in an
apartment in Washington, D.C. under alias, and work on a daily basis
for T.S. offices in an established (TSS) covert site. The work tentatively
planned for his involves cataloging specific information taken from East
German documents, and developing and/or improving tools and methods for
pleking locis. Although USs might present other related requirements,
subject's applicant would not involve work which would preclude his
legal and legal advice.
1. By separate memoranda, CI/CA Division has been requested to
suspend subject's CA until he revenues training, and os/abien Affoirs staff
has been requested to coordinate with Immigration and Naturalisation
Office concerning subject's proposed status and documentation.
5. Your approval of paragraph 3 above is requested.
6. For further information on this subject, please contact
Mr. Portry Crclohan en extension 9331.

I do recommend, one the type of Mape and Companos are decided
upon for opie usage, that the agonts be given more work in Mape and
Compano, At any. rate, thay do need practical work now in the use of

MEXORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT; (Secerations during Period 20 April - 2 May of D. Farient.
1. Physical Descriptions
right: 5' 6'
Weight: 120 lbs.
Hair: Black - balk headed
Eyes: Dark Brown
Distinguishing marks: Missing first joints of right thumb and, right
first finger. 'ears noustache (black)
2. Physical Concitions
Subject seems to enjoy walking and running. He remarked :that he could
trot along three miles in one hour.
3. Eating Habits:
Subject is not too impressed with American way of eating, that is,
having all the food put on the table and then each taking a portion of each
course and filling up the plate.
Subject feels that more time should be devoted to eating than Joe C.
alloted for eating, is was maicd that it only took the latter about 15
minutes to eat. Likewise, Subject likes to eat one course at a time and
that each course be brought into the room and placed on the table separately.
After the meal he would like fresh fruit, cheese, coffee. He does not care
much for sweets, neither does he care for cottage cheese salad, i.e.,
the table is a "flavor" product. This combination iris him. Subject was
assured that this was a marked appearance and that it was a
custom and that the unersigned probably would be mixed some faults with the
way the French serve food. Dave enjoys fruit juice.
Dave eats his food in the manner to which he is accustomed. He puts
only one course on his plate and caly when finished eating it does he help
himself to the next course, etc.
At breakfast he is a very light eater. He is content just with
coffee, toast and juice.
1. Protects:
During the undersigned's stay with Subject, most of the freetime was
spent watching TV, walking and attending English lessons. Subject started
that he wentin to 10:00-10:00, so the undersigned accomoated him. A
35 cent Cardinal edition of "English thru Pictures" was purchased for him
and was used as the text back. Subject was caming along fairly sell in the
language. Subject is able to manage satisfactorily in the language only

thing which hinders his is his lack of coni√©ence. Time will probably
take care of his improvement,
5. General Remarks:
He was ansized that he was in the U.S.A., though he was here he stated
that he could not believe that he was here. The relative seclusion during
the past two weeks did not reassure him in myway that he definitely was
in the U.S.A. Many of his ideas regarding American seemed to be impressions
that he obtained from seeing American films while in France. Thus he has
been the most important version to place the America that he has observed now
with what preconceived ideas that he already has of America.
While in town on 23 April, his only remark about Washington was that
he did not have been actually beautifully girls (Hollywood types). He
also stated that the American sales, i.e., American Soldier in 1945, was
nice strong, healthy type of male.
Brooke from the airport Dage wore his blackout glasses until we
reached the district line. While crossing the South Capital Street Bridge
Dave-sense that we were browsing the bridge because of the variations caused
by the car passing over the steel mesh on the bridge, stated that we must
be crossing the Fotomac river now. Another question was how far was the
airport from the house where we were headed. The undersigned agreed that
we were creasing the Fotonac and that the area we were going to was over
fifty miles from the district.
By nature Dave is very curious. To satisfy his curiousity he uses
fartus ruses in order to elicit information regarding his status and
future.
Whenever the undersigned went for a walk with Dave, usually before
and after meals, the former expected to be asked numerous personal
questions. One or twice, Dave suggested that he did not know why he was
here, what kind of job he would have been.
Dave was assured that this sounded somewhat irregular, the undersigned
felt that he must have been told something somewhere along the lines, At
this point, Dave would stop asking questions. Later on the undersigned
learned that Dave was very talkative with Tom Miller (alias) and told the
latter the whole story about what was told to date. It is assumed that
Dave was trying to show Tom that he knew everything and thus hope that
Tom would fill any little details that Dave would omit. These were two
different approaches that Dave used trying to elicit information from the
undersigned.
Dave seems to be quite a perfectionist when it come to things
mechanical. while at the Log Cabin, Dave tried on of number of occasions to
adjust the IV set. Dave could not understand why the TV set sometimes
would not function properly particularly whenever a passing plane would go
over it would interfere with the sets operation. This account did not
quit his for he had to try and adjust, so as a result more time was
exended on adjusting than watching TV. He was quite iriced because he felt
that the TV was malfunctioning.

Dare likes to watch cowboy and granster films, and the children
process. This is the particiapants spoke very slowly
and he could understand the language.
Ferlocally, Dave would cuestion the undersigned on schedule for the
cigarette industry. The first one is: seemed that he won't fail to hear
what we told to his and later. The time of the show was the
not like the idea that he had to start English from basic he wanted to
have something more advance.
Dare like to test others and it seems that he will continually do so
throughout the course.
Dave didn't seem to impress with the idea that he had to be
debriefed all over again. His comment was that he told this over and
over so many takes and that it was not necessary to do over again. At
Miss when I's dis not want to answer a question he would state that he
already told this to converge and drop the matter there.
1 May 1997.
Dare likely before Dave's departure for another advantage. Dave remarked
that he was not much concerned about the training that he will have to
undergo during the next phase but is concerned more about what has
he was driving at was to try to elicit what information he could regarding
the work that he will be required or expected to fulfill once training is
over, i.e., the mission. Dave was assured that this naturally would follow
only after the completion of the training, then he would be informed by
the people concerned that at this time such information could not be given
him.
That evening, the undergained stayed with Dave and Albert at the new
safehouse. At super remarked about the manner in which the food was served
that it was not according to French custom. Albert said you eat the way
you want, yet at the same time filling up his plate.
After supper, Dave querying Albert about the property, to whom does the
land beling etc. all Albert could say that it all belongs to the man who
owns the house and left natters drop at that.
Dave was quite witty at the supper neal today. This was the first
time that the undersigned seemed to see him in such jovial spirits. Both
men seemed to hit it off very well. Dave seemed to recognize Alberts brown.
Dave seemed to like the cooking better at the new location. He
stated that this place wasmuch better that the other place. He stressed
that the housekeepers here were much better that the others.

The fire-brigade had to batticulate the father about his part in the
he did not say anything. He's father about his part in the
brand he explained his red face why much running when playing
the fire in place came David's fault was detected, his fa-
ther had to pay the dages, he had not enough money for this.
7.David's father had, by this time, given up taxi driver's job.
He was working on different inventions. He was sure he had
discovered petrol fields in France. He was a very good
le invented a device in the electric replay of records; he
asked for 900 miles a little but was offered 400 only.
He was a movie projector with which David was not allowed
to play. Thus, David consued his own projector and showed
it to the father. Father was thrilled, and allowed it to
use his (fathers) projector. Davidson said.
7.A.In this school David made much more of the message. He thinks that the
reason for this was the first person who up: he was small and his
name made the first one, an children laugh and mock him. He wanted
him to thank that he was a full guy. He got his third reprimand
when he burned carbide in an incstand. He was thrown off
when he planted a cracker in a restroom, he was a woman of
the school and a teacher field. He was a glassin of the rest-
room when the cracker explored. An other pupil, Haron GELLITZ
had seen him from the cracker and had reported this.
8. He was a neighboring to the house where David lived,
reided ten single Georgians who had made some resistance
to the Russians during N.W I or after this. David used to
visit those men, he was something like a mascot of theirs.
They had a dog and an ape. They taught the trick:
Six of the men were poorly placed drivers for the sub-
stance. He was a senior. One stood at home, cooking for all,
and one, Akhutza CHCLORASHULL, was the boss. David re-
members' some names or nicknames of them:CHCLOR, SANILKIO,
CANCARSTZELL, SERRO (died), COLA.

9. After having been thrown out from the Lycke: Hoche, David was
sent to a comunale school in Jiroflex, some of the three years
in the 19th century, and the 19th year the street car,
however, he did not take the car: he used the money to buy what
he needed for his silly things and acts.
10. At the end of the term David was taken back to the Lycke:his
mother, probably, had asked for this, and had given some many,
one: can do everything with money. I remained in this school
until they moved back to Paris, to Vanves.
11.
David's contact with Jean Adam contriued up to the beginning
of the war. David has never abtruded himself to him. He follo-
ved many plans of Jean; although he was sure that he could have
made better plans: The parents of David and Jean had nothing
in common; although they knew one-annther however, it happens
to the 19th century. I lived Somewhere in the vicinity of David,
and when Tzitzichy will-3 moved to. Farris Vanves, was: lived near
the Farte rangoon.
12. In Vanves David was sent to Lycke Michelet. After six months
he was thrown out. They were served some vegetables in this col-
lege at lunch times. Once a plate with vegetables was caught
by a pupil when this was upon to fall down, and the catcher
was glad. David, however, took the plate with the same
it to the floor, moog: it. The supervisor came and asked how did
the person happen. David told the truth, through how out of the
schools.
13. Then David, 13 or 14, he was to a community school. There he
had to take a test to the "terrificat d'Etudea" it took the
first, written parent, the test, and after it, during the lunch
and the first, was in‰∏ãÊªë by a bricklayer's work that he star-
ted to help the man, also because he was promised 10 Francs for
this. When he later inquired about the time, he learned that
he was already late for the oral part of the test, he was
not go for it: he continued to work, to each school, he
lower, he was paid nothing to the town out from the
14, he was a member of the other communal school in the same
area. There he had a fight with an other pupil wi:3 threatened
him with a knife. David forced the knife from him and threw it
away. The knife stick: high in the wall of a house. The other
boy reported the case making him, David, looking guilty, and
he was thrown out of this area. He was a girl who had a device in his mouth. to
this school there was a pupil who had a device in his mouth. to
address the time of the boy used this device to make queer
15. The men said.
Then David was sent to a professional school, "Art et itier",
in Chalion sur Carre. At this time his parents were living some-
where to the east of Paris. There. David remained for 1,5 years
and, again, was thrown out because he, instead going to classes
went to the a tice of the building and practiced there

throwing of a big xnire. This was made noise, he was detec-
ted and thrown out.
16: In this school he belonged to the "leading" trio of the
school the others being an Italian inizini about 14, and
a French boy Teller (13).
17: The first Thursday the school went for walks.
Their supervisor probably had a girlfriend whom he visited
during these walking periods, leaving the boys on their own.
18: He was a teacher of the school. He was a senior man.
On one such a case the trio decided to find out.
They had all toogenerifices with women, and it was decided
to have women. He was a very comprehensive
to have women. However, Teller, the youngest backed out and
so did l√§nzinil. But he, David, to show his marliness, went
upstairs with the woman-who asked the students to be asked
him to wear a chair. He said. He said. He did. The room was cold,
and he later was cold, he nearly "lost" his penis. Bat, with
the help of the woman; khaaxkowoo he managed the act, and
felt proud when he returned to the others. However, since then
he had a kind of mixed feelings toward the women, shiness,
fear and attraction all together, and he did not have any
cigarette.
17. His father was angry with him because he again was thrown
out of the school. Father told that he is good but for a
hog-heard. but, nevertheless, he was sent to an other school,
Ecole breguet, for electrotechnicians, in 1937.
But, there, also, he was thrown out.
18. Thereupon he left the parents' home, lived for three months
in an hotel and worked nightly in the railroad station, un-
loading kwa ofsters. He said. He said. The father took him
back to the hotel to the school of photography and movie
be the corner of Rue Littree and Rue Vaugirard, close to an
other school where he had been earlier. There he remained
for two half-terms, March-July, and Cetober - -May, having
not finished the course, because the German-Polish war star-
ted.
19. Sometimes between his going to Ecole Preguet and the
school of photography he had stolen an English dictionary from
a library. This came out, however, he was not put in jail.
The only effect was that his normal identity papers of c state-
less person were withdrawn and replaced by temporary papers
which he had to renew every three months. He did not do this,
and after 6 months he was taken and held by the police for 13
days before he was given new papers.

C. Period of Wd II:
1. In Decevier 1939 David reported in Paris to a depot of the
French Foreign Foreign Foreign Foreign Legion.
15 days later he was sent to Lion; and from the French
week-stay, the arseilles: From Narseilles he was shipped to
Chen and further sent to Gidi-Beifables in Algier, then to
the French Legion, the February-legiment. There Lieutenant
De WARTEN sent him to Courea's for NOSOS.
2. But soon ar order was received to send all Legionnaires
and the American where special units had to be formed of
different naticialities and the American Indians, and thousands
of legionnaires of other nationalities were sent to Caracas.
They remained idle, doing but very little exercising.
3. After the German-French hostilities ended, those foreign
legionnaires were returned from Barcares to Paris and dischar-
ged, including David. lie went back.
4. lie looked for work. A Georgian had recommended him to go to
Germany where a Georgian Legion was being formed for the fight
against the Soviets. Archilles GUDEDVANICHVILLI was said being
gathering people for this purpose. David's father told him
that a Georgian.EDLIA is the man who organizes this in connec-
tion with the Germans. David went to this man, had a talk
with him, but did not like the idea.
5. When David reported to the German Labor Office in Paris,vo-
ton bearing as an electrician for work in Germany. He was sent
to the other, near SERTIN, HIDRIVER WARD, with a contract for
one year.
6. He remained there for some three months: a mate of his,
PASCAL (first name), did not like the work, and both decided
to quit, to go " on leave".
7. They had no valid German travel documents. It was impossible
to travel with the identity card issued by the factory if there
was/leave certificate travel documents issued by the police.
8. The other story is confused: as the debriefer recollects,
David spoke to the other of the debriefing that he had
help from a girlfriend who put out the "briefing" which
he had prepared for the forged certificate of leave, to visit
his sick uncle in Berlin. On the second day he revoked this,
the other this must have been a misunderstanding, he had
spokes out of the first two, but he influence, about a later case
when he had help from a girlfriend.
David went to the police in Stetin, and somehow managed
to get the travel documents, valid until 2 June, to visit his
sick uncle in Berlin ( who did not exist at all).


9
C. In Stettin David met a KEDIA-man, but again refused to
join this organization, and he was asked to be the there
to be a "good" message. He got to Paris, was asked and took
some letters for delivery in Paris and took the train up to
Achen.
9. In Achen he asked a Frenchman how to get to Frances. He was
advised that the German GESTAFO is giving necessary permits.
10. How David 'afieldifed his leave permit, changing the validity
date from 2012, and he was asked to be the right to the califica-
tion of his protected. However, he was not allowed to travel
to Paris because his leave and travel document showed but
Berlin as his place of destination, and he was ordered to re-
turn to Berlin.
11. Instead of returning to Berlin David took the train up to
two km from EPEBI, in order to pass the EXPOXOMMISASy border
in the EUPEN-IAMIEDY area clandestinely. He is asked somebody
for advise how to cross the border, and he was sent to a man
who agreed to take him from the city.
12. David had but he was a man Harks. He told this to the guide
to the city. He said he he will have to pay him. The man asked
20 Marks. During the night the guide took him to a place,
indicated David a direction arx to follow for crossing the
border and to arrive to the railroad station on the other
side of the border. This was all he was offered for the 20 DM.
13. David waited until the guide left. Then, fearing that the
guide could have directed him into a trap, he took a direc-
tion 90 degrees to the left. He said he was a man who was
not asked to be a reaction for about half an hour, and turned
then 90 degrees to the left, thus into the old, advised direc-
tion. Drinill: he had and i in to turn later once more
to the left and thus he was a man who was not asked to
be a reaction for the 20 DM. He was a positive for the
his walk. However, when he had reached a road, he noticed a
man on bycleic approaching towards him. He hid himself in the
culvert, and when the man was quite close, he, David, who
out, frightened by the man. He was a man who was not heard her
and was a man. Receiving a positive reply, he then as-
ked how to proceed to the railroad station. The man showed
him the direction to the next farm, and advised to ask for
further information there - it would have been too complica-
ted to advise for all the way. David thanked and left for
the farm. The man, glad to escape from his charger, offered
him some cigarette.
14. David found nobody in the farm. He, thus, proceeded on his
own, and finally reached the railroad station. Before boarding
the train, he went to a barber, to shave and to clean his


-10-
clothes. He had. but 32 German Harks left. He asked the bar-
ber how much the railroad ticket warur-raris would cost, and
the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of
tions of the money exchanged. He had just enough for the ticket
with a few remaining for something to eat.
15. David bought the ticket and borded the train. He asked other
travelers about the controls. He was told that the German
military personnel is performing the control at the Belgian-
French border. He thought to leave the train before the bor-
der, to cross the border clandestinely arrived in the car. He
had a 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the
more, the control-tean, a Lieutenant, a n.0.0.0 and two man,
was there already. The officer marched up to David, looked
him into the eyes, then turned his back to David and shouted
the 100% of to hurry up. David had luck: he had no documents,
and nobody was not. He was a member of the probably thought
to be. Lieutenant had checked his document.
16. He felt happy, but the others told him that there will be
one more check, at the "red zone" ( 1 a zone rouge ) rear
S.A.I. 100% Thereupon: David left the compartment and ap-
proached in the corridor of the car(a railroad employee. He
showed the person his ticket, told that the 100% of the 100% of
the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the Frenchman, help

had to be a 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the

JOHO or JCHIO and thus he learned that this was the name of
the director. He does not remember the address of the place
where he lived.
19. In this factory there was a chemical laboratory with a
Dutch laborer: this man slowed David so meÔøΩ SAVES made of
platis, which he said using for different mixing work: later
some of these bowls were stolen. He, David, was suspected,
and his living place was searched, but - he had not taken those
bowels.
20. later he got in trouble league he had been to movie with
a German girl another girl, who was Jealous, had reported
this, and he was fired: a forstiger had no right to go with
the other people. He was a very good man was made to be "horosrab-
le", an- he could apply for a new job.
21. David went to the Labor Cifice, showed his discharge papers,
and was directed to a factory in the STAMISCHIERSTRASSB,
Perlin, Moritsplatz. The factory was producing steel annuni-
tion belts for aircraft machine guns. The technics used in
this factory were primitive. David invented a simple machine
for adjustment of the right grip necessary. He said the cart-
ridges in the belt. The director was much pleased.
222 In Berlin David met PASCIL against the left both got the idea
that it is enough for them of the left. He was Germany, and they
deem the air in the air. He was a great Brazil.
They needed passports, such for foreigners. To get those,
they needed certificates of leave from their working places.
Thus, David went to a Labor Cifice, to the prettiest girl, and
asked for two leave certificates. The girl was obliging how-
ever said, that the factory must issue the certificates, not
as a result of the use of a new or a new machine. He was
siced, that he did not ask for the certificates, but for the
blank forms, so he could bring those to the factory.
He got the forms, filled them in, forged an imprint of the
stamp of the factory by copying the form of the bulb, stole
the factory. He said, he said the office of the foremen and
made an other imprint with a cachet found there. It was easy
for him to enter the office because he was living in the same
building with the factory, and when he needed warn water for
the factory. He said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he
and from there it was close to the "studio" overlossion (atel-
ier): there was not much danger of being sent. They the right
guard as the operation did not take long time.
24. With the leave certificates ready, David returned to the
same girl in the Labor Cifice from whom he had received the
forms. The obliging girl stamped the certificates "registered;
entered their names into a carifile, and thus, David and Fas-

32. Then they were stopped by the French gendarmes who thought
that they were Germans David quickly inverted the story of the
their flight from the occupied zone for the French
Legion. The gerdarnes took a little white where David could
buy a pair of the French shanks, canvas shoe only and of too lar-
ous. The 100% of the new they were directed to a company of that Legion,
to LODEN. The chief of this company gave them a horse park to
go to the tincental 3. in arseilles, camp de Sainte Parthe,
33. There arrived; David advised Fascal to go to the registrat
the first; so they both could see whether he; as a Frenchman,
will be accepted without showing his German passport. David,
being a Gecrrian; did not want to be a very good place.
Fascal we have been a good and to believed. To prove his being
to be a very good and hat a German as suspected, he showed his Ger-
man passport for foreigners. This made the situation worse,
and Pascal was happy to get out without being arrested.
34. Both retreated. David decided to return to Faris. Pascal
did not want to return and said that he will go to Algiers, to
get a job on the construction of the Algiers - ligiera rail-
road. They departed.
35. David, or his way back to Paris, reached Lion. There he went
to one of his far relatives, Charles, and asked
whether the latter could help to get a permit to go to the
German-occupied camp. He paid the thought this being a simple
matter, being a he had a good friend in the Security (Querte).
However, the relative failed, nearly got in trouble himself,
was advised David to dissappear quickly,what the latter did.
36. Somehow David managed to pass the French control by showing
his German passport. The guard misunderstood his difficult na-
me, and let him pass as Corporal Fritz VIII.
37. But the German post stopped him, David, and started a skiing
different questions. David demanded to be brought to the chief
of guards. i.e was taken to a,whom he, again, asked to
be brought to an officer. He was brought to a "Sturmbanf√ºhrer"
(Aajor In-the S3). David explained to this officer something of
having visited his brother in'sareilles. The officer nicely
helped hit to return to Faris.
38. Back in Faris, David went to the parents. The mother macked
him about his quick return from Brazil.
39. Soon David reported to the German Commanduntra in Paris,
to volunteer as a driver to the... the Transportation Corps
of the Kazy Party. To was accepted and sent to Berlin, MUGEL-
ICHI LAGRA, close to OBTIGEN. He knew to drive, he had a
driver's license since 1938.
After some three or four months of training they were distri-


-14-
buted to different places in Berlin. He came to a unit sta-
tioned close to the FRANDER BURGER TOR, vis-a-vis to the French
and the French where he had to wait and drive a cab for
eight hours the day and lived in the same house in front of
which their cars were studied. He was a very good
names from the time of this training period. One of his co-
drivers in this small unit was
40. David remained in this drivers' unit in Berlin until some
three to four months later, volunteers were called to go to
France, as lorry-drivers to the West coast where the Atlantic
wall was being constructed. He volunteered, and 15 days later,
together with other volunteers, he was sent to Paris.
41. In Paris they were given French-made Fords of five ton loc-
ding capacity (U - charge title). The convoy of some 50 cars,
and 15 days later, the Fords, started in direction to SAIT NAZAIRE.
At the departure, the Fords had been asked a di Kreians,
one driver had an accidence: he could not take the Fords, and
on the sidewalk; killed and damaged a few people, without da-
caging the car. David, who interpreted at the spot when the
case was cleared, was ordered to take this car over, because
the Fords had the accidence, was not allowed to con-
tinue to drive immediately.
42. The convoy was divided into three parts, with David going to
the detachment while was detailed to the havy. This was approxi-
mately at the time when the British made a mock landing or a
demonstration of a landing.
43. In 19th, still on the French West coast, the HSCM can were
ordered to take an oath. David refused, and as the conse-
quence, was sent back to Derli:, guarded by two me, into a
34. penal or refractory camp.
44. David asked the leader of this camp, an"Obersharfinner"
(equivalent to a :0.0.0.1) / later David changed the grade to
"Hauptstrufhrer" - equivalent to a Captain/ for permission
to contact the Folice Headquarters, for volunteering into the
police service. The campaigner granted him six-hour leave
of the following: the following: the following: to face a tough
deal because of his refusal to take the oath.
45. David went to the Folice II.2 at ALKANDERLAND in Berlin,
was accepted and given a note that he had registered for the
service in the Folice. He returned with this note to the
and on the next morning he was released on ground
of this note.

46. In the Police David had to take physical examination in a
35 and Police hospital. He was found fit physically and was
sent into barracks of which he does not remember the address.
His grade in the police was "Hott-Machtmeister - Dolzetscher"

flight into which he was thrown by two men, the catcher got
frightened, backed out, David, as a consequence, fell to the
ground, and broke one arm, the elbow, and damaged the other
arm. He remained for some 44 days in hospital, the same in
which he had the physical examination when entering the police
service.
48. When released from the hospital, he was given a convales-
ence certificate which kept him free of work. He had to go
periodically for checks and for renewal of this certificate.
After he had been for those checks and renewals for a few ti-
mes, he started to forge the signature of the physician and
"renewed" the certificate himself.
49. During his stay with the police force in Berlin, and also
when he was "convalesing", he had a private room hired at
AURPORTSENDAR 26, or "now. exactly" 26 - he said not this to
remember the exact number of the house.
50. Then he got the idea to leaficly a document relevaing him
for a longer period of time from checks with the police unit.
This had to be a certificate showing that he had to undergo
the certificate of the certificate.
51. He had a glorlfriend, Astere SUND-AZI-HADASSI, a half-
Azerbaijan, who was fluent in German and in French. David as-
ked her to put the medical certificate into good official
German. Then he forged the cacients and the signature of the
physician, the same who had written the renewals of his dis-
ability certificate.
52. He presented this forged certificate to a clerk in the offi-
ce of his police unit. He was on good terms with the clerks
there, he was a "friendly foreigner" who joked and spoke about
his own, and his father, who was a member of the doctor, who
corresponding note in his files, and this was enough for David
for the case that somebody would ask about his whereabouts:
he did not need to rely any more or. the forged document: the
clerk had made an official entry intc the books, and there
was no way to check, neither to doubt it this entry.


-16-
53. During those three months of "gurgical operation" David
get in contact with TRami LRD. IPARIDEE, a boyfriend of his
sister lielen who worked with the East inistry (Cst-Iiniste-
ment) Pradly, who worked with the "SD" (Gicherheitsdienst, -
Securit, and the end who later married Helen, had just re-
ceived order to go into Paris.
54. David asked I to give his travel document or order
for a short time to see he could show those to his suppe-
rior and to ask for similar. He had a trail obliged. David pho-
tographed the documents - he has a intention to show those
to his boss, he was going to make his own documents.
55. His sister brought him some forms which were used in the
Ost-Binisterium, and he collected others more from different
offices.
56. Thus, David prepared for himself a falicied travel docu-
ment to Paris, signing it with the name of Folice President
RADENIAN. This name he has used on many documents in later
times.
571. Before using this document he checked it, or made a re-
hersal with his girlfriend. lie gave the falcified document to
the girl for inspection, and then, soon after this, he pushed
a full-time police passport above the false paper, asking the
girl because he was not and findings. She said that she had
understood that the first time he was not. He was the
had not had enough time to read it through, in full. This
David explained, was the trick: one has to give the falci-
fied paper first, and then, without giving the checker enough
time for its study, insert an other, genuine document which
could irrit the attention of the checker, detract it from the
facilities.
58. David used this trick with the controls and had a smuth
journey to Paris.
59. In Paris David contacted the engraver ArLUI, corner of the
streets use ilics di bevalve and recuunct
be
e ased. Allou to prepare the. it seti of the
dilaturers. The shon consented after a shirt hesitation, af-
ter David had spoken of Frenchmen's moral duty to help other
people against the Germans. The sane man made for David
later many more seals and stamps of different German offices,
like the majority Service, the East-Linistry, the Labor Office
the Police headquarters and the travel permission stamp for
the passports.
60. By the intermediary of this ALLOU David let also be printed
different forged letter- and order-forms of the above centio-
ned offices, in thousands of copies, sofar those did not have
filigee sets printed in. However, is personally was able


-17-
to prepare by hand the riligree net if the document needed it.
61. To the question of the debriefer concerning the expenses
of all this immense woni. David Explained that all this cos-
ted him over 10,000 French rancs. Later he changed this sum
to 140,00 to 15,000 rancs.
62. At first he made money by reselling pliden-watches of his
friends, as well as other objects, receiving good gains.
63. Then he had three friends in Berlin, French radio-engineers
who had been brought to the other. He was a former
director of the business of those Friends were: IUCAS. ALLUMES
and VILEALI. Lucas and Vilemain wanted to have traveldocu-
meits to Paris. The father of Lucas was a wealthy man in
Paris.
64. When David was preparin. for his own Journey to Paris, he
let Lucas write a letter to his father, asking him to give
David 200,000 Francs. The father obliged.
65. Besides, and especially after he had his eaches ready, he
earned plenty of money through his operations on the black-
market, buying coffe at the French-Spanish frontier for 50 Ger-
man Karks the kilogram, and resciling it in Berlin for 900 to
1200 Hark the kg.
66. He personally had made 3 or 4 trips to the Spanish border
for coffee, and four other men have done this for him.
67. Those trips were easy, especially the French part of them
on which were no special checks. or were the trips dangerous
because the luggage of military personnel was not searched,
and nor was the luggage of police force.
68. When making and using these confiet seals, one had to pay
attention to the number of the unit in the seal which to use:
those numbers referred to the type of the work and the impor-
tance of the offices, f.i. "Ih" would show that the seal was
of an unimportant small office, whereas the right number to
use was pernings three or four.
69. Before lettering Lucas to the forged papers, David wanted
to check the papers on somebody else.
70. David had a hair-Jewal KATZ DEEAN. His mother, born
in the American Medical and Jew iats, and later, in a se-
cond marriage program. A son from this first marriage was
now using the name of DISAUM, however, was urder the pressu-
re of a certain WERBERT who knew of his Jewish origin.
natz asked David to prepare papers for the Spaniard WERMEAT
for an official trip to Spain. David agreed, however asked f.
two old genuine Spanish passports for this purpose.


-18-
71. He got the old passports, those could be e asily bought on
the front of the road out of those two passports he made a new
one for. Werwert.
72. David went into details in describing how he prepared the
wearing a new one for the first two photographs which
was fixed by students, and thus, could not be the most important
ly replaced i.e. nad to use plenty of skilled washing and mas-
ter-photography for remouving the old image and replacing it
by the new one without damaging the passport, nor the "photo-
graph" itself.
73. Wenvert used the passport. He was instructed by Xetz to
report in Spain to a priest who was in contact with Atz.
The signal from the priest came, "Werwert had arrived without
trouble. At this occasion atz disclosed to David that "Werwert
was not a Spaniard, as pretended, but a German.
74. How David prepared the documents for Lucas and Vilemain:
to report as specialists to the Labor Office in Paris.
75. David had arranged with Lucas to acknowledge his safe arri-
val in Paris. The woman, in whose house the Lucas 'es lived
in the city. The king in the German Commandantura in Paris.
Through her David was a great book of the book of the book of
of the family of a german soldier "operator of the switch-
board of the Commandantura in Paris. The fanily lived in Ber-
lin. Some coffee was given to the soldier and he was urged
to phone his wife in Berlin and to tell that he had received
a special letter her. This was the signal announcing safe
arrival of LOR. He was a crisis. David told that this signal was
used in some ten cases.
76. David had issued false travel documents to some 14 persons.
One of them was a friend of Lucas in Berlin, whose name and
home address were: ienry JOLLY, 5, Rue Jaretti,Paris XV.
77. Somelow David became an idea to join the "ABEEN" of the
German Armed Forces, something more important and exiting
than his previous activities. He had no good idea of the
real scope and of the structure of the "Abwenn". He went
to the first two years of the first two years of the first two
The porter at the entrance asked him to which branch he
wanted to go. David told "West" whereupon the porter had said
that he should go. to "West -Inz" (1 West), and instructed him
into which room to go. There David found an officer wo ex-
plained to him that the office had been moved to
FETDRA.
79. David went to Pctzdam. It took him hours until he found
TAiN.E, an area surrounded by barbed wire, heavily guarded,
all guards being i., C3. He showed his police passport and
asked to be brought to the chief of the guards. He was brou-

brought to a lien-ment who took him to a Golden. The latter,
having heard that David wanted to get employed, this means that
he did not Siong to the organization, got had, did not helie-

into a top secret area), and 388000 how he learned about the

David, then was asked with he could do, his name was registe-
red; and he was told that he will be contacted later.
79. Through a chain of persons, linked to LUCAS, David got a
request to prepare documents for a Belgian girl's Journey to
Paris. ne consented.
80 He met the girl, like many other persons, outside of his
living place on different places, and under good security
precautions, f.1.1 somebody entered the meeting place on his
behalf and asked the person who was awaiting him to come out
i.e., David, was at that time out observing the environs, to see
whether somebody was a person who was a person. If then
we were not to be done, the. he followed his people, and asked
them in a safe place. He never brought them to his living
place. But LUCAS and VILEAN had been to his quarters.
81. Before he had finished the documents for the Pelgion girl,
he and ALLURES had found after an iriradi an unexploded incen-
diary bomb. Allumes had explained that such a bomb, having not
exploded when coming down, is harmless. The other people
were not the same. The man who was not the eyes, tried to take
out the capsule. The capsule exploded. The thumb and the fore-
finger of his left hand were de-aged, and Allumes got a splin-
ter into his face. The landlady was mad: the fools are playing
with bombs, ruining her hause which was saved in the airraid.
She wanted to report them to the police, but David called her
down, saying that he himself will report the case, he himself
was a man.
82. At the same time the Selgian girl happened to come and saw
David injured. She showed no grief because of the pains cau-
sed to David and the loss of his fingertips, - she was angry
that she could not have her papers and could, thus, not start
her pleasure trip to Paris.
83. It took injured David three days until the documents for the
girl were ready, and an appointment was made to meet her in
the AMALIER FAMHOF wherefrom the trains to Paris wore star-
ting after the Potsdamer Bahnhol was deolished. The meeting
was fixed for 2200h.
84. David went for the meeting together with ALLURES, KAZZ and
ASTREED. They found the station rather empty and they thought
that they had come too early. But then David noticed the


-20-
Belgian girl just at the platform give. ie approached her-
She told Decid that he will be arrested imeilately, and un-
deed, all around there came men with machine pistols ready.
All but the Belgian girl were arrested, and hold separately.
His was on 22 February 1944.
85. David was held for a few days in a room chaired by his right
to be a good deal of the people who had a single
word with him. He was brought some food like it is being made
with a dog.
86. His injuned hand was not cared for at all and started to
fester. Then he lamented about this, he was transferred to
a hospital where he was put into a large ward together with
many more people.
87. He pieticed a telephone in the coricer of the ispital. He
askedya coil from a Dutch pietic and placed to the pelgian
girl, asding her to ring his some civilian clothes. lie still
did not believe that this girl had betried him.
88. The girl promised to come to see him the next day at 1000H.
He sure, get a visit the next day at 10, but by guards who
took him to the hospital in TEGEL jail. Now it was clear to
David that the Belgian girl was in contact with the German
police.
89. From the Tegel jail he was daily taken for questioning to
the police H.4.
90. A few months later, when his fingers had nearly healed, he
was transferred into a cellar of the police H.4.
91. lils questioning continued for nine months, with the sessi-
ons at first daily, then two to three times a week, later
once in a week or biweekly. The charges were heavy: grave
forgery, damaging the security of the state, demoralization
of the foreign. laborers, helping the FCI to flee, and espio-
nage (some photos of the bomb-damaged Berlin were found in
the living place).
92. Sometimes before his arrest, David had organized the move
of the first and sister from Berlin to Vienna, of course
with forged, and however, the fairly being not
aware of the falcifications.
93. After his arrest the parents came from Vienna to see him.
lie does not know whether they were brought by the authorities
or did they come at their own initiative. The evidences of
his crimes were displayed in the S ame room where he not his
father. It was then that the father learned that he, David,
had forged the traveldocuments for the move of the family,
that there was no police president Rademann whose name the
documents showed, that David had invented this name. It's


-21-
ficer was very much enuarrassed.
94. During the interrogations David was asked many times for
who the did all those things, for whien intelligence service
and the business, and the business is a challenge achieved so
much without any big foreign service behind him.
95. The police inspectors had hnted him that he would not es-
cap the death sentence. to gain time, he wrote a letter
of the 19th day. He said, "I think that the police
worked without gas, - in those days, cerres being very short
of gas; such an invention should attire attention.
96. He was contacted and asked for details of his invention.
He told something and requested better living conditions and
food, so he would be able to work on this invention. He also
mentioned that some details of the invention are in Vienna
and should be brought from there to Berlin. (at that time
that the tobacco is supplied by the Russians). Later two
specialists were sent to check his information They
found that the idea was among the people theoretically, and he was
urged to continue to work on its own.
97. In connection with the approach of the front to Berlin,
they, this means David, Katz and Allumes, were transferred to
WILTRFURTEL jail, rear HAROVER. He does not know what happe-
ned to Aster√©e.
98. In Wolfenbuttel they remained for some three months, until
the Americans freed them in April 1945.
99. They went to KASEL Discharge Camp, wherefrom he
ard Allumes went to Paris, whereas Katz went his own way.
D. Additional explanations to the activities during 1999 II.
1. The photographs which David had made of the documents of
Irakil Lordzepanizde were not good enough. So he had to en-
large the photos as much as he could, up to the size of a few
square feet. He ameliorated the enlarging by some pencil work.
The work was applied the earlcing and produced new good
photos of the documents in the exactly right size of the ori-
ginal documents.
2. All the photocraphe lab work was done in his hotel room.
He used two NIKUES and one CCNTAX, and a French type enlar-
ger with the objective of his Contax. The equipment costed
him over 100,000 ( it was not specified whether French Francs
or German Haris).

3. David's father needed money for its inventions. David gave
this 100,000 D. through a third person, whose 100,000
from whom the money came. This was before David's journey to
Brazil!
4. David had plenty of money, mostly earnou by selling coffee
on black market. once he was bought in Berlin for ten 4%
coffee a car, an oil.
5. The secrgians in cerilid did not know of his doing sand re-
lations in derina much, although the most of the other or did
ADHIA cow anythor or the 100,000 ed by this. when arranging
the 100,000 people of the 100,000 people of the 100,000 people of
media for his car. The request was refused David, then, hired
a 100,000 people of the 100,000 people of the 100,000 people of

vid had replied that 100,000 car. now see that David can have as
many cars as he just likes, although. Nadia did not give his
when asked.
6. For the move of his parents from Berlin to Vienna David had
reserved ar: apportment that train, again using false docu-
ments. To this he said that it is difficult to get reserved
to the 100,000 people of the 100,000 people of the 100,000

road car or train for a special reason, because the greater

higher authorities decide the issue, the less effective is the
factual check of the 100,000 people of the request and of the docu-
ment. The request is made.
7. As to the motives of his not joining the Georgian Legion:
He, David, does not feel being a Georgian, or too much.
a Georgian. He hates the Russians in general, although the
has nothing special against any particular, a certain one. The Rus-
sian communists he divided by a person more than the ordinary Russian
ans. There was a season why he did not join the eddia
and the 100,000 widely (idea. 100's: this contradicts
with his statements made during the first day of the debrie-
fing, according to which he was ready to fight together with
anybody (even with the devil's grandmother) against the con-
munists.

II. ANALYSIS.
1.
The debriefer was instructed to conduct the debriefering
in a most friendly way, so that David would not get suspicious
about the purpose of this debriefering.
2.
David was asked by Charles to tell the debriefer his bill
story, so that this could be used in planning of the cover-stor
for his future activities.
3.
In compliance with those instructions, the debriefer gave
David full freedom of telling the story in his own choosen way,
without being much interrupted. He was asked but a few explana-
tory questions, so far the question was the question of
any question. The debriefer was in the situation to
any those intelligently he himself did not have much advance
information on David. In some cases David asked whether an
item he was just telling, was important or necessary for the
planning of his coverstory, what in most cases was confirmed.
4.
However, David did not give the full story in its de-
tails. Besides, there are some contradictions between the diffe-
rent parts of his story. Some events, as described by him, seem
to be unbelievable.
5.
Unfortunately, the debriefer is not in commend of short-
hand, and he has no support of concealed tape-recorating. Thus,
the debriefer and the memory of the debriefer were the only
sources of information when the debriefing report was later
written. Due to this, some details of the story got ict or
confused, especially when it appeared that David changed some
details during the second session cf the debriefing.
6.
To clear those points, additional questions should be
asked. Some of those questions can still be asked without alar-
ming David's suspicions, whereas others are of course, the would
be asked to be asked that those are asked for trial purposes.
This should be born and the same is the final list of
additional questions, and when deciding the conditions under
which those shall be asked.
7.
The here given list of additional questions is but a
tentative one, drafted on the basis of this one debriefing re-
port only. (See: 1,1 and 2.)
8.
The question of the second and the numbers in front of each
question refer to the corresponding items in this debriefing
record, or, if such items do not exist, indicate the need to
cover additional items.
The small letters are for later references to the addi-
tional answers or sub-items.

C. CHARACTERISTIC TRAITS IN HIS ACTIVITY.
1. Irrational instability.
As a child he gets thrown out of six schools for having
done nonsense. ( Ref. : B 7,12,13,14,15,17.)
Nor does he finish the last, the photography and movie
school, although he is about 21 years of age and should thus,
be able to think for himself. ( B 18.)
Instead, he volunteers into the French Foreign Legion, thus,
going in war against the Germans. ( C 1.)
Later he volunteers for work in Germany, stays on jobs
3 to 4 months then flees the country ( twice ), and after a
few days out of Germany, volunteers again for work there,
all without any good, compelling reason. ( C 18,22; 39,40.)
The reasons for changing his jobs when in Germany or with
the Germans; and the situations in which he changes or
contemplates to change his jobs, are unreasonable, if not un-
believable. ( C 45, 77.)
2. Lack of motivation.
He thinks that during the school age it was the inferiority
complex that made him do nonsense: he wanted to show up despite
being small in growth and having a funny name. (B 7a, 16.)
He is no to doing anything for material gain he has done
none of his special activities for money, and he won 't do this
in the future. ( E 22).
He has no ideological motivation, neither patriotic, nor
enough political feelings: he does not feel being a Georgian,
he is not interested in the Georgian Throne, he has partly for-
gotten the Georgian language, and he wanted to register as a
French American.
Although he "hates the Russians in General", and even more
the Soviet-Russians, this hatred was not strong enough to make
him join the German-sponsored Georgian anti-Soviet unit. (C 48.)
His longing for thrill and excitement, the single remaining
motivation, seems to be limited to the more-less comfortable,
physically easy activities, like forging of documents, and
fooling officials with those documents, playing a visesman who
acts according to his psychological tricks. (C 4,36,37,579, D 6.)


-35-
This love of excitement was not strong enough, just as was
not the political motivation, to bring him to more dangerous,
and more demanding acts. (C 4, 8; E 2.)
Besides, this longing for exicitements has a decreased with
the age. when during the school age he did not care what his
parents felt when he was being thrown out of all schools, when
he was not a man who was not a man who was not a man who
and when in 1939 he was bold enough to volunteer to the Foreign
legion, then, in later years, he is not so bold any longer, as
mentioned before, and he is held back by the thought of his
mother and his wife is feelings. (E 5, 10.) He even needs the
young lady who had been always always and, concession to get over the
restraining influence of his wife.
During the debriefing, although he was left in full freedom
to tell his story, to feel, to live it once more; he did not
be able to get people as if telling the story of an other
person, leaving the impression of a man weary of his turbulent
past, possibly longing for the family ( he mentioned having
not seen his wife since 1950).
3. Lack of initiative.
His troubles in the schools seem having started when he
got acquainted with Jean ADAM whose plans he followed, although
he "was sure that he could have made better plans". ( B 11.)
In Germany he had PASCAL who did not like the jobs, spoke
of leaving those, whereupon"they"then decided to flee. (C 6,22.)
Later Jean ADAM is back again with his bad ideas and in-
tentions, even blackmailing David into action. ( E 5, 11.)
4. Lack of planning.
He often acts under the effect of a momentary thought,
without planning, or he changes the plans if there were any.
Sometimes those acts or changes are just ridiculous, and
show how bad was the "planning" itself. ( C 26, 30,34.)
Thereby he neglects the necessary security precautions,
and takes unnecessary risks. (C 10, 13, 16, 17, 77, 78, 81, 84,
87, E 1.)
Sometimes, when his "plan" does not work, he gets lost and
remains inactive, lets things go their own way. (C 15.)


-36-
H. : RELIABILITY OF THE STORY.
1. His story gets unbelievable because too often:
a/ he has "good luck" which helps him (C 15,16,27,30,78,ao.)
b/ his opponent is stupidly derelict, which enables David always
to come out a winner, to escape the danger of being captured.
( C 10,23,23,29,36,37,44,45,52,56,77.3
2. There are statements in his story which are not well
believable, 1.1.3
- that he and Pascal got leave- or travel-documents from the
Police in Stettin without having had any leave certificate from
the factory; or that he, having been only for a few months in
Germany, knew the language well enough and could prepare forged
leave certificates for himself and Pascal. (C 7.)
- that he does not remember where he did live in Berlin when
employed as a photographer, when this place was searched. (C 18)
- that "Passports for Foreigners" were issued by German au-
thorities so easily, without any checks, on so limited purpose
as was theirs: only for a short leave in Paris. (C 25, 29.)
- His tutoring of Pascalconcerning the map:this was not necessary
at all, because it really was hAa,David, who bought the map,
Pascal could not have stated wrongly. ( C 28.)
- that he was allowed to go from the NS&K penal camp to Police
14; that the Police engaged him without any investigation of
his past; that the NS&K penal camp released him simply on the
basis of a note that he had registered for work with the Police.
- that he, at this time, knew the trick with the combination of
a false and a true document, ( C 57.) and -
- that the higher an officer, the easier is to fool him (D 6),
- that one has to use the "lack of link" between different
authorities: to present a/forged)document of one authority
to an officer of an other authority, who would not find
the forging. (This was mentioned in connection with D 6.)
- that the officer in OXW AEM gave him the top-secret location
of the installation without having asked for the purpose of
his visit. ( C 77.)
- that he was so security conscious and did not meet the patrons
in his living place, that the "Belgian girl", Allumes and oth-
ers had not been to this place before. (C 80,81,82.)
- that he had ordered through Allou forged letter-forms
of different offices by thousands of copies. ( 60).

J. SECURITY RISK.
1.
Whether the story is right or invented, or "beautiful",
there are points in it which indicate to some security risks
connected with this person:
2.
- His father, sister, her husband, and probably their children
are in the USSR, whereto they repatriated from France in 1948. (A3)
3.
- Als father, although a theoretical "pretender to the Throne
of Georgia" is in so good relation with, and so well trusted by,
the communists government of the USSR and of Soviet Georgia,
that he is allowed to live permanently ( over 10 years) in
Hirlis,
Georgia. (A 3.)
18. - His. cousin Mathee Keresseidize who was sent by the Ger-
mans as a spy to USSR, was caught there, and sentenced to 15 years
in prison or hard labor; was later free to come to Moscow and to
repatriate to France. (A 7.)
5. - His sister Helen, after she reprinted, was used by the
communists as a beacher changes in Georgia. Then, convicted
for insulting talk about the Stalin, and sentenced to 5 years in a
1948. (A 3.) The most later vindicated, received retroactively
the salary for those five years, was allowed to come back to
Tiflis, was occasionally at the same time in Moscow when Math√©e
was there, and they,occasionally, met there. (A 5.)
6. - Helen's husband Irazki1 Lgrdkipanidze, a former German SD
man, repatriated to USSR together with his wife. (See p.l above.)
However, Nath√© shall allegedly having heard nothing about his
fache when he met Helen in Moscow. (A 7.)
7.
Such things happen sometimes, but they are far from belon-
ging to everyday s pattern in Soviet life. The concentration of
all those happenings on a very limited circle of David's relatives
could hardly be occasional. This should have special reasons.
8.
The question arises: If this concentration is not occasio-
nal, then - what is its purpose or reason, and how much is David
involved?
9.
Concerning David himself:
a/ According to this story he has acted in so many cases im-
prudently, just relaying on his "good luck" only, and the stupi-
dity of his opponents, that this could have developed into a
habit of his.
b/ He has spoken of having been very cautious and security
minded when taking people to his living place (that only two
friends have been there), and when meeting people. (C 8c.)
Eut

But he, probably has not thought of how dangerous it was for
him to re-registered two times in Farris under his right name for
the 19th century, the primary after he had abandoned there two working
places. for has he thought how dangerous it was for him to visit
his parents or those occasions in Farris, a case of a "good sense" that
which he might have been wanted, until these addresses probably,
were re-prietered as his home addresses when he applied for work
in Germany.
c/ David has shown during the debriefing broad knowledge of
different advantages and tactics of clandestine work,
and the "relaxying used: If believing his story, then the
question arises where could he have learned all this knowledge
at that early time, before 1944?
d/ The incident of having instructed Pascal through the cellar
wall what to. say during the interrogation about the map, with no
other items mentioned on what more he had instructed Pascal at
the same occasion, makes one think that this part of the story
is invented. It looks that David had been told of the
coordination of testimonies, that he had not quite understood
that the story is a "good sense" or a "glipgreen", was telling
nonsense. ( 2 28 and H 2 related item.)
e/ David's acclaimed broad knowledge of different "psychologi-
cal" tricks on one side, and on the other side his unwittingly
demonstrated lack of understanding of many basic principles of
clandestine work, leave the impression that David has been
most of those clever things a f t e r he had used to be primitive
knowledge during will, and is simply trying to impress us by
telling "clever" ( 3 28, 16). Would be in line with his need
of understanding? ( 3 28, 16).
e/ This could be true if he still is a "honest" crook, and
the story is right in its main lines.
However, the too tight concentration of events different infor-
mation and'alleged knowledge in this story, together with the
unexcited,unpartial way of telling the exciting story by David,
give also reason to think that the story is a "too good" cover-
story of a penetration agent.
10. What could happen when David, being taken for a "honest
crook", would be used in a clandestine operation?
a/ Due to his general instability and the trend to act under the
effect of soce cencetary thought, he might easily deviate of the
pre-arranged, secure plan of action, and may fall into difficul-
ties through his irrational steps.
b/ Due to the lack of solid, binding motivation, and the trend
to use his own "cleverness", he may "somehow" come to the splendid
idea of contracting the "other side" and carry out the assignment


-39-
in his own, a better, perhaps less straining; easier way.
In his eyes, this does not need to be urhonest; because the
boss knows that he is a crock, a honest, but clever one,
a/ If this analysis is right, then this hypothetical care of
'honest" David is moving along the road of a wise man's work
which David likes to go: not too dangerous and straining psy-
sically, however, well exciting.
d/ If, however, David is a double agent, then he would not need
any of the fourd traits in his past activity and his way to
the other side is simple, provided that he will not be detected
here before.
K. SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS.
To avoid possible errors, the following steps are suggested:
1. A cross-check of all debriefing reports and other informa-
tion available on David.
2. Drafting a list of additional fact-finding and control ques-
tions.
3. Asking these questions under simultaneous application of
consealed tape recording, thus providing an opportunity for
detailed study of the answers and reactions of David.
4. Secret checks on persons mentioned in David's story; espe-
cially on Math√©e Keresseidize.
5. Secret checks with the French authorities on the last 10
years off David's whereabouts, activities and contacts, in-
cluding the time in jails.

L. PERSONAL IMPRESSION
MADE BY DAVID ON THE DEBRIEPER.
1.
Soon after the second session of the debriefing, on 29 Apr.
the debriefer was asked by the assigner whether the third David
if he were in the situation of an agent to go together with David
on a clandestine operation, replied:
NO, there is no rely on this man.
2.
This reply stands at this day of closing of this report?
a/
it is dangerous to go with him; even if warned that he is
or might be a double-agent and when,thus, prepared for the
resulting special dangers
- he may add many more, unpredictable dangers by his irra-
tional, flash-of-thought actions.
b/
it is still more dangerous to go with him if knowing his
weaknesses, however taking on for a "honest" crook. No
matter whether he is not a subordinate, one can not rely
on his adherence to the prepared plan and given orders.
c/ It is suicidal unwittingly, of course) for a person who
would be sent with him without being informed of his weak-
nesses, in all trust of his knowledge; experience, ratio-
nality and other necessary qualities which he does not have
3.
Despite of this rather negative impression, it must be
said that David could still prove to be a satisfactory performer,
and an acceptable calculated risk on many one-man special op√©-
rations, that especially in view of the rather general shortage
of "excellent" stock ofycandidates.
