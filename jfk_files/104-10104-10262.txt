Per our conversation in the environs of the DD/ P' s office on 19 December, we have just received from[ London] St a-  tion a. scrap of information on Subject' s activities. [ MI- 5,  the British) Security Service, has provided the following in a report on Americans who are in correspondence with the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation:  " Jim Garrison, District Attorney, Orleans,  Louisiana A secret and reliable source has reported that the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation has been in touch with Jim Garrison. Our source states that the in i-  ti at ive in this contact appears to have come from the Foundation and the purpose of it seems to be to persuade Garrison to write an article about the late President Kennedy' s assassination which pre-  sumably the Foundation could use in some way. "  24 2. [ MI- 5 has also passed this information to the Legal 24 Attache( FBI representative) in London.
