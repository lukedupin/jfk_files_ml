TO PRESENT THE SPEECH WHICH IS SUMMARIZED BELOW.)
2. VON THADDEN BEGINS BY TRACING THE HISTORY OF
THE UNITED STATES' RELATIONSHIP WITH GERMANY FROM WORLD
WAR I TO THE PRESENT, DEVOTING CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO
THE 1929 STOCK MARKET CRASH. HE GIVES CREDIT TO THE
UNITED STATES FOR HELPING EUROPE BACK ON ITS FEET AFTER
WORLD WAR II THROUGH THE MARSHALL PLAN. BUT POINTS OUT
THAT THE NATIONS WHICH WERE HELPED USED THE AID TO BUILD
AN EXPORT BASE WHICH NOW IS CONTRIBUTING TO AMERICA'S
FINANCIAL TROUBLES. HE SAYS THAT GERMANY AND OTHER
COUNTRIES BECAME INFECTED WITH AN "EXPORT INTERTIA"
AFTER THE WAR WHICH HAD SHORT TERM BENEFITS FOR WORLD
TRADE; BUT WHICH IN THE LONG RUN DAMAGED THE DOMESTIC
ECONOMIES OF THE EXPORTING COUNTRIES.
3. THE 15 AUGUST 1971 SPEECH BY PRESIDENT NIXON IS
COMPARED WITH THE 24 OCTOBER 1929 STOCK MARKET CRASH,
AND VON THADDEN SAYS THAT THE SPEECH WILL HAVE JUST AS
PROFOUND AN EFFECT ON THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL SYSTEM AS DID
THE CRASH. HE DEPCTS THE SPEECH AND THE RESULTING CONTROLS

4. IN HIS ANALYSIS OF THE TYPE OF WORLD ECONOMIC
SYSTEM WHICH SHOULD FOLLOW THE CURRENT AMERICAN CONTROLS
AND FLOATING OF THE DOLLAR, VON THADDEN DRAWS HEAVILY FROM
THE 23 SEPTEMBER PRESS CONFERENCE OF FRENCH PRESIDENT POMPIOU.
HE SAYS THAT THE DOLLAR CAN NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED THE
SINGLE WORLD CURRENCY. THE PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY OF EUROPE
MAKES IT NECESSARY THAT A EUROPEAN RESERVE CURRENCY BE
AVAILABLE AS A SECOND WORLD CURRENCY. THIS CANNOT BE
THE BRITISH POUND AS MANY PEOPLE AT ONE TIME WOULD HAVE
BELIEVED, BUT MUST BE A CURRENCY ACCEPTED BY BOTH FRANCE
AND GERMANY AND ADMINISTERED BY A COMMON GERMAN-FRENCH
BANK SUPPORTED BY GOLD. ALL EUROPEAN STATES WOULD USE
THIS BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS.
VON THADDEN VIEWS POMPIOU'S SPEECH AS A SIGNAL TO THE
UNITED STATES THAT THE FRENCH ARE NOT WILLING TO STAY
PERMANENTLY UNDER ECONOMIC PRESSURE FROM WASHINGTON, AND
AS PROVIDING AN OUTLINE OF THE TYPE OF ECONOMIC ORDER
EUROPE SHOULD HAVE IN THE FUTURE. HE CRITICIZES THE WEST
GERMAN GOVERNMENT FOR NOT TAKING A SIMILAR STAND, SAYING
5
THAT WHEN IT IS POSSIBLE FOR ONE STATE TO PUT ECONOMIC
4
PRESSURE ON OTHER STATES, THE SITUATION CAN LEAD TO

POLITICAL AND MILITARY PRESSURES WHICH WOULD BE PROFITABLE
ONLY TO THE COMMUNISTS.
5. VON THADDEN SEES TWO ALTERNATIVES IN THE PRESENT
SITUATION, I.E., EITHER A RETURN TO FIRN PARITY WITH A
DEVALUED DOLLAR, OR A CHANGE TO FLEXIBLE EXCHANGE RATES
AGREED TO BY THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES AND GUARANTEED BY
INDIVIDUAL CURRENCIES. HE BELIEVES THE DOLLAR MUST BE
DEVALUED BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES CANNOT EXPECT FURFOFANS-
TO CONTINUE TO BUY THE DOLLAR AT A RATE WHICH IS NOT
LEGALLY FIXED. HE VIEWS FLEXIBLE EXCHANGE RATES AS
DESIRABLE FOR EUROPE, BUT NOT REALIZABLE AT PRESENT
BECAUSE THIS SYSTEM WOULD EXCLUDE THE "THIRD WORLD"
AND THUS WOULD BE OPPOSED BY THE UNITED STATES.
6. SUMMARIZING, VON THADDEN STRESSES THE NECESSITY
FOR THE FREE WORLD TO REMAIN STRONG AND FOR EACH EUROPEAN
COUNTRY TO RETAIN ITS NATIONAL CHARACTER AND DIGNITY TO
PREVENT DOMINATION BY COMMUNIST AND FAR-LEFT FORCES. HE
CRITICIZES THOSE WHO SAY THAT AMERICA IS NO LONGER NEEDED
AS A COUNTERWEIGHT TO THE USSR. DECLARING THAT THERE IS
5
NO OTHER COUNTRY WHICH CAN SERVE IN THIS CAPACITY. ESPECIALLY
4
5
NOT PRESENT DAY WEST GERMANY. HE SAYS THAT THE WEST

GEMAN PEOPLE, THROUGH COMMUNIST INFLUENCE AND LEADERS
WHO ARE FRIENDLY TO CONNUNISM, HAVE LOST THEIR NATIONAL
CHARACTER AND ARE TOO WEAN TO OPPOSE THE USSR. HE ENDS
BY CALLING FOR A CHARACTER REAISSANCE IN THE FREE WORLD
TO MAKE IT STRONG ENOUGH TO COUNTER COMMUNISM. (HEADQUARTERS
COMMENT: THE STATEMENT OF VON THADDEN IN SPOKANE MAY
ATTRACT PRESS INTEREST DUE TO THE NOTORIETY HE GAINED IN
RECENT YEARS AS LEADER OF A GERMAN NATIONALIST PARTY
WIDELY DESCRIBED AS NEO-NAZI. IN FACT, THE PARTY HAS
DECLINED IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC TO THE POINT WHERE IT
IS THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION, AND VON THADDEN'S RECENT
RESIGNATION FROM THE PARTY PEPRIVES HIM OF ANY POLITICAL
PLATFORM IN WEST GERMANY.)

3. (Source Comment: Von Thadden's resignation
will in all frombility mean the end of the NPD as an
effective political organization. With the possible
exception of the Bavarian District Chairman of the NPD,
the NPD has been the most important objective
and dynamic leaders. Pochimann, however, has health
problems and also does not have the stature of Von Thadden.
The disintegration of the NPD will probably result in a
number of smaller right-wing groups coming into existence,
which is a major role in the NPD. The NPD is
have a propensity for violence. After the NPD disin-
tegrates most of its former supporters will probably
cast their votes for one of the three major political
parties in West Germany. The CDU and CSU stand to gain
most of these votes.)

2. In June 1983, the West German Interior Ministry prepared
a 50-page study of the prospects for banning the NPD entitled
"Considerations Regarding a Ban of the National Democratic Party,
The study was well prepared and carefully written. It is still
considered the basic Interior Ministry paper on the NPD and is
being studied by senior officials of both the federal and state
regional government. The National Democratic Party, the pro-
taining a court decision against the NPD, but from the content of
the study; it is clear that the authors believed that the courts
would probably reject a government proposal to ban the NPD,
(Field Comment: If the study is still considered current, it is
unclear how it fits with-Benda's November 1988 statement that there
was sufficient evidence to obtain a ban against the NPD.)
3. The study summarized the case which could be brought
against the NPD as follows:
a. It could be shown that there was a similarity
between the NPD and the National Socialist German Workers
Party (NSDAP) which has been outlawed.
b. It could be argued that the goals, and parts of
the party platform, of the NPD are contrary to the prin-
ciples of a free democratic state.
The study concludes that a sufficiently strong case could be pre-
sented to prevent the case being thrown out by the courts without
a hearing.
4. The study lists the following points which the NPD could
be expected to use in its defense:
a. The party could prove that it has given firm instruc-
tions to its members not to engage in rowdysm or violencay
b.
It could show that a sizeable number of former
NSDAP members have been forced out of the party as part
of the Selbstreinigung (self-cleaning) process.
c. It could point out many features of its program
which are in accord with democratic principles.
d. It could show that its elected representatives
have worked with other parties and have not disrupted the
Landage (state diets) and other elected bodies in which
they participate.
e. It could point out that other political parties
have many ex-Nazis and ex-communists as members and could
claim that the majority of the 28,000 NPD members are not
opposed to the concept of the Federal Republic.
f. It would charge that the government's charges were
one-third, unfairly presented, and out of date.
g. It would claim that not all of Professor Ernst
A n r 1 c h's points were included in the party plat-
form. (Field Comment: Anrich is a former university
professor from Darmstadt whose proposals were apparently more
extreme than those incorporated in the party platform.)
h. It could claim that the increased violence
(Verrohung) of the political climate in West Germany is
the fault of the New Left and not of the NPD.

5. The study states that it would be very difficult to re-
fute these NPD defenses in court. The government would have to
admit that since early 1968 there have been very few statements
made by NPD leaders, or incideits caused by the NPD, which could
be used to support the government's case. Objectively, it would
have to be admitted that many incidents of violence in which the
NPD has been involved were initiated by opponents of the party.
6. The study predicts the following probable results should
the government win its case against the NPD:
a. The NPD would probably respect the prohibition.
It is very unlikely that the NPD would attempt to go under-
ground as the illegal Comunist Party of Germany (KPD) did,
b. NPD members and sympathizers would not change their
opinions because of a ban. Many would join other groups
or parties and continue to work for their political beliefs.
c. NPD and rightist sympathizers would begin a cam-
paign for the banning of the new German Communist Party
(DKP) and other leftist groups.
d. A ban of the NPD would be well received in foreign
countries.
7. The study concludes that if the government should lose a
case against the NPD, it would be the result of the lack of valid
evidence (Beweisschwierigkeiten). In such an event, the following
adverse effects would occur:
a. The NPD would receive a new impetus and valuable
publicity.
b. The policy of Selbstreinigung which has had some
success in keeping former Nazis out of key positions would
be halted.
c. Many middle-class persons who sympathize with the
NPD, but who have refrained from open support because of
the stigma of being associated with a party which could be
declared illegal, would join the party or become active
supporters.
d. The party would undoubtedly attract more members.
(Field Comment: The NPD leadership is known to be worried
because the party's membership has not increased signifi-
cantly during the past 18 months.)

REF: 1661-1559, dated 9 September 1969
1. We are very pleased with the quinily of the informa-
tion on the NDD which has been made available through CATERION,
It is particularly useful during this pre-ecction period, but
we also appreciate not having to wait to 8 weeks for CAMISSPER
to digest the material and pass it on.
2. After looking over the Reference, we are inclined
to stick with the requirements mentioned in DIRECTOR 39264 for
items worthy of intel dissemination. In this context Bonn
State Department Tolegram 12253 dated 17 September quotes
Forcign Minister Brandt as saying that there has been evidence
that the Commission's current report is not a possible fact that
given financial support to von Thadden. While we are inclined
to think that Brandt's comment may be wishful thinking,
evidence of East German financing for the NID would be of great
interest and utility. Material not bearing on the requirements
of the CERION 39264 should be forwarded now to Headquarters for
reimbursement on 38 years you know, is a subject of interest beyond
its proportions as a political force, and we are grateful for
the timely opportunity to keep up with the ins and outs of it.

Intercepted communications, supplemented by information from a
member of the West Berlin National Democratic Party (NPD) with
close contacts among members of the Berlin NPD Executive Council
and a record of accurate reporting.
Summary: The Berlin NPD has been plagued by a split between the
BETTIN/City lendership, which is long! to the Party's national leaders,
and the "loyalists" headed by the Berlin district leaders, who opposed
the dissolution of the Berlin NPD ordered by National Party Chairman
Adolf von Thadden in October 1968; Court action led to the thwarting
of the plan for dissolution. In an effort to keep the Berlin Party
in the 1968, the President's decision was passed by the President
tivities until after the September parliamentary elections. Subse-
quently, von Thadden arranged a postponement of a scheduled Berlin
Party convention until October, because of the possibility of a ban
on the issue of the United States. The President's decision was
militant left. At the end of March, Berlin City NPD Chief Rudolf
Kendzia resigned in an effort to promote party unity in Berlin, but
he remains active behind the scenes. Since early April, the Berlin
was a very successful and an important role in the development of
of the Loyalists has been greatly reduced, and in accordance with
von Thadden's instructions party activities have been circumspect.
Both the Berlin and the National leadership are hoping that the NPD
has been increasingly the most accurate as in September, which, they feel,
will make the party more accepting the U.S. Government's decision
and enhance NPD chances during the 1971 Berlin communal elections.
Berlin is planning to send volunteer workers to campaign for the NPD
in West Germany, especially in North Rhine-Westphalia, the NPD strong-
hold. End of Summary.

membership and others are dropping out quietly. In March the paid-up
membership was about 300.)
2. Following the abortive attempt by the National Democratic
Party (NPD) leadership to force the Berlin NPD to dissolve itself for
tactical reasons in October 1968, routine party activity resumed al-
most immediately. It was characterized by a split between the leader-
ship of the Berlin City (Landesverband) party unit and that of dis-
tending the development of the German and the British War. The
National Party Chairman Adolf von Thadden and the national leadership
in Hanover and their broader tactical concepts; while the latter, re-
ferred to as the "Loyalists" (Satzungstreu), defend the letter of the
Berlin NPD statutes. The Loyalists initially objected primarily to
the "Sterns" (Sterns) and the "Sterns" (Sterns) and "Sterns".
city Executive Committee (Landesvorstand) headed by Rudolf Kendzia
led to total mutual mistrust, disloyal statements to the press, and
efforts to get each other expelled from the party by a party court
(Schiedsgericht).
3. At a general membership meeting in Berlin wille March-1968,
you have been completed to achieve a twice within the party and ordered
that there be no "political organizational activity" until after the
September 1969 parliamentary elections. At this meeting von Thadden
approved the scheduling of a Berlin party convention (Landespartieting)
for 26 April 1969, at which a new and hopefully more stable city
Executive Committee was to be elected.
4. The 15 March meeting provided an indication that the Berlin
NPD was a member of the German Thadden's guidance until 1971,
in spite of the friction between city and district leadership, Al-
though the eight spokesmen for the local leadership, who took the
floor after
Kendzia's situation report and von Thadden's keynote
meeting, was a member of the German Thadden's executive
the self-dissolution of the local party, and no one contradicted them,
all but 31 of the 140 members present then voted for a resolution con-
demning District Chiefs Johann Ratzek (Schneenberg) and Philip
Goeiles (Wilmersdorf), leaders of the Loyalists, for anti-party ac-
tions of the National carefully elected leader of the National Party of
the Berlin City leadership, and according to members present was due
solely to von Thadden's presence and influence. In the view of these
members, a meeting without the attendance of representatives of the
Hanover headquarters would have led to a no-confidence vote in the
Kendzia's office. The remaining the meeting, von Thadden also rejected
Kendzia's "Berlin Program" and called for a softer line on East
Germany and on German reunification.
5. At the 15 March session, left-wing, anti-NPD protestors
assaulted a number of NPD members and forced the NPD twice to change
its meeting site. This leftist action and the obvious fact that the
militant left has a penetration of the Berlin SPD have had a seri-
ous ability to be the most important. The most important of the
The party is now tentatively planning to hold future meetings on a
rented excursion boat whose location would not be announced until the
time of the meeting.
6. The Berlin NPD has made strenuous efforts to determine which
left-wing organizations made up the task force which tried to disrupt
the National Party of the Extrapolarmentary Opposition (APO) claimed
the honor, but the NPD investigation showed definitely that all but a
handful of the protestors were an organized group dispatched by the
Spandau branch of the West Berlin Socialist Unity Party (SEW) whose
actions are part of a long-range program of harassment by the East
Berlin Socialist Unity Party (SED).
7. Because of the subsequent possible threats of prohibition
by the Allies (signalling letter from Governing Mayor Klaus
Schrubel) and the Advertising during that the NPD in Berlin be banned) and of
further counter-considerations by the militant left, on 27 March

von Thadden wrote a letter to the Berlin City leadership asking that

the Berlin party convention be postponed until October 1969, the
normal expiration date of the term of the present city Executive
Committee and well after the national elections. The letter, which
was read at several district meetings, also stipulated that the city
and district organizations were to restrict themselves to routine
monthly meetings with no speeches and no invited guests until next
October.
8. In a tactical move to promote party unity, Party Chief
Kendzia resigned on 28 March. In response to von Thadden's letter,
the Berlin district prue unit leadership, which otherwise remained
intact, called a session of the Berlin Party Council (Landesnusschuss)
(1969) and the 10 April meeting of the 10 April meeting of the
(Field Comment: The Party Council consists of the Executive Committee
Plus. the 12 district leaders.) Walter Seczen, a member of the na-
tional leadership, was present. The situation was ticklish because
the Berlin NPD statutes provide that if full membership meetings in
the 10 April meeting, the 10 April meeting was the party conven-
tion in April, the postponement motion would fail; the 10 April meeting
tinct danger that this could occur. At the 10 April meeting, the
district leaders grumbled but approved the postponement until
11 October.
10. Kendzia's resignation, Guenther Mensel, a member of the
Executive Committee, was selected as Acting Pe. thy Chief and Speaker
of the Party Council until a new Executive Committee is elected. In
October. Mensel, an attorney, was hesitant about accepting the job
because of its possible effect on his practice, and did not commit
himse If until the 10 April executive meeting. Mensel's age (62) and
the 10 April meeting was the party committee. He was a member of
replacement considered was Guenter Kleinert, also on the Executive
Committee, whom Kendzia did not trust. Mensel's duties are to con-
sist of calling and chairing pro-forma monthly Executive Committee
meetings and of presiding at the party congress next October.
10. Kendzia considers his resignation a temporary tactical re-
treat caused by disagreements with the NPD national and Berlin dis-
trict leaders, by von Thadden's public rejection of his "Berlin
Party" and the 10 April meeting. He was a member of a
hit-and-run car accident involving a bicyclist on 27 March, Kendzia
promised Mensel to remain active behind the scenes and set up a
vacant office in his place of business as party headquarters, with
decks for himself and Executive Committee members Frank Schwerdt,
Jochchim Rebuschat and Hans Werner Andrews, the de facto heads of the
Berlin Party.
11. Kendzia and a majority of the NPD leaders hope that the fall
elections will bring some 25 to 35 NPD members into the Bundestag.
This, they feel, will make the party more acceptable to potential
right-wing voters in Berlin and thus enable the NPD to make a showing
the 10 April meeting. He was a member of the 10 April meeting
NPD's major problem in Berlin is to keep its membership intact and
its machinery functioning until 1971. Whether Kendzia will hold to
his promise to direct the Berlin NPD from behind the scenes indefi-
ciently, the 10 April meeting was the party concern about the
tions, because Kendzia has shown an interest in the current program
and policies of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) and particularly in
its "General-Contract" concept, which fits in with his "Berlin
Program." A close friend of Kendzia's, (fnu) Nerchert, resigned from
the NPD to protest its participation in the presidential election in
Berlin and the 10 April meeting. He was a member of the 10 April
meeting.
12. Since Kendzia's resignation and the 10 April executive meet-
ing, the Berlin City Executive Committee (under Kendzia's behind-the-
scenes tutelage) has kept the Berlin NPD functioning and loyal to the
Hanover leadership. Executive Committee members (especially Schwerdt,
Rebuschat and Andreas) have attended annual election meetings in all
12 party-districts. Through their influence, pro-von Thadden or

duced. Although there is now no significant internal opposition

under the watchful eye of the pro-tem Executive Committee, until
next October when the party convention of the Berlin NPD will elect
a new leadership.
13. Schuetz attempts to have the NPD banned in Berlin have
not been taken periodically. Local party activists are preparing to
support the NPD election campaign in West Germany by sending volun-
teer workers. A letter appealing for such help states that the de-
cisive. electoral campaign which will determine whether or not the
NPD gets into the Bandesting will be waged in North Rhine-Westphalia,
the country has been the most important role in the National
teers who are to distribute leaflets, put up posters and ring door-
bells. (Field Comment: The NPD made inroads in North Rhine-
Westphalia during the economic recession of 1965-66, and the NPD
national leadership is counting heavily on salvaging their foothold
in the Bielefeld-Wood.
14. NPD weons in the national election campaign are
to be pamphlets describing the party's election platform. One is
to be distributed beween 1 and 15 June; a follow-up pamphlet, be-
tween 15 and 30 August; and a third pamphlet on the eve of the elec-
tion. Each will be printed in 15,000,000 copies. Distribution will
be handled by two firms--Velbringer Company and Erdmann Company.
15. Ruediger Krauss, head of the NPD's student organization,
the National University League (Nationalier Hochschulbund - NHB),
and the National University of the National University of the
Bonn City NPD Executive Committee. Von Thadden plans to use the
tactic of moving reliable leaders into critical areas after the
elections. For example, he plans to move a Bavarian NPD officer to
Berlin and assume the chairmanship of the Berlin NPD. In an attempt
to obtain legal recognition for the NHB in Berlin, (Fru) von Hindy,
a Huagarian law student and good friend of Krauss, is to be ap-
pointed Krauss' successor.

West German Ministry of Interior
Evaluation of the Prospects of
Banning the National Democratic
Party
Germany (1 September 1969)
OGA-913
A medius-level Kent German government official who follows
the activities of the National Democratic Party and who had
access to the study during his official duties. The infor-
mation was extracted from the original document and is be-
lieved to be an accurate summary of its highlights.
Sensory: In June 1968, the West German Ministry of the Interior
prepared a basic study of the prospects of banning the West German
National Democratic Party (NPD). The summary of this study given
below describes the major charges which the government could bring
against the NPD, the defenses the NPD could be expected to make
a new strategy to the National Trade Commission. The National
would follow both a successful and an unsuccessful case against the
NPD. According to the source, this study is still considered the
basic Interior Ministry evaluation of the case against the NPD and
is being studied by senior federal government and state (land)
officials. End of Summary.
1. (Field Document: For several years, West German political
and government leaders have debated sceking a constitutional court
ban on the NPD. Cu 13 November 1988, Eruot B e n d n, West German

that there was sufficient evidence to warrant bringing a suit against
the NPD. Klesinger, however, opposed bringing a suit, and the sub-
ject became embroiled in West German politics. On 23 April 1969,
the Federal Cabinet decided not to seek a court ban of the NPD, at
least until after the September elections. This decision was
prompted by evidence that the NPD was making no membership gains
and apparently was losing popular support.)

5. The study states that it would be very difficult to re-
fute these NPD decreases to court. The government vould have to
adait that since early 1968 there have been very few statesuits
made by NPD leaders, or incidents caused by the NPD, which could
be used to support the government's case. Objective, it would
have to be admitted that many incidents of valence in which the
NPD has been invoived were initiated by apponente of the party.
6. The study predicts the following probable results should
the government vith its case against the NPD:
a. The NPD would probably respect the prohibition.
It is very unlikely that the NPD would attempt to go uader-
ground as the illegal Communist Party of Cermany (RPD) did.
b. NPD members and sympathizers would one change their
opinions because of a ban. Many would joa other groups
or parties and contimie to work for their political beliefs.
c. NPD and rightst sympathizers vould begin a cam-
paign for the banaing of the new Cerman Communist Party
(DKP) and other leftlint groups.
d. A ban of the NPD would be vell received in foreign
countries.
7. The study concludes that if the government should lose a
case against the NPD, it would be the result of the lack of valld
evidence (Beweischvorigkeiten). La such an event, the following
adversa afficts vould occur:
a. The NPD would receive a new inpetus and valuable
publicity.
b. The policy of Selbstreinigong which has had some
success in keeping former Nuzie out of iscy positions vould
be baited.
c. Many middle-class persons who syaphatize with the
but who have refrained from open support because of
the stigos of being associated wich a party which could be
declared illegal, would join the party or become active
supporters.
d. The party would undoubtedly attract more eabers.
(Field Comment: The NPD leadership is known to be worried
because the party's easlership has not increased signalit-
cantly during the past 15 months.)

orders contributed to the NP? gains, but this was
not as-decisive as some have supposed. Despite
the fact that, the NP is unlikely to achieve a
growth company, a stable to children and the
early 1930s.
The outcome of the Indian-Wuerttemberg confirmed
the problem of many socialists that their coopera-
tion with the CDU at both the national and state
level is proving to be unprofitable for the party.
As a result, they have already decided at the state

for the Bonn coalition appear less favorable.

Baden-Wuerttemberg: A Test Case
Baden and Wuerttemberg tra-
ditionally have been strongholds
of liberal, nonsocialist democ-
racy in Germany. In the early
1930s, the Nazi vote in this
area was almost always appreci-
SECRET
ably lower than elsewhere in
Germany. The hotbeds of Nazism
lay in other regions, for ex-
ample in Franconia, East Prussia,
and Germany.
The economic and social pic-
ture in Baden-Wuerttemberg would
lead to expectations of stability
there. The proportion of the
national government, the pro-
dustry is higher than in any
other state. The economy of the
national government, the pro-

Protestants and Catholics are
also evenly balanced in pop-
ulation of the country. The part of
protestants in the Federal Re-
public is slightly higher.
A few observers correctly
forecast the outcome, but the
voting of the country is the
vote for the National Democratic
Party would be lower than in
the 1960s. The 1969年 Gerg-
man polling organizations had
predicted in March that the NPD
would receive five percent of the
vote.
Federal-level politicians
had campaigned actively in the
state. Chancellor Kurt Kiesinger,
and the 1960s were the
three-day speaking tour, in which
he sharply attacked "arrogant,

theme in the Ihohenlohe area,
where the NPD later received its
highest vote in the state. Willy
Brandt also appeared to speak for
the Social Democrats.

Reaction to student rioting

failure of the C&D to react more
forcefully against the 1940s.
As was seen in the
early 1948, overwhelmingly
Catholic areas, where the Church
influences its members politi-
cally, had the lowest right ex-
tremist vote. One overwhelm-
ingly Protestant district,
Proudenstadt, also produced a

Pepson, who on the Vote
The overall picture appears
to be that while both the Chris-
tian Democrats and the Free Demo-
crats lost to the NPD, they gained
at the expense of the Socialists.
The House has been the most
apathy and incurred some loss to
both the NPD and Democratic left.

these conditions are now vir-
tually absent. The defeat in
the U.S. government, the U.S. apres,
work to discredit any real Nazi
manifestations. Moreover, the
fact that no other state will
have been the most important
1969 federal elections may help
to prevent a real bandwagon de-
velopment. It must be emphasized
that the NPD is still a small
party, if no longer a mere spin-
ter group.
The Coalition Problem
German observers tend to be
more worried about the effect of
the NPD showing on foreign opin-
ing. The U.S. government has
NPD strength itself, and their
greatest concern is over the pros-
pects for the grand coalition,
and the U.S. government has
A Baden-Wuerttemberg SPD conven-
tion voted on 18 May against con-
tinuing the coalition in Stuttgart,
and the U.S. government has
resigned. This would seem to
make the prospects for the Bonn
coalition less favorable.
At the same time, the FPD
approach is to be a major part

Bonn or Stuttgart. Dabendorf

state. State CDU leaders may,
however, prefer to call new elec-

formed. In this event, they
would appeal for an absolute ma-
jority from the voters. If they
got it and if the NPD vote de-
veloped, it will be encouraging,
But new elections might also have
a less favorable outcome.


If the 1969 federal election
follows the pattern of the 28-
April election, the same problems
will arise in Bonn. With this
kind of a breakdown of the vote,
the 1969 federal election can
not form a majority, and a re-
fusal on the part of both of
them to join the CDU means that
the 1969 federal election is
jority government either--unless
the CDU invites NPD collabora-
tion, which it is far from ready
to do.
A collapse of the grand
coalition in Bonn either before
or after 1969 and a return by
the SPD to opposition positions

parties 'tended to harden into

German politicians have tried to
break with this tradition and
the 1969 federal election, the
ciple. A failure of these of-
forts would have serious impli-
cations. If--as does not seem
to be a major role in the 1969
major parties were unable to
form a majority government, this
might lead to severe instability
and the discrediting of par-
liamentary government.
Bonn and Weimar
Many misleading analogies
have been drawn between the Bonn
and Weimar republics. One Weimar
precedent may help, however, to
"The absence of executive emergency powers is not of course without dangers. In a bitter parliamentary deadlock, an
illegal assumption of power, perhaps by estrogovernmental elements, might be the only way out.
If the 1969 federal election
explain why some observers view
the coalition problem seriously,
In March 1930, another grand
coalition with SPD participation
collapsed over the question of
the 1969 federal election, the
leading to the formation of a
conservative majority government
under Heinrich Bruening. Bruening
was a major role in the 1969
tionary Franz von Papen, who in
turn was followed first by a wire-
line, was a major role in the 1969
ther, and then by Adolf Hitler.
The worst aspect of the SPD with-
drawal was that it made the par-
liament ineffective and power-
less.
Once minority government was
embarked on, supported by presi-
dential prérogatives, there was
an important role in the 1969
except the will of Hindenburg by
then susceptible and old. The
Nazis ultimately came to power,
which was a major role in the 1969
the paralysis and impotence of the
constitutional system and through
intrigues in the presidential
protection of the 1969 prope-
cially Papen and Schleicher, who
thought they could "use" Nazi
mass support.
In contrast to the 30s,
the political powers now are
far weaker, and aside from all
the other factors inhibiting a
recurrence, the Weimar precedent
of the 1969 federal election
in Bonn. They are completely
committed personally to the pres-
ent coalition. A decision to
go into opposition is unlikely

Another possibility might

the extent to which the results
continue to be attributed to
student activities, this will
strengthen the demand for firm-
ness. Even before the election,
the U.S. has been given to
state headquarters, advising that
speakers should react "completely
hard" against student demonstra-
tions.
Although the antistudent re-
action does not seem to have been
as important a factor as some have
been given to the U.S. and
lence and provocation on the part
of the students, accompanied by
constant press attention, could
be made to the U.S. and the
ficial counteraction. This, in
turn, could bring more serious
problems to the U.S. and the
the support of other elements.
Some matters of student con-
cern have appeal for others. Thus
students and many trade unionists
are not in the U.S. and the
question is again being agitated.

use of force in the name of "or-

THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN WEST GERMANY
The poor showing of the ultranationalistic
National Democratic Party (NPD) in recent elections
in several West German states clearly disproves the
party's claim of providing an acceptable alternative
to the United States. The NPD's failure to maintain the major
parties. The NPD's failure to maintain the momentum
suggested by the successes scored in two state
elections last fall is directly attributable both
the United States. The NPD's failure to maintain
to voter preference for the Christian Democrats and
Socialists deriving from the image of vigor and
decisiveness imparted by their "grand coalition"
and the American government's "great deal" of
reversal in the fortunes of the Kiesinger government--
which is unlikely-it is doubtful that the NPD will
be any more successful than other fringe groups have
been in seeking to rally latent truth-radical senti-
gent in Germany and revive it as a dynamic political
force.
Election Setbacks
the NPD has claimed wide
attention both in Germany and
abroad to the U.S. and the U.S. in
to conclude that it was a force
to be reckoned with. Within two
and a half years of its founding
concerns, the NPD's failure to
elected representatives to the
legislatures in five of West
England, the NPD's government
West Berlin). In elections this
April the party was expected to
obtain close to 10 percent of
the U.S. in 1970, and the U.S. in
and 12 to 15 percent in Schleswig-
Holstein but actually won only
15 percent in which parliament

base bastion" of Lower Saxony,
the NPD's performance was simi-
larly unimpressive--7 percent
of the vote and 10 Landtag seats.
Emphasis by party leaders
on their success in gaining rep-
resentation in all the states
of the U.S. in 1970, and
during the past year has not
masked their disappointment that
the U.S. in 1970, and the U.S.
leveled off. The party's failure
to make a good showing in
Schleswig-Holstein and Lower
NPD's failure to maintain the
larly susceptible to nationalist
appeals-is especially damaging,
and raises fundamental doubt
about the party's future pros-
pects.

Origins and Early Successes
Formed from the remnants of

which have dictated the
landscape of postwar Germany-the
NPD quickly established a polit-

The new party soon distinguished
itself by its relative success
and the importance of the her
ultranationalistic elements and a
variety of political malcontents.
In the past, the group of the

tions in 1951, was unable to
understand the general-
tions with rival rightist groups
before it was outlawed by the
West German supreme court in
1952.
During its first year, the
NPD encountered many of the prob-
lems experienced by its predeces-
sors. The party was unable to put
on an effective campaign for the
concern of the problem of the
and obtained only 2 percent of
the votes--short of the 5-percent
minimum required for representa-
tion in the Bundestag. In local

doubled its vote as compared with

NPD organizations to report and counteract their influence

been the most important role in the development of the
in Cologne, which is sponsored by the German equivalent of
the U.S. National Association of Manufacturers. The BfV
used as an argument with the industrialists the fact that
increasing influence of the NPD in German industry would
have in negative effects on the number of workers.
7.
The BfV survey of the election results at the
village and county level in Land Resse. This survey showed
that the NPD had substantial success in areas containing
German military installations. It was further determined
that the NPD had considerable appeal among non-commissioned
professional soldiers who feel they have failed to find
the most important role in the development of the NPD and
attitude has been less among Bundeswehr officers and draftees
than among non-commissioned officers, who feel themselves under-
paid and lacking in social acceptance. The BfV has contacted
the security organizations of the Bundeswehr to under-
take a program of orientation to counter the influence of
the NPD within the Bundeswehr.
Headquarters Comment: CS-311/16288-66 from a different
source reported that the President of the West German
Association of Military Reservists had stated that a
number of change of older reserve officers and non-
commissioned officers had voted for the NPD in the land
Hesse election.
