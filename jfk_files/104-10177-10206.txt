First Assistant U.S. Attorney
Western District of Pennsylvania
633 U.S. Post Office and Courthouse
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219
Dear Mr. Curry:
Re: Joseph Raymond Merola
In response to your letter of March 10, 1977 I wish to advise you
that the Central Intelligence Agency had one meeting with Joseph Raymond
Merola prior to August 1961. In late 1960 Joseph Raymond Merola made
several telephone calls to a CIA office offering his assistance in a general
way in connection with Cuban matters, which was refused. However, on
6 February 1961 Merola claimed to have information on a Latin American
senator who was a "close friend and confidant" of "Che" Gupvera. Since
Guevera was listed as being the subject of foreign intelligence requirements,
the CIA especially was not used with Mr. Merola. The meeting took place on
a February 1961 and is the only meeting with Merola prior to his incarceration
which was stated in your letter of March 1961.
Mr. Merola was not employed in the 1961 Intelligence Agency. His
contact with the CIA could not be described as an undercover Government
informat as alleged in the Writs of Error Coram Nichols by Victor Carlicet,
and Daniel Hanna. This one contact on 6 February 1961 by Merola with the
CIA was voluntary on his part.
Mathew McVane, an employee of the CIA, did testify in San Diego in
November 1975 concerning CIA contacts with Joseph Raymond Merola. The
citation we have for that case is U.S. v. Daton C. Smith, et al. in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, No. 74-2277-CIT.


14/00/00
The testimony given in that trial is not inconsistent with the response given
above. It is true that after Merola was released from prison be again
volunteered information to the CIA. Merola was a voluntary source of foreign
intelligence.
I hope this provides sufficient information for you to file your response.
If not, please call me at (AC 703) 351-7531.
Sincerely,
John K. Greaney

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. John K. Greancy
Special Assistant to the
General Counsel
FROM
:
Maurice A. Sovern
0/SA/DO/0
SUBJECT
:
Joseph R. Merola
REFERENCE
:
Assistant United States Attorney,
Pennsylvania Letter, 10 March 1977,
Subject as Above
1. The question in reference is the nature of
any involvement of Merola with CIA prior to
August 1961.
2. The Directorate's first recorded contact
with Joseph Raymond Merola prior to August 1961
occurred on 6 February 1961. It followed a series
of telephone calls over a period of several months
(late 1960) in early 1961. The meeting was
conducted in early 1961 offering his assistance in
connection with Cuban matters. Our officer had
declined contact until 6 February when Merola
claimed to have information on a Latin American
U.S. Government. Mr. Merola was a member of
of "Che" Guevera. Because Guevera was the proper
subject of foreign positive intelligence collection
requirement our officer agreed to a meeting.
3. The last recorded contact, except for the
litigation outlined below, with Merola was a tele-
phone contact with Merola in late July 1975 when
he volunteered additional foreign positive intel-
ligence.
4. At the end of August 1975, Merola
contact staff officer to ask for testimony in
the criminal fraud trial in San Diego, California
(U.S. Joseph R. Merola, et al, Southern District
of California, CR 74-2277-01) which we subsequently
E2 INPDT
CL BY 012360

FOR CIA OFFICIALS ONLY
provided on 13 November 1975.
5. Subject is characterized as a voluntary
occasional source of foreign positive intelligence
who was in sporadic contact with us.
6. We greatly appreciate the Assistant United
States Attorney's concern for the confidentiality
of our information. The information above may be
made available to the AUSA and the court as
appropriate without further restriction.

SUBJECT: Court Appearance on 13 November 1975, San Diego, California
1.
On 13 November 1975, that Native operated as a witness for the
defense at the United States District Court for the Southern District of
California, 325 West F Street, San Diego, California. The case was the
United States of America V. Dalton C. Smith, et al. MacVane was called
to testify by E. Mac Anos Jr., attorney for defendant Joe Zerola. In
honor of the subcona MacVane appeared at the court. On 13 November 1975
as approximately 15:30 hours San Diego time MacVane was called to the
vitness stand.
2. Mac Aros, attorney for defendant Joe Motala began questioning
after the 1975 Civil War. The case was based on the New York City
had-been employed by the CLA? Ee asked if MacVane knew defendant Merala?
He-asked if McZatne were told by Merala about a shipment of surplus
helicopter parts going to the comity of E1 Salvador? He asked MacVane
if Merala had wel:ceered other information to the Agency? He then asked
if Merala were ever paid for such information? Amos also tried to establish
the new legal and legal authority to be given a request for the U.S. War
objected to by attorney Zobert Thaller, prosecutor in the case. The judge
sustained the objection and MacVane did not have to answer the question.
Anos finished his questioning and Thaller began a short craps examination.
Thaller asked if MacVane ever heard Mcrola cention stocks? He also asked
that the U.S. War Committee, and the U.S. War Committee, said the
then-pointed out that even if case stock fraud were occurring, MacVane
would not be writing because MacVane was not an investigator, but rather
a collecte: of foreign information. The cross examination then ended.
All questions were answered to the best of MacVane's ability and knowledge.
3. There appeared to be little purpose in the appearance of MacVane
because it was obvious that MacVane knew nothing of any value concerning
the case. MacVane's total time on the witness stand was about 10 minutes.
After completion of his testimony MacVane was released.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Joseph Raymond Merola
1.1. On. 3 November I talked to Mr. Matt McVane, DCD officer
stationed in Miami. and he said that he had received the subpoena
from E:Mac Amos, Jr. to appear as a defense witness in the trial in
San Diego on il November. Mr. McVane agreed to come to Headquarters
on6 November to discuss the information in the files and Mr. Robert
Starling of DCD agreed to join in the meeting. Mr. McVane told me
that Lt. Colonel Douglas W. Haldane, who had previously been on
detail to the DCD Miami Office, had returned to the Army and was
currently assigned somewhere in Europe and that his address was
Headquarters. USAREUR, APO New York, New York 09403:
2. Since this Office had received a letter from Mr. Amos with a
request for the current address of Colonel Haldane, I called Mr. Amos
on. 4 November and explained to him that Colonel Haldane was no longer
with the Central Intelligence Agency and it was our uncerstanding that
Colonel Haldane was stationed in Europe. Mr. Amos did not want the
current address of Colonel Haldane. He did state, however, that Mr.
McVane would not be needed in San Diego until Wednesday morning,
12 November. As things stood now, Mr. Merola was the fifth defendant
and it would be that length of one before Mr. McVane's termony v ouid
be needed.
3. Mr. McVane told me that he had been called by Mr. Robert
Thaler of the U.S. Attorney's Office in California. I told Mr. McVane
that I would contact Mr. Thaler. I called Mr. Thaler who is a member
of the Organized Crime Course Force, Department of Justice, Room 2307,
300 North Los Angeles Street, Los Angeles, California 90012, telephone
No. (AC 213) 688-5808. Mr. Thaler was pleased to hear that Mr. McVane


14/0000
was being made available to testify and explained that he thought Mr.
Amos had already prepared a motion to dismiss if Mr. McVane was to be
denied as a witness for the defense. I explained to Mr. Thaler that Mr.
McVane was coming to Headquarters on Thursday, 6 November, and said
that we would call him to discuss the role Mr. McVane played in receiving
information from Mr. Merola.
4. If this case runs parallel to many critical prosecutibns, the
defense may never put Mr. McVane on the stand when he actually shows
up as this may prove detrimental to their defense. However, we should
be prepared for his testimony if, in fact, it does take place.

District of California in an action entitled to the
American Civil War. Mr. Mcc. Amon Jn. (No. 74-2277-
GT). In order to properly defend Mr. Merola, we need to
utilize the testimony of Mr. Matt McVane and possibly the
testimony of Col. Douglas Ealdane. We understand that
Mr. McVane is. employed by the Central Intelligence Agency
that Mr. Mcc. Amon Jn. (No. 74-2277-GT). The
that Col. Douglas Halmah is employed by the Central
Intelligence Agency but do not have an address for
service upon Col. Haldane.
Enclosed you will find copies of Subpoenas
issued for Mr. McVane and Col. Haldane. These Subpoenas
require the attendance of the individuals in the Southern
District of California, including the Department of
November 11, 1975 at 9:00 a.m. Enclosed you will also
find a copy of the Order signed by Judge Gordon Thompson
authorizing the issuance of the Subpoena for Mr. McVane.
Since we do not have an address for Col. Haldane at
this time, the court has not approved the issuance of
a Subpoena for him in which the government would be
responsibl.
We have been informed by Mr. McVane that it
is necessary for him to obtain the approval of your office
before he can testify in this matter. Accordingly, we
request that he be granted the necessary approval in
order to allow him to testify in this matter. In addition,
we request that we be provided with an address for
col. Haldane and that he also be allowed to testify in
this case. We would appreciate being advised as such as

determine if this prosecution was related to 22 U.S.C. 1934. -Mr. Bryant
called back and said that Merola was one of seven defendants being tried
on criminal fraud charges for having engaged in a filmfam operation
against the Salvadorian government. The scheme was to establish a
facility in Salvador to assemble and s'vice helicopters. The group had
assembled a collection of Army surplus parts for helicopters and was in
the process of shipping them without an export license and they were
seized by U.S.: Customs officers on 21 February 1974. Mr. Bryant
indicated that the Assistant U.S. Attorney in San Diego in charge of
the prosecution was a Mr. Robert Thaler, telephone No. (AC 714) 203-5668,
Mr. Bryant, a member of the American individual by the name of Henry Mater-
hofer was also one of the defendants and it was Mr. Bryant's recollection
that Merlohofer had some prevenants.
3. I called Mr. Starling and reported this information to him and
he said that Mr. Merola was a real operator in the Miami area, always
involved in some scheme to buy and sell weapons but that he had volun-
tered information to the DCD Office, some of which was useful. I asked
Mr. Starling to have:Mr. McVane call me when he got the subpoena but
that he would not have to go unless they furnished the travel funds.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Domestic Collection Division
ATTENTION:
Hr. Shaun P. Ryan
SUBJECT:
Joseph R. MEROLA
REFERENCE:
HH 25826, 8 January 1974
1. On 10 January 1974 the WH/2/GS desk received the
referenced memorandum from the Domestic Collection Division
Indicating the Miami field office had been in contact with one
of the 1st year of the 1st year of the 1st year of the 1st year
trip to El Salvador; and he reported that a friend of his had
identified a Mr. Gremillion in the Political Section of the
American Embassy in San Salvador as a suspect CIA representative.
Headquarters traces on Joseph R. MEROLA indicated that on several
years, the President of the American Embassy had been
agent. The Chief of Station, the Mr. Gremillion referred to
above, was recently questioned regarding any Embassy contact
with MEROLA while the latter was in San Salvador. The cos
sidiary was the most important Embassy community and " social
functions MEROLA had freed from referred to his contact with
the CIA, past and present. He also volunteered this infor-
mation to a former Station contact.
2. In light of the above, it would appear that MEROLA
had taken advantage of his agency contacts in an inappropriate
manner to the potential embarrassment of the San Salvador
Station. we would, accordingly, appreciate that this be given
due consideration in your assessment of the advantage of your
continued contact with him.

ratti,

the CIGS on this Lauter, retangactrazzant
assilax at the end for comments as to whether
R.ROLA is "embarrassing" the Station or CIA
generally by talking so much about his CIA
connections. If his re-ly is in the affirmative,
it will -probably be best for you to draft
the CIGS. The CIGS are not a part of the

contact with them since it is obd oualy something
that he brags about and otherwise tries to make
advantage of

Matt MacVane, DCD officer in Mi-mi, met with Joseph R. MEROLA
on 15 January 1974; at which time MEROLA identified the friend in San
Salvador who had identified Mr. Gremillion in the American Embassy in
San Salvador as a CIA representative. MEROLA also provided
the names of two women employed in the Embassy who were
involved
in compromising situations with both Americans and local nationals.
MEROLA identified the two women as Nancy SHALLOT and De1ia OBESA. MEROLA
was met again on 17 January 1974
at which time he provided the name of a third woman in the Embassy Gloria,
who has also been involved in compromising situations. Upon quaxing
Headquarters personnel who had recently returned from San Salvador, the
above identities were confirmed; all three are American citizens assigned
to the Embassy in San Salvador.

1. One of our sources in Miami, Joseph Merols, revealed
the name and positions of an individual reported to be an Agency
official in E1 Salvador to Matt MacVane during the course of an
interview on 21 December 1973. This was reported in MIM-006-74
and the 1974 year of the 1975 year of the 1976 year of the 1977
Desk on 8 January 1974. On 16 January 1974 the Desk requested
that DCD obtain the name of the individual mentioned in this
memorandum who said he knew a CIA officer in the Embassy. This
request was passed by telecon and TUX to MacVane by Ryan on
16 January 1974. The E1 Salvador Desk also questioned the
reliability of our source, Joseph Merola, at this time and
request the 1975 year of the 1976 year of the 1977 Desk.
2. On 17 January 1974 at the request of MacVane, Ryan
visited the E1 Salvador Desk to ascertain their objections to
our source, known to us as a convicted felon. Desk objections
stemmed from a 1984 report which indicated that Merola had
been the most important source of the 1975 year of the 1976
tioni elicited the fact that Merola had again made this state-
ment in 1973 at an Embassy function. We advised the Desk that
DCD was well aware of Merola's criminal background but that he
had provided DCD with reliable reports in the past unrelated
to his own "pursuits".
3. The E1 Salvador desk confirmed the fact that the
industrial industry was not responsible for inforant as being a CIA
officer was in fact such. Ryan advised MacVane of this per
toleccon on 17 January 1974. MacVane and Mainwaring told Ryan
they vere sending two cables relating to this case. The first
would provide the name of the person who reportedly knew the
CIA official. The second provided the name of two women
employed in the Embassy who were reportedly involved in

compromising situations with both Americans and local nationals.
This latter cable was requested after the E1 Salvador desk
officer advised that all avenues and possible leads were to be
pursued to determine who leaked the information relating to the
CIA official. These two nazes (prosetically spelled) were
provided in the second cable by Miami. All of the infecuation
received in these cables was passed via secure phone to the
E1 Salvador desk by Ryan upon receipt.
4. HaeVa.e advised Ryan vis teiccon that he anticipated
meeting with Joseph Merola at 1.000 on 17 January to address
further metters concerned with this case. HaeVane advised Ryan
that he would forward such information as soon as possible.

From Mitch Lawrence
Regarding Joe Benoia: Information passed on
to Lt. Van Buskirk per our discussion. Van
Buskirk advised that we should have somebody
ready to go to court and to dei. the claim
of Connel that he was working on our behalf.
The case was not a matter of evidence. And
Van Buskirk said there is no hurry, but he
would like to know whether or not we would
have somebody there in as much as this person
intends to base his defense on the basis of
his working for us.
