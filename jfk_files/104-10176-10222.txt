24 September 1968
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORI)
FROM:
WH/1 (Marvin Francis)
SUBJECT:
17 Septemiler 1968 discussion with DRISCOLL
re LIRING/2 & LIRING/4.
PARTICIPANTS: DRISCOLL, KERE, FRANCIS and Laurence
PIPER (C/WH/2/G).
1. LIRING/4 is still very concerned about the im-
prisonment of LIRING/3. LIRING/4 will) not travel to Cuba
until she is assured of the effect of TOWN/2. nuscom
has nornouzny discussed L/3 with L/4 and has pointed out
the danger of attempting to intercede on L/3's behalf
through business contacts, L/4 contacted the Cubans for
the purpose of the study. He said, "I am not aware of the
L/4
They have assisted L/4 with small amounts of money. L/3
has devised an open code which he uses in letters to let
L/4 know how he is. The letters are grim reading because
L/3 keeps stating he is unable to hold out much longer.
He said, "I am not aware of the fact that he is not
transfer him to another prison as this usually ends in the
prisoner being shot "while escaping." One good result
from the continued imprisonment of L/3 is that both he and
L/4 are furthering the prison, and his own, but he
said, "I am not sure to become contact with the Third Secre-
tary of the Mexican Embassy in Guatemala. He has made
inquiries about L/3 with the Guats on behalf of Foreign
Minister CARRILLO Flores. A few weeks ago (prior to the
assassination of the U.S. Ambassador) the Third Secretary
said, "I am not aware of the fact that he is not aware of
he considered out of the question was that L/3 would be
shot, the second was that L/4 would come to trial and be
released within a few weeks, and the third was that he would
be not aware of the fact that he was not aware of the
departing Mexico on this current trip, DRISCOLL attempted
to manage a meet with L/4 in the usual means by slipping a
typed note under her apartment door. She did not make the
meeting. DRISCOLL later learned through phone tap material
that she called the Cuban Embassy and informed them the
SECRET
201-798501


- 2 -
Mexican authorities had notified her she was being fined
500 pesos. The purpose of the payment was not identified.
Later she made a call from the Cuban Embassy which indicated
she was staying there until she could get the funds to pay
the Mexicans. DRISCOLL. therefore, concluded she had not
a
federal government agency. He said he said he said he said he
their meeting. DRISCOLL said SUAREZ (the visiting Cuba
Cultural type) has a key to L/3's apartment and might see
the note but would be unable to identify the sender since
DRISCOLL uses a meaningless statement as a signature.
3. DRISCOLL now plans upon his return to Mexico to
receive the message that he said he said he said he said he said
the
sultemeaia. 11 the Mexican Charge is unable to obtain L/3's
release in behalf of the Mexicans and if it appears he will
be held indefinitely, DRISCOLL wants to explore the possibility
of our doing something to get L/3 out so the operation can
become active.
1. The above regard L/3 was discussed with Mr. PIPER
of the Guatemala desk. Mr. PIPER believed the Station has
a high enough contact with the Guats (ESLJOR/20-Presidents
brother) to arrange to get L/3 and his Mexican compatriot out
of prison and back to Mexico with a minimum security risk.
2. The Mexican� the American community was not to
Mexico after he has talked zith L/4. DRISCOLL felt he should
possibly travel to Guatemala and have a preliminary meet with
L/3 before Guat Station makes any all out effort to officially
respond to the American community. He said he said he said he
fied that L/3 is still an ally and is willing to cooperate
after his release then DRISCOLL believes we should attempt to
have the Station intercede with ESMAJOR/20. Hopefully, ESMAJOR/
20-19, he said he said he said he said he said he said he said
has been done at the request and urging of the Mexican Govern-
ment. DRISCOLL, however. would like L/3 and L/4 to believe
he (DRISCOLL) had something to do with the release in order
to raise his status with both for the sake of future operation-
al tasks he will levy on them.

3. Next Meeting:
1000, 14/2/69; same place.
JUN 2 1969
4. Reports/Information Submitted by Avert:
DOC. MICRO. SER.
LIRING/3 told awoton that there had ceen little or no develo:ents
since he last saw lowton (21/1/69), just before Kovton had left on
his business trip to Monterrey. He commented that he had felt it
wiser not to take any initiative in seeing out his FAK friends or
revisiting the LIRING office until R. avton had recurned. Se stated
that his old Guatemalan friend, Jacoto Rodriguez Padilla,had called
on him once in the company of Carlos Teca, but nothing significant
had emerged from the casual conversation. Vega, at several points
in the conversation, had mumbled scesting to Rodriguez about the
"crisis" but nieber gave an explanation. L/3 told Rowton that he as-
suned that this remark referred to the current factionalism in the
Guateraian revolutionary struggle.
LIRING/3 then identified the attached photo of Mario Aegosto Mendes
Aguilar immediately at the first clance as that of "Róulo",eka "Mario
Mendez" and "Favel." LIRING/3 did not recognize the photo Rowton
showed him of Mario Octoiel Mendez Koina.
5. Guidance/Information Given to Agent:
Rowton told L/3 that according to the very sketchy information he
had concerning Mario Avcosto Mendez Aguiler it appeared that the latter
belogged to a strongly anti-FBRUNER faction and that this would perhaps
explain the turn-about of the LIRINGS after he, L/3, had indicated to
LIRING/9 that he was in contact with "Pavel."
Rowton urged L/3 to seek out "Rómulo" at the calle Coshuila 221 safe-
house, and, failing this, to recontact Humberto González Vega at his
home on calle Manzanillo, in the hope that the latter could arrange
a recontact with Mendes.

4. ADMINISTRATIVE: LIVING/3 told Rowton that his friend, Eerta Wigsiser
has rented a furnished apartment that can be used by
him and Newton as a safehouse as soon as it is vested
by its present occupants. L/3 explained that these cc-
cupants are relatives of 6ra Wigsiser who are visiting
from Argentina but who are expected to return to their
and
5. REPORTS/INFORMATION GIVEN 37 AGENT:
L/3 told Revton that "Rózulo" (who be identified froa
a photo as Mario Aurosto Merdes Aruilar) visited him at
his home unannounced at about 2000 on 11 February and
stayed until almost midnight.
According to L/3 Aroulo-apologized for not having seen
L/3 for so long ( last date reported was 3/1/69) ex-
plaining that he was very busy. He then stated that he
had recently seen end talked with Rodolfo Sandoval AL-
egria in the (Lucumberri)prison and was pleasantly sur-
prised to learn that Sandoval new 1/3 and spoke very
highly of him. Rómulo then went on to say that he had
known Sandoval many years and had actually been his de-
puty in Guatemala. Rómulo recalled that when he was last
arrested (te explained parenthetically that he had been
arrested four times in all) he was tutured in an effort
to make his reveal the whereabouts of Sandoval. He claimed
to L/3 tate he finally, to avoid execution, gave a false
address- that of one of Sandoval's relatives.
L/3 told Exoton that he then took the occasion to tell
Rómulo of the harrassment be war being subjected to by
various persons who he felt were being inspired by the
Chief LIRIG. L/3 told worken that Rómulo then asked him
what the false charges brought against his were. L/3 told
Rómulo the truth, saying that he kept retting reports that
he was rerarded as a LCTIK agent. According to 1/3.26-
aulo exclaimed that he should pay no attention to that

sort of slander since the LIRING office was always
trize to neutralize persons and groups not acting
urier their control. Ee added that the people who really
count in the struggle were used to such nonsense and
were aware of what the LIANIGS were up to. He added that
as soon as Sendval got out of prison he would "streighten
some of those people out" since he was personally aware
of L/3's motives and activities before this trip to t.e
border. When L/3 mentioned his contacts with Carlos Vega
(slivays at the latter's initiative), R6nulo described him
as "Fastelito, a very sectarian sneaky pro-LIRING bestard".
He said he would like L/3 to aranze a meeting with Vega
so that he could burst in and confront him with the facts.
Regarding Humerto González Vera, R6nulo said that he was
a good "elemento" and had suffered a great deal for the
cause, but at the moment was more or less out of the pic-
ture. He saw no need for L/3 to be in contact with him.
then L/3 expressed a desire to tave some way of contacting
R6nulo, the latter preesised to give him his home address
as soon as he move to a better place. He explained that
at the moment he was living in a furnished room.
At the end of the talk,when R6nulo asked when they could
get together again, explaining that he might have to go
down to Crizsba over the week-end, L/3 told Rowton that he
made a date for 1900 on 14/2/69. L/3 then surgested that
they meet outside so as not to irvolve his wife (L/3 told
 Rowton that he did this so that Rowton would have a chance
to observe ncuulo in some public place), and R6nulo agreed
but said he had a better suggestion. Re then stated that
he knew a Mexican failly very well and could arrange that
they meet at their home and have dinner. He added that he
might bring along a Brother ("herano") and would come by
L/3's home at 1900 to pick him up. L/3 agreed, saying that
he had no objection to the brother coming along.

1100, 15/2/69; Casino Real restaurant.
3. Next Meeting:
1000, 19/2/69; sea place.
4. Reperts/Information Given by Agent:
LIGHTING 3 reported that he met again with "Rénulo" but under circum-
stances somewhat different from that anticipated. L/3 related that
when he arrived at his apartment about 1850 the r. vicius evening
the company of his wife (after having droppel off his daughter at
the heme is in 10000 & note IRC "rósulo" asking his to
meet him at apartment 102 of Galle Coahuile 200.
L/3 continued that since his wife was present when he read the note
he felt he had to ask her to come along ( and in addition she had been
upset that afternoon and did not want to be left alone ). They therefore
both proceeded to the address riven by Rénulo and found him there in
the midst of a rather large number of persons, apparently of the same
family residing in the spertent. After about fifteen minutes of social
chatter, Rénulo suggested that they so to a nearby restaurant to talk
nore privately. Romulo then took L/3 and his wife to the restaurant
Kuku at Galie Coahuile 223 there they had dinner. L/3 told aorton that
because of his wife's presence he was not able to discuss anythig sub-
stantive with Romulo and had to leave the questions he wanted to ask him
re PAZ/PBURNEN activities until a subsequent meeting. L/3 sided that in
the course of conversation, Romulo stated that Rodolfo Sandoval Alegria
hoped to be released from prison in March, 1969. Romulo also stated that
he worked in a newspaper office, but 1/3 felt he could not securely ask
the name of the newspaper at that time.
L/3 told Rorton that Ronulo agreed to another meeting on 18?ébruary and
asked L/3 to net him signal at apartment 102 of Coahuile 200 shortly after
1900, inasunch as he generally leaves his place of enjoyment is little
before that mine. ncolulo, L/3 and his wife then took in a movie.
L/3 then told avonton that after he had left Rorton the previous day he had
another very disturbing experience (he appeared to Rovton nervous and suf-
fering from lack of sleep). L/3 explained that when he dropped into the
Salón de la Plastics Yecizama about 1300 on 14/2/69, he ran into an pld
friend, Pauny Ravel, a Mexican artist with who be had worked very closely
in FSHUREK soze years ago. L/3 continued to Rovton that despite their


2.
past friendship, Fzany Ravel treated his in an obvious cold manner.
L/3, feeling that he could not this pass unroticed, got Fanny in the
corner and asked what was up. the replied that for some time she had
been hesring "disturbing reports" about L/3. Under further questioning
by L/3 she specifici thatoriginally, some 7-8 conits previously she
had been told by a LIZING official that L/3 "was not to be trusted".
Fanny continued that she did not pay tco such attention to this since
the official was rather "low-level", but core recently she was/told the
same thing by an "nicipasachable source" and could not chellenge it des-
pite her high personal esteem for L/3.
L/3 cormented to Rotton that the "minpescahole source" must be the Chief
LIRING, inassuch as Fanny Ravel as always been a close pe: 301ial friend
of his and possibly even one of his mistresses. L/3 continued that
had several times cernented to him (when L/4 was working in the LIRING
office) that Panny Ravel was infrequent telephone contact with the Chief.
5. GUIDANCE Given to Agent:
Rowton told L/3 that he was 202 convinced than ever that the LIRING
office had mountel a slender operation against him because of Lis con-
tacts with the Czaillo Carchez group (Le6n Barries brothers and Romulo)
which PERNEN was apparently attempting to isciate in their own interest
"then L/3 appeared a little censoled at this, Rowton continued that he
felt L/3 should, at the 18 Feb meeting with "200mulo", tell the latter tät
he knew the gene the LIRINGS were up to and ask "R6mulo" point blank
whether he knew to what extent the LIRING office was trying to sabotage
FAR because of its nationalistic anti-2BRUNN position, Rotton asked L/3
to entice "R6mulo" into such a discussion in the hope that "R6mulo"
would ask him, L/3, to help discover any unilateral operations PERNEN
night be planning. Rorton continued that L/3 should tell Rcolu that
although he was virtually cut off from the LIRING office, he still had
a great many FEMEN friends ( e.G.
) from
whom he could possibly get useful information to help Rcolu's faction.
Rowton su.gested that L/3 could also propose to Rcolu that they both
put the squeeze on Carlos VEGA (apparently a LIRING prevcastion) to ob-
some preliminary information on the intentions of the LIRING operation.

2. Date & Site of Meeting:
1000, 19/2/69; Cazino Real Restaurant.
3. Next Meeting:
Same time,sane place, 21/2/69.
4. Reports/Information Given by lient:
LIRING/3 reported that "Rétulo" appeared unscounced at his apartment
on the late afternoon of 17/2/59 and consequently he did not go to meet
him at apartment 102 of 260 Coahuila St. on 10/2/69 as criginally planned.
LIRING/3 told Hooton that "Béculo" proised to see him again about 1500
on 20/2/69, coming to pick him up at his apartment.
LIRING/3 then stated that on the minine of 19/2/60 to the
Godoy, the wife of Jorge, at Gcbernación and was so disturbed at the cool
reception that he looked up Jorge Gooly later that day to find out what was
going on. Jorge Godoy was quite frank with him telling his that the LIRING
office had advised bis to keep clear of LIRING/3 because he was not to be
trusted. Godoy continued that a LIRING official had told him that LIRING/3
was being used ( perhaps uncceniously at first) 1y some counter-revelu-
tionery
cargenization and that the LIRING Office based it assertion on the
follow:ng three points: (1) LIRING/3 had been in touch with a foreignor who
pretended to be a businessman but who did not do any business with
(2) LIRING/3 had access to information that could come only from a police
source (3) LIRING/3 was responsible for the arrest of Identity A and
had undertaken the Lission to Guatemala to get information against the re-
volution.
According to LIRING/3, Jorge Godoy told him that it was difficult to beive
all this, especially in the light of L/3's relatively long imprisonment, but
he had to take it seriously in view of the source of the charges. L/3 mix
told Rowton that he went over each point in rebuttal on a zatter of principle
despite the fact that Godoy's mind obviously was already ande up.
LIRING/3 told Rowton that when he tickled later that day with "Réulo" he re-
lated what had happened with Godov. "Réulo" replied that those LIRING al-
legations were not to be taken seriously. He commented: "ne have already
looked into them and do not believe them." He explained that for one thing
if L/3 had beer a spy he certainly would have continued (with the approval
and connivance of the authorities) on up the the mountains where he could get
useful information, instead of permitting himself to be arrested just after
stepping across the border. "Réulo" agreed with 1/3 that the LIRING office


2.
probably does not want L/3 to help his ("R6culo8s") faction and have doc
everything possible to isolate I/3 from his cornal social contacts. Etrulo
added that the only important point in the whole affair was that there were
"certain elements" among the Custenaln revolutinaries that might believe the
LIRLIG charges and possibly do harm to L/3 and or his wife. R6tulo urred L/3
"to be careful" and for that resca di not encouraze the idea of a confracta-
tion with Carics Vega at this tire. He ccausied that if, however, L/3 taisised
he would be glad to have it out with Carlos Vera to find out who had se: in
to provoke L/3. Rowton agreed that little or nothing could be accomplished
in pursuing this matter.
L/3 crituned that when he told R6sulo that he felt frustrated and helpless
in the free of the
volutionary, have courage and patience in confronting these problems. He cen-
tinued that he himself hoped to cctinue to see L/3 and be was sure that things
would work out. He stressed that be and his factic value the friendship and
loyalty of individuals such as L/3 whereas the LIRING establishment is Iatreste:1
only in groups and organizations that can further their enn interests.
5. GULDANCE/INFRAGRINCE given to agent:
Wortoa encouraged L/3 to continue his efforts to find steady employment since
he was most vulnerable to both the LIRING agents as well as PIA in the sinter
of his financial resources. L/3 told Rowton that he had already been, promised
an appointment to some teaching pccition by Javier Escinosa, private secretary
to Yanez, the Secretary of Education. L/3 commented that Espinosa is at heart
a "good progressive" and has been very sympathetic to his since his return to
Kexico. L/3 also stated that he intends to look up Ercsleo Lepeda in the hope
that the latter can place his scroshere in CCHASUFO or arrange a job with his
Chiepas newspaper ( "Reovación").
sowton also urged L/3 to continue to elicit information from "R6sulo" ceczer-
ning his faction of the PAR and any knowledge he might have concerning the
independent operations being planned by FEACHEN in Guatemala.

Same place and time, 7/4/69.
4. Information/Reports Given by Agent:
LIANG/3 reported that unfortunately "Raculo" (Yaric Aucosto KENDEZ Aguilar)
had not reappeared since his last meeting with his ( 17/2/69) and that he
felt he could do nothing but wait for his to initiate the reconstact.
TETTNG/3 continued that on his own initiative he had drorned by the LIZING
offices on 21 March, feeling that he should not continue to remain in iso-
lator despite the unfavorable rumors against his apparently originated by
that office. He told Rowton that unfortunately he did not find anyone of
importance in the offices at that time, but was told by the gatekeeper that
"they wanted to see him" and that he should return early the followiz week.
LIANG/3 contia.ed to Rowton that instead of returning to the office be
cided to telephone LIANG/9 at his home. Re did so on the morning of 25/3/69
but was told by a woman with a Mexican accent (obviously the maid)tast neither
LIANG/9 nor LIRING/2 was at home. LIANG/3 then left his name and asked the
women to inform either of them that he had called.
LIANG/3 continued that about 1200 that sene day ( 25/3/69) his old friend,
Identity B
appeared unannounced at its spartzent. 1/3 told Rowton that
although it was obvious that Iden B had appeared in response to the tele-
phone message that 1/3 had left for LIANG/9, Iden B did not refer to it,
explaining simply that he had dropped ercund to see how LIANG/9 and his wife
were doing. He did mentionn't subsequenti in te. cevergation that he was
now livinz with LIANG/2 and LIANG/9 and LIANG/13 in their "very emple"
apartment. Iden B continued that he hoped to remain in Mexico until July
1969 and that he was pleuning to marry a Mexico disvorcee with three children
(boys) whom he had originally net many years aro in a visit to Mexico City.
LIANG/3 told Rowton that Iden B was surprisingly cordial, regretting the
fact that they had not seen eace other for some tine and echouraging LIANG/3
to keep in touch in the future. He invited 1/3 to l'ush on 29/3/69 but asked
him to telephone to confirm. He gave L/3 the telephone number of LIANG/9's
residence, apparently forgetting that L/3 already had the number.
Iden B then cold LIANG/3 not to be. disturbed over the rumors circulating
about him, since he himself had been subjected to auch the same treatment


2.
several years previously in FERCIEI. He then stated that in any case the
FEBURN Chief would not be rettamin to Mexico, and that this chould make 1/3
happy. To console 1/3, Iden B continued that the LIRING Chief was not peziler
with the staff, since he was considered to force! and scobbish, and soevert
petty in his vindiciveness. Iden B eured with 1/3 that the LIRING Chie? had
done cuch to harm LIRING/3's reputation,and probab! cested from purel personal
motives ( under the influence of Carren Lozda's father and tusband).
Iden B did not tell 1/3 whe would replace the LIRING Chief. He cammened that
for some time best he had withdrawn from politeis and tried to mind his our
business, earning its living by giving lectures on his own initiative.
On the domestic sicupion in FERKIN, Iden- B commented that things were "very
bad" both politically and economically. He explained that FABURN currently found
itself in a squeeze play between the big powers and was genuinely fearful of
a Soviet/Union reprochecment, at their expense, of course. On the econcic side
Iden B commented that be was happy to be in Mexico but added weekly that there
was every hope that things would ret better by 197C. then 1/3 countered that
everyone had been siring that tune for many years, Iden B did not defend his
position.
LIRING/3 then told Rooton that he took the occasion to mention to Iden B that
a certain Carlos Veza ( akaGrlos Enrique LOPPE Cercis) had been pestering his
in the hope of finding someone traveling to FURMEN who would be willing to
carry some packages to score of his friends (including the son of Turcios). Jhep
L/3 asked Iden B whether he would be willing to meet this Carlos Vege before
consenting to carry over his packages, Iden B replied; "SI,como no. Con mucho
gusto."
LIRING/3 commented to Rovton that he brought up the name of Carlos VEGA as a
sign of good faith both vis-avis the latter as well as the LIRING office since
he felt it highly probable that Vega was reporting regularly to the LIRING cople
either directly or indirectly and that in fact Vega had possibly been sent to
check on LIRING/3 and his wife. LIRING/3 continued that he planned to recom-
tect Jacobo Rodríguez Padilla and ask him to pass along the message to Carlos
Vega that LIRING/3 was anxious to see him again since be felt that he had re-
solved Vega's "problem."
LIRING/3 also tcd Rovton that he had expressed the desire to Iden B to re-
visit FURKING soce time in the future. Iden B replied that he would do every-
thing he could to expedite the visa, which he said he felt present no problem.
LIRING/3 also told Rovton that LIRING/4 had received a letter from her other
asking her to attenpt to obtain a 30-day visitor's visa for her to come to
Mexico on vacation. LIRING/3 told Rovton that he and had already


3.
made formal application for the visa, although they were not optimistic that
Goberasción would grant it. LIRING/3 added that he did not mention this deve-
lopment to Iden B although he might possibly mention it in passing
at his next chat. LIRING/3 commented to Rotte. that he felt LIRING/4's mother
might have some interesting rossip but could ret be expected to tell him and
LIRING/4 anything startling. He added that he had applied for the visa more out
of courtesy that in earnest and actually hoped that the visa would not be
granted, since this would give him and LIRING/4 a good pretext to make another
trip to FENUMEN for purely personal reasons.

4. Information/Reports Given by Agent:
LIRING/3 reported that at long letst R&Smulo"( Mario Aucosto Hendez
Aguilar) had reappeared at his apartment, or. the afternoon of 2 April,
without prior notice, as usual. LIRING/3 told Norton that "R&Smulo"
apologizes for not having been able to revisit LIRING/3 before that
date, and explained that he had been "out of town". According to L/3
"anuo- cia not give any explanation of his absence since mid-Tebruary
and L/3 felt he could not ask for such expincation. "R&Smulo" preised
to keep in touch with LIRING/3 by dropine in to his apartment "wherever
he could". LIRING/3 told Ronton that he rade a disrcvet effort to ret
from "R&Smulo" a telephone nater or address through which he could be
contacted.
LIRING/3 also reported that he hed =et with Iden B
twice during
Easter week, but as yet had been unable to get into his residence, as he
had hoped. He stressed that his relationship with Iden B
was in-
proving steadily and he felt this a good sign, inasmuch as he felt certain
that
Iden B
would not take the initiativeof recontacting LIRING/3
without prior consultation with LIRING/3 and LIRING/2.
LIRING/3 then told Rovton that LIRING/4 hed received a very pessimistic
letter fro: a certain Echeneedia, e cude residing in Brooklyn, New York,
who stated that LIRING/4's fester was dying of cancer of the throat and
was unable to leave his home. LIRING/3 continued that he had just dis-
covered that LIRING/4 on her own iriitative had rushed to the U.S. Con-
sulate and requested a visa. As she subsequently told LIRING/3, LIRING/4
was informed by a consular officinl that her case would have to be "in-
vestigated carefully by JCACT" and that she was required to pay 125 pesos
for a telegram to Washington,D.C. to expedite the case. LIRING/3 told
Rovton that he felt LIRING/4's action had been precipitous: and could cause
his additional embarrassment with the LIRING office. He added that he did
not think a visa would be tranied, but asked Newton to do whatever he
could to rake certain that LIRING/4's request was turned down. As con-
tinued that in view of this unexpected development, he felt it wise


2.
to recontact LIIRING/9 and tell him about 1.4's application for the
viss. Rowton agreed that this would be the best ccurse of nction,especi-
ally since LIANG/3 had originally mentioned LIHIG/4's desire to visit
her sick father and the problem this represented for him, when he first
talked to LIANG/9 after his return from Guatemala.
LIHING/3 t-1d Rowton that he felt this would also constitute a good pre-
text to sound out LIHIG/9 about his personal feelings toward LIANG/3
and his own situation in the LIHIGCffice. Rowton sucested that LIANG/3
take this occasion to mention casually that he was still in occasional
contact with the Guatemalans and to give LIHIG/9 the names of "R6mulo"
and Carlos Vera, if L/9 asked for details.

4. Information/ Reports Given by Agent:
LIRING/3 reported that he received an unexcreted visit on 9/4/69
from Rozelio Acuirre, boother of Gerjes Aguirre, whom both he and
LIRING/4 have known for many years (from their work together in
FARMEN). LIRING/3 tild Rovton that he was surprised at the visit
in
wouk
adezise and
overgee
assurine
were
close
irleans
or
versa
Lozada and her husband, Carlos Fersbal. L/3 explained to Rovton
that both Rozelio and Jerres are employed in the Sacretaria de
Educaton where Teress Lozada worked for severol years.
LIRING/3 continued to Rovton that Rozelio, without making any
reference to the Persabal family, asked LIRING/3 to do him an
important favor. He went on to state that, as LIRING/3 new,
Identity C
, was currently living in her home
town in FBRUMEN (the same area that LIRING/4 comes from) and was
hoping to visit them in Mexico City in the near future. Rozelio
continued that he hoped that LIRING/3 could have a check from a
Canadian bank and immigration documents hand-carried to Iden C
so that she could pay for the ticket and present the Mexican
visa locally in FURGNE. LIRING/3 told Rovton that although he felt
& bit mystified at this request, he told Rogelio Acuirre that he
would do what he could to find someone who was planning a trip to
PBZUMEN in the near future.
LIRING/3 continued to Rovton that the naze of his friend! Iden B
immediately case to his mind.and he attempted to telephone
him at the apartment of LIRING/9. He, however, found that the tele-
phone was not in service,and felt that he had an excellent pretext
to visit the apartment about 1500 on that same day ( 11/4/69) ex-
plaining to
Iden B
(and/or LIRING/2 or /9) that he had to get
in touch urgently to pass on the request of Rogelio Acuirre. LIRING/3
agreed with Rovton that he could take this occasion to ask the LIRING
office to attempt to obtain information on the state of health of the


2.
father of LIARIG/4 through the LIARING office in New York City. LIARING3
agreed that there was li. tle chance of this request being honored, but
it would serve to reves! his lack of any other channels to LIARING/4's
father and stress the legitimacy of LIARING/4's concern for the health
of her father( an application for a visa to visit him).
LIARING/3 then stated to Rovton that he suspected the telephone of the
LIARING/9 apartment was stepped. He explained that generally when he had
called in the past, there was an unexplained interruption in the line
before the party could reply. He stressed to Rovton that this was his
nem
recently as 9/4/69 did not make any comment about the telephone service
in the apartment.
LIARING/3 hasised Rowton that when he visite the apartment that afternoon
he would take as good a note as possible of the lay-out and furnishing
and ascertain the identity of the zaid.

D. Reports/Information Given by Arent:
LIRING/3 apolorized for not having been able to make the lest
scheduled meeting with avorton, 1000 on 18/4/69. He explained that
his friend, Iden B
, had unexpectedly dropped in to see him
at that time and he felt it more important to see his again then to
make the meeting with Acwton ( he subsequently left a
annoon's answering service).
LIRING/3 contiued that he explained to Iden B
the
soticnal
strain that LIRING/4 was underroing as a result of the bad ne's con-
cerning her father's health. He then asked Iden B to attempt to as-
certain the true state of his health through the LIRING Office in New
York and gave Iden B the name and telephone number of the aunt of
LIRING/4 who appeared to be the best source. Iden B
, according
to LIRING/3 promised to send a message with the next pouch and hoped
to have news for LIRING/3 within the next ten days.
According to LIRING/3, Iden B
then succested that LIRIG/3
think about moving to FERMEN for a "lengthy stay, perhup! indefinitely.
He explained that the felt he understood LIRIG/3's problems, the'slus-
nies, the subtle persecution and the resultant increasingly difficult
financial situation he found himself in, and he felt there was no real
solution in Mexico. In FERMEN, however, he could meane much more easily
for his wife and child, since most of his basic financial prolems would
be solved. He added that he was sure that he c.uld find LIRING/3 soxe
sort of work in the cultural field as soon as he returned to FERMEN and
then arrange an invitation. LIRING/3 told Rotoron that although he regarded
this proposition as encouraging ( since he was certain that Iden B
had prior approval from the LIRING Office), he took a natural and logical
approach in replying to Iden B He stated that he told Iden B that in
principle he accredbut he had to face the reities of the situation. First
he was not at all certain that he could convince his wife to make such a
move, and second, he was not optimistic that Iden B could arrange a good
position for him in FERMEN that would permit him to vork ariciously and,
of course, make enough soney to meet his living expenses.
Iden B


2.
replied that he felt it quite rosable to arrange something for LIRING/3
and for that reascn hei brogast 33 the idea at this point.
Rovton told LIRING/3, is replr to his cuery. that such a trip to PRINKE:
would be interesting to him only if LIRING/3 was offered a position in
the cultural field with good access to PRINKE intellectuals and govern-
ment officials. LIRING/3 a: reed, commenting that he
Iden D
and such young reboladwell conoug to develep good contact with them, provided
he was given a resascabl' sericus job. IL 33V case he promised to work c:
LIRING/4 in the nops of persucid: her to ro along with him, when and if
Iden B's
proposal naterialized.
LIRING/3 continued that Iden B
then cffered to arranse en exposition
for LIRING/3 at
Iden F
in Cuernavaca,stung that he could

was a close friend of his. LIRING/3 accepted this aperently genuine offer
and arranzed to travel to Cuernavaca on the morning of 22/4/69 to talk the
matter over with the director of the art caileries.
LIRING/3 then reported to Rotor tast "Résuilo" had segn visited him at his
apartment late on the evening of 33/4/69 ( thus anticipating the meeting
for 1830 in front of woolworth's for the following day,as originally planned).
According to LIRING/3, "Résuilo" ( Yario Avosto Mendez Aulilar) told his that
he had taken the liberty of coming that evering to LIRING/3's apartment since
he wanted to talk in private of "something that LIRING/3 sould do, to help
his friends". "Rémulo" then went c= to exp:ain that one of his comrades was
expeced to arrive in Mexico City "in the cear future" and would need a
sc-
cure place to live, at least until be could find a place of his own. "Rémulo"
stressed that this person, whose identity he himself did not asstet know, wauld
be traveling "clandestinely" and could not risk renting a roon on his own
until he had established hisself in the ares. LIRING/3 replied that he, of
course, would do his best, but cipited out that he himself was not in a rood
position to protect anyone. He fisillr agreed that this person might be able
to use his kitchen as temporary living quarters, entering and leaving the
apartment throught the backservice)entrance. LIRING/3 pointed out to "Réulo"
that the back door to the apartment house was locked as 1700 every day and
that therefore it would be necessary for the person using that entrance to
return to the apartment for good every nirt before 1700. "Réqulo" was ap-
parently satisfied with this offer of LIRING/3 and proposed to let him know
when the person arrived in Mexico City.
*Rémulo" then mentioned to LIRING/3 that
Iden E
was currently in the


3.
PARKING capital and trat he hirself ("Raplic", was in core or less regular
touch with the mother 01 "E) Chino", (whon 112.00/3 understood toke Yon

Witt regard to "Ranulo's" request for assistance, Rovton stated that
he would be much more interested in this development, when end if LIRING/3
could get the identity of the cormede of "Rerule" when he was to provide
a safethouse for. Rowton suggested that LIRING/3 put this person up when he
appeared for a few days, long encurt to permit Rowton to get a lock at him
and identify him. A determination could then be made us to the best course
of action for LIRING/3 with regard to this person. In re:17 to LIRING/3's
query, Rowton thought that it would be best to reinsure vital the LIRING
office regarding this matter by casually mentionine to
Iden B
that
he was performing this service for his PIR friends. LIRING/3 agreed,com-
menting that he hoped that he would for neain be caught in the cressfire
between the LIRING Office and the naticnalist fectien of the FAR.

because they believed the columns exceed against thin by Cerlos
Ferzessi,
According to LARK/3, the quent
Guthemalan told his that his friends back in Guatemala City continued
to have confidence in IIRNG/3, but "bad to respect the opinions of
others,and had no alternative but to discontinue correspondence with
LIRING/3,at least for a respectable period." He continued that LIRING/3
should realize that their crancization in Guatemala City was in no
position to check out verious and sundry charges nate against their
friends and had to let the take care of most of their problems of this
sture.
LIRING/3 told Rowton that he finally gave the unexpected house-true at

letter
to
his
studi.
He thee asked the quest to remain as inconspicuous as possible, infermien
him that he erected a number of children that afternoon for an art lesson
in the apartment. The Guanadagnan promised to be out of the apartment during
the day and to return late d night. LIRING/3 told Rowton that in fact he
did not reappeer until about 2300 that night,and left before C7CO the
following morning. then he returned at about 2200 on the night of 24/4/69
he informed LIRING/3 that he would be leaving the apartment the next crning
carly and would not have to return. He thanked LIRING/3 profusely the
next norring (25/4/69) and left at about 0900 without telling LIRING/3
where he intäted to go.
LIRING/3 continued to Revtton that at about 1930 on 23/4/69,when he returned
to his apartment, he found "Rópulo" ( Mario Mendez A-ullar) in his living
roos having coffee with his wife. LIRING/3 took the occasion to tell Rómulo
about the unexerted houseguest. According to LIRING/3 "Rómulo" aspered
genuinely surprised and asked for the identity and physical description of
the person. Then LIRING/3 told him as much as he knew, "Rómulo" stated that
he could not 11cientify the person as a friend of his. He speculated that the
unannounced guest had been sent to check on LIRING/3 and advised him to
be cautious and as normal as possible in his routine while the person re-
main in the house. He said that he did not exclude the possibility that
this person had been sent bv the LIRING office "to check on LIRING/3's
private life". "Rómulo" then offered LIRING/3 a revolver for his self-
defense, but LIRING/3 turned it down, saying that he was not worried to
that extent. According to LIRING/3, "Rómulo" stated that he
hisself pre-
ferred to avoid meeting the young Guaternalan since he could not identify
him. He reassured LIRING/3 that his own course who might also be in need

of a safercom would not appear unannounced is such a manner, additive
that to date he did not have any definite word on this person's ZEA
in Mexico City.
LIRING/3 told Horton that he expects "R6nulc" to revisit him at his
hore socetine durin the late evening of 26/4/69. We told Rovton that
it occurred to his that he might invited
Iden B
to the apertment
on the same night in the hope that he could witness a face-te-face meeting
with "R6nulo" and Iden B. 20 felt that this would serve to keep his hands
as clean as possible in the eves of the LIRING office, since he ves certain
that Iden B
would report promptly of his meeting with "R6nulo."
Rorton agreed, feeling that it was important for LIRING/3 to bring
e
occasional reetings with "R6nulo" fullv to the attention of the
office, on the off-chance that they already did not know about thet, and
that Iden B
would be the best channel for this.

LIRING/3 announced with aseparent pleasure that at len: last the
como channel with the P.R had teen reopened. He stated that he
had just received a letter from the elder of the two Léon Barrios
brothers ( Miguel and Judn) indicating that in his mind the long
period of "probation" was over tixt and that closer contact could
be
a
letter dated 28 April, 1950 in the lastdeting he stated he receog-
nixed as that of Mucel/Barrios, in which the writer, who signed
the letter as "Julio Antonio", informed LIRING/3 that he had just
been released from prison ( "senatorio") and was pelming to leave
town until things cool off for him. LIRING/3 told Rovton that he
understood the double-talk of the writer to mean that he needed
money (Q.100) to travel to Mexico where he hoped to visit IRING/3.
Rovton's photostat and translation of the letter is attached here-
with.
The cuclope, postnarked Guatemala City,2/5/69, is addressed to
LIRING/4 (as previously recuested by LIRING/3) and bears the re-
turn address J. Antonio Medina, 24 Calle 1-65, Zona 1, Guatemala,
and was sent special delivery. LIRING/3 told Rovton that he did
not recognize the return address,and assumed that it,as well as
the sender's name, Medina, was notional. He added that "Violeta"
was the code word for oper: tional contact with anyone arriving
on behalf of the Léon Barrios brothers, and that Doña Luisa referred
to Narta, the mother of the Léon Barrios brothers.
When Rovton agreed that LIRING/3 should send some money,no more
that 1,000 pesos ( Q 80 ) with a cover letter from LIRING/4 (os-
tennibly) but in his own handwriting, explain in double-talk
that fortunately be is doing fairly well financially and that
LIRING/4 is now working in an art gallery and expects to inherit
money from her futher who recently passed away. LIRING/3 promised
to have the cover letter and envelope ready when he met with Rovton
on 7/5/69 so that he could insert the money order. 1/3 told Rovton


2.
that to felt it best to send the money orier in the nas of Elsa,
the eldest of the León Earmios sisters, rather the to the mother
(Carte) as requested in the letter. He exp sired that the last money
order (actually certified bank check) in Elsa's name, sent by LIRING/4,
arrived safely and apperently was carhed without difficulty. Rowton
suggested that ILLIG/3 seed the letter, re-istered with receipt requested,
just to be sure that the letter arrived at its destination.

BurnbertoX*GOONZALEZ Vega, whom MENDEZ called "El

on his own initiative. MENDEZ said that "El Gato"
was a "good element" but emphasized that he (KENDEZ)

in Mexico and a suspected PERUMEN contact. The
Station had the LIEBRACE team cover the entrance
of the building where LENDZ and other FAR members
have an apartment they use for clandestine meetings
with LIRING-3. Despite the fact that the team
knows LIRING-3 from previous surveillance and that
the LIRING-3 was not a single of the most important
provided, the LIEBRACES spotted neither man. The
Station naturally plans to cover another meeting
and is also exploring the possibility of determining
the quality of the service. The LIRING-3 was
some interest to note that LENDZ, although he gave
LIRING-3 the agreed upon recognition signal, may
still not be the "Pavel" LIRING-3 was told he would
meet. LIRING-3 was shown a photograph of Oscar
LIRING-3. The LIRING-3 was not a single of the
letter drop in Mexico City used by Michelle Jeannette

friend of Chief, LIRING, LIRING-3 sourced the rumors,
to the LIRING headman. He first took up the matter

in the past he had been connected "with a person of
mysterious and suspicious affiliations," a clear
understanding of the LIRING-3. The LIRING-3 was
LIRING-3 insisted he wanted to discuss the matter
of the allegations made against his directly with
Chief, LIRING, LIRING-9 promised to make an appoint-
ment of the LIRING-3. The LIRING-3 was not a single
materialized. That Chief, LIRING may have spread

23 December,1968
Subject:
LIRING/3 Report of Contact by "Favel" of FAR.
1. LIRING/3 reported to Rowton at 1000 on 23/12/68 at the restaurant
in the Camino Real Hotel that at long last the FAR contact promised by
the León Barrios brothers had appeared. LIRING/3 told Rowton that et about
1900 on 19 December a Guatemalan came to his apartment and intpinduced
himself as "a friend of Violeta." L/3 invited him in but asked him not to
discuss anything sensitive in the presence of his wife. After about ten
minutes of chit chat in the apartment, L/3 and the Gustemalan, who gave
his name sily as "Rómulo", went to a nearby restaurant to talk privately.
2. According to LIRING/3, the Guatemala stated that he had been ordered
by FAR to maintain contact with L/3. When queried by L/3 regarding the
Humberto González Vega whom he had met previously
"Oh, you mean 'El Gato' - he's a good element, but he will not beay your
FAR contact. I have been entrusted with that mission. "Rómulo" also stated
that he knew Francisco Lara well and had worked with him in Guatemala City
some time ago until Lara was arrested. "Rómulo" added that unfortunately
Lara's mother had betrayed him to the police and he barely escaped arrest
at that time. "Rómulo" confirmed that Lara had been under a cloud as far
as his superiors were concerned and had made the ill-feted trip
in order to attempt to clear himself of charges against him.
3. When LIRING/3 told "Rómulo" that he had been in touch with the LIRING
office since his return, the latter exclaimed, "But what have the LIRING
people to do with us?" This gave L/3 the definite impression that "Rómulo"
himself was not in touch with a PEÉUMEN representative in Mexico City,and,
in any case, did not like the LIRING establishment.
4. He then asked L/3 to give him a summary report of the arrest and detention.
L/3 told Rowton that he balked at this at first, protesting to "Rómulo" that
he had already given the details to the León Barrios bretthers and"Cebolito"
who he was sure had passed on the report to the FAR in Guatemala. 'When
"Rómulo" explained that he would appreciate an oral report on the spot since
he was not fully informed because of comunications problems, LIRING/3 told
Rowton that he went over the whole episode for "Rómulo's" benefit. "Rómulo"
then asked to see LIRING/3 again at 1100 on 21 December to continue their
discussion. He promised to meet L/3 on the street in front of his apartment
house at the appointed time.
5. LIRING/3 continued to Rowton that much to his surprise and indignation
he received a letter on the following day(20/12/68) from Martha, the mother


2.
of the Le6n Barrios brothers, in which,among other things, she stated that
"the man on the bicycle", which L/3 explained to Hooton meant Carlos
Ferasbal
had written a letter containing grave charges
against LIRING/3. The letter, which L/3 read aloud to Rotton, went an to
assure L/3 that these charges were not believed but constituted a source
of annoyance to the writer's friends.
6. LIRING/3 continued to Rowton that he felt so indignant and shockd at
this unpleasant development that he decided to see the Chief LIKING and
have it at with him. L/3 explained that since the Chief LIRING is on very
friendly terms with the father-in-law of Persabal he might be aware of the
letter and even possibly encouraged Persabal to write it. L/3 told Rotton
that he then got in touch with LIRING/2 by telephone and made a date to meet
am at the LIRING establishment at 0930 on 21/12/62. when he arrived at the
gate at that time he was told that LIRING/2 had not yet arrived. After a wai'
of some twenty minutes, LIRING/2 appeared but asked LIRING/3 to wait a little
longer since he was very busy. After another annoying wait, LIRING/9 appeared
instead of LIRING/2 and talked with LIRING/3 on the patió. LIRING/3 explained
that he wanted urgently to talk with the Chéf LIRING since something had
come up with regard to Persetal. He reminded LIRING/9 that he originally had
expressed a desire to have a face-to-face confrontation with Persabal in
the LIRING office so that he could present his report on the arrest in his
presence. LIRING/9, according to LIRING/3, brushed this off again with the
comment, "But as I told you before, you're making a mountain of a solehill.
You're exaggerating the whole business."
7. LIRING/3 told Rowton that he then took out Martha's letter and insisted
that LIRING/9 read it. The latter expressed samezement at the revelation of
Persabal's action but did not agree with LIRING/3 that the Chief LIRING
would be able to shed ligat on it. LIRING/3 then told LIRING/9 that he did
not like the ganes that everyone seemed to be playing with him, and asked
LIRING/9 point bäank what it was thet zotivated him to ask for a written
report of the arr:st and,after L/3 complied with the request, to gerr his
feet. L/3 continued that he felt he had been frank with the LIRING office,
whereas on the other hand they were not honest with him in telling him what
they thought of him. L/9 then assured L/3 of his confidence inhib and added
that in the past certain persons, including Hugo, the assistant to LIRING/11,
had felt thatLIRING/3 had been connected with a person of mysterious and
suspicious affiliations. I/L/3, understanding this to be a clear allusion to
Rowton, admitted to having known this person in the past and having had
CS CCI


3.
a few business transactions with him, including the sale of a number of
his paintings, but insisted with some annoyance that this had, got bearing
on his political activity. LIRING/9 agreed and saded that it was really a
thing of the past that should not bother LIRING/3. He promised to make an
appointment for LIRING/3 to see the Chief LIRING soretime the following week.
8. LIRING/3 continued that when he met with "RBMulo" later that morning he
also showed the letter from Martie to him. According to L/3, "RBMulo" became
indignant and suggested that they talk to Fersabal toctether to get to the
bottom of the matter. L/3 and "RBMulo" then took a taxi to the residence of
Fersabal in the hope of finding him in at the time. when L/3, however, rang
the outside beal he was told bya vonan ( who he suspects NIXK was either
Persabal's wife or sister-in-law) that Tersabal was not at hose. L/3 noted
the woman's astonishment in cer tuce of voce wuen ce staves as name so
wear
request. "RBMulo" who was present later commented that L/3 should hot have
given his name since it was obvious that MRMX Fersabal was at home but did
not want to see LIRING/3.
9. According to L/3, "RBMulo" at the second meeting stated that "several"
friends of his were planning to return to Guatemala to continue their work
for the PAP and that he hoped that LIRING/3 might be able to help in this
mission. "RBMulo" did not specify what kind of assistance he expected from
LIRING/3 but promised to give him details when the time came for action in
this matter. He promised to see L/3 again at 1600 on 24 December,1968.
10. LIRING/3 told Rvoton that he planned to insist on seeing the Chief LIRING
IN THE HOPE of determining his resection to the charges by Persabal in view
of the Chief's friendship with the in-laws of Fersabal.

b) Contact with "R&mulo": LIMING/3 told Rotten that he again sae
R6mulo, the FAZ liaison, outside his apartment house at about 1610
on 20 Despber,ce preseaced. In view of what had transpired a
faw short time earlier that afternoon, he told R6mulo about the
corments made by Carlos L5pez. R6mulo, according to L/3, did not
indicate that he knew Lofes at all, but agreed with L/3 that the
accusations of Perzabal must be net head-on. He suggested the fol-
lowing course of action: L/3 should wait for the reply from Marta
(mother of Le6n Barrios brothers) as to the exact cherics made by
Perzabal before taking up the zatter with the Chief LIRING. EZ
tended to agree with L/3 that the LIRING establishment might tave
inspired Perzabal's letter, but felt it would be better if L/3
had a statement from Marta before accusing the PERUWENERS of had
a
arrange a confrontation with Ferzabal in the presence of three
"important FAR officials in Mexico", including a certain "Julioz
also known as "Buda". R6mulo felt that Buda could lure Perzabal to
a private meeting sinne the latter itxax already had interviewed
bim some time ago and would be anxious to see him again. This would
provide a good pretext for a confrontation between Perzabal and
LIRING/3 to clear up the whole matter.
C) Procosed Meeting with LIMING Chief: LIRING/3 told Rovton that he
felt it essential to see the LIMING Chief on the morning of 27 Dec
even if he does not receive a reply from Marta by that time. Ee
explained that he felt he could get some sort of statement from the
LIRING Chief, either affirzing or denying his knowledge of the
Perzabal letter so that he could use this in a posiable meeting with
the latter in the presence of R6mulo and his colléagues. He said
that he felt this important in view of a possible invitation to
PERUWEN that he might receive momentarily.
5. Information/Guidance Given to Agent: Rovton cautioned L/3 against jumping
the gun in accusing the LIRINGs of inspiring the Perzabal letter,
po
inting out that it could just as easily and logically have come
from such Guatemala exiles as Navarette,Capuano, or even persens
of the César Montes group,who are expected to be close to the
LIRINGS and the CFM as well as possibly that FTO

Camino Real restaurant that be had again met briefly with "Rónulo"
in front of bis (L/3's) apartment house about 1600 on 27/12/68. On
this occasion "á6nulo" identified himself as Mario Mendez and promised
to give LIRING/3 a telephone at which he could be contacted in the fu-
ture.
2. Wita regard to the Perzabal accusations, "Káwulo" again cautioned
LIRING/3 against jumping the gur with the Chief of LIRING ( i.e. accusing
him of having inspired the charges), since if the LIRING Chief called
his bluff, L/3 would have no proc'. "á6nulo" recommended that L/3 wait
until he received a reply from Marta giving details of the secusatios
before proceeding urtner. he sued what at the and he
would gladly confront Persabal and clear up the matter.
3. LIRING/3 described "Rónulo" as a Guatemalan of about 28 years of age,
516", 125 lbs, straight black thinning hair, small eyes,clipped moustache.
L/3 aided that "Rónulo" frequently squints his eyes, either from a cervous
hsbit,or case physical defect. LIRING/3 drew Rowton a rough sketch of
"á6nulo" as he recalled him from the three brief meetings he has had with
him to date.
4. LIRING/3 also gave Rowton the original of the letter from Harta
postmarked 18 December, 1968, in which mention was made of the Perzabal
charges. L/3 reminded Rowton that Perzabal is referred to in the letter
as "el hcbre de la bicicleta", and that the Le6n Barrios brothers (sons
of Marta) as "los patojos."
5. LIRING/3 also gave Rowton the original letter of Kéxixx Cscar Moiss
Roldén Espinoza dated 27 November,1968, which LIRING/3 had received on
1 December,1968. The envelope bears the same return address as that of
7 November,1968. Roldán encloses the negative of a snapshot of himself
as a "recuerdo." The letter contains general greetings and a plea for
whatever help L/3 can manage to give Roldán.
6. LIRING/3 asked Rowton's approval to send 500 pesos to Marta (via her
sister) to encourze her to continue writing him and keeping him informed
of what develops, especially if end when her sons are released. Rowton
agreed but stressed that L/3 should explain that he had managed to have
this extra money as a result of his recent exposition and to regret that
he could not send more.

Subject: LIRING/3 Peppert of Keeting with FAB Membere in Mexico City.
1. LIRING/3 reported to Rowton at the Robin Restaurant at 1700 on 30/12/68
that when he returned to his apartment at about 120C on 28/12/68 he
found Mario Kendez (eka "Bomulo") waiting in the coppany of another FAB
mumber, wmon L/3 described as "very fat" aged about 25 with a droppie
moustache. L/3 told Rovton that since he did not wish to involve his die
in conversation with these persons, invited them outside to a nearby res-
taurant.
2. According to LIRING/3 Mario Kendez and his friend told his that FAB
had decided finally to withdraw all its forces from the cities and to
regronn in the manteins in vire of the
virtual impossibility of effective action in the urban areas of Gustezala.
They stated that they and a number of their corades in Mexico were planning
to return to Guatemala and join the FAR forces in the mountains. They then
invited LIRING/3 to accompany them on their return trip, feeling that is
that way he could contribute more to the struggle. In reply to L/3's queries
they did not specify how L/3 was to survive another trip and in fact be
of any use to them in the mountains. They sirply said that they felt it
would be useful to give vide publicity to L/3's presence in the mountains,
once he reached that area. L/3 told Rovton that he reacted to this sccevhat
starting proposal in as local a way as possible, saying that he would
have it give it careful thought, inasmuch as it raised a number of very
serious problems with him and his failly. Mario Kendez and his friend con-
cluded with a rousing cheer for the "real revolutinaries" who put asie
all thoughts of personal safety and cefort and rush into the battle. then
L/3 pointed out that they thamselves after all had withdrawn from the action
they replied that precisely for that reason they intended tp return and
do their share for the cause.
3. LIRING/3 also reported that he and his wife spent the 29th of December
with Orlando Suarez in Cernavaca and had lunch with him and Jorge Godoy.
Suarez remarked privately to L/3 that he had visited the LIRING offices on
24-25 December and was "not pleased" with corments be had hard concerning
LIRING/3. 2e recompended that L/3 see the Chief LIRING as soon as possible"
to put the record straight concerning the circunstances surrounding his
arrest and especially his, subsequent release. Suarez intimated that the
Chief LIRING apparently favored the version given by Ferrabli, with whose
in-laws he was on very close personal terms. LIRING/3 told Rowton that he
planned to try again to meet privately with the Chief LIRING on the morning
of 31 December,1968.

4. In reply to Rowton's questions concerning the identity of the fclowning
names that appear in the letters to his from Farta Barrios de León, LlkiNG/3
made the following clarifications:
1) "Los caichitos" and "Los patojos" refer to Juan and Miguel León
Barrios.
2) "Eas" is the true name of the elieat León Barrios sister (apparent
age 25).
3) "La negra" is a Loón Barrios sister aged about 14.
4) "La chiquita" is a six-year-old sister of the León Barrios brothers.
5) "Felissa" is the novia of Juár Cresé León Barrios.
6) "Yuri" is a child, probably of Maria Elena, who is a close friend
and possibly relative of the León Barrios family.
7) La korotia" and "Mari" whose identity L/3 never learned are both
active members of FAR who frequently visited the León Barrios
brothers and acted as FAR courier".
5. LIRING/3 lowton that as regards the praxzern proposed revisit to
Guatemala, he was prepared to discuss this with lowton and would be willing
to undertake the hazardous mission. "if there were no other alternative",
but that in any case careful plans would have to be worked out especially
with regard to comnuicuations, if lowton hoped to profit by L/3's rezewed
involvement with FAR in Guatemala.

Subject: LIAING/3 Report of Meeting at PAH Safehouse.
1. At 2100 on 1/1/69 et the Robin Restaurant Liki G/3 reported to Rovton
that he went, as requested by "Rá地面", to Calle Costhula 221 (across
from woolworths near the corner of Insurçettes Sur) and found "Ráhoulo"
in apartment 12 in the company of two other persons, previously unknown
to LIRING/3. Both appeared younger than "Ráculo" and one could easily be
his brother because of the physical resemblance. The other, apparent age
25, light skinned,who was introduced simply as an Eusadcriar, had a good
Gatemalan accent, and revealed in his remarks an excellent knowledge of
Guatemala. The Ecuadorian, who had the most pleasant personality of the
three, remarked during the conversation that he had been imprisoned in
the old penitentiary in Guatemala City and subsequently "thrown" over the
wonder wo adviseor.
2. LIRING/3 told Rovton that the small apartment contained nothing that he
could see but a table and several chairs and was obviously a safehouse
rather than a residence. "Bánulo" later confirmed this when he told L/3
that they would have to meet there in the future only by appointment since
they did not live there but came only from time to time to talk. is a re-
sult, LIRING/3 zade a date with them for 1600 on Friday, 3/1/69, at which
time he, L/3, would come to the apartment. "Ránulo" promised to wait for him
at the entrance to the apartment building so that L/3 would not have to
ring the bell and wait outside the door unnecessarily.
3. During the friendly discussion that ensued in the apartment, L/3 took
the line previously agreed on with Rovton with apparent success. The young
Ecuadorian showed his approval by nodding his head several times, when L/3
outlines his reasons for not accepting at cnce the proposal to return to
Guatemala. "Romulo" was less sympathetic, and when L/3 stated that he felt
it necessary in any case to travel first to PBAUMEN to get his wife settled
"Rámulo" shrugged his shoulders,rearking, "But can't she get by herself.
L/3 then offered to be of any service while in PRAUREIN, but did not re-
ceive any psitive reaction. "Ránsulo" responded simply with a "Yes, we'11
see." L/3 made sure to drop the statement that he was plainin as a matter
of fact to see LIRING/9 the following morning to talk about the trip which
L/9 himself had already volunteered to arrange.
4. When the subject of Fersbal's calumnies against L/3 came up toward the
end of the conversation, "Rámulo" told L/3: "Don't worry aqout that any more
A
guatemalen, whom you don't know, will take care of that matter 'de una ve:
L/3 told Rovton he felt this remark was too full of foreboding for him to
ask for details. He agreed to come again to the apartment at 1600 on 3/1/69.

when LIRING/3 had to leave to make the contact with "Rénulo" at its apart-

8 January, 1969
Subject:
LIRING/3 Report of Allegaticn of WOPIM Affiliation.
1. At 1000 on 7 January, 1969, at the restaurant of the Calind Real Hotel
LIRING/3 reported to Rowton that he had just received three letters from
Harta Barrics de León, the mother of the León Parrios brothera (Miguel
and Juán) whom he had originally set during his confinement in Guatemala
City. He gave the original letters, zowton's translation of which is
attached, to Rowton to copy and study. LIRING/3 appeared genuinely shaken
at the revlacion in the second persgraph of the letter,dated 29/12/68,
that the "man on the bicycle" ( Carlos Perzabal) had written in his letter
to Marta that LIRING/3 was "workin for another company (ACIRM) and that
Morte should not enzifie in enthite LITIN/3 mich write t. has
2017
told Rowton that he had suspected that Perzabal had accused him of perhaps
causing the arrest, but he never dreamed that Perzabal would go so far as
to accuse him outright of being a &CPIAM agent.
2. LIRING/3 then speculated that Perzabal could not have done such a series
thing of his ow initiative, but rust necessarily have been inspired by
some outside source, most probably the LIRING establishment. He continued
that he therefore felt it more necessary than ever to put the LIRING Chief
"up against the vall" and force bii to admit his complicity. LIRING/3 added
that he had seen "Rómulo" on 3 January as planned and had told him about
the letter from Marta and Terzabal's treachery. According to LIRING/3
"Rómulo" became indignant and volunteered to accompany LIRING/3 to the
LIRING establishment to have the whole thing out once and for all. LIRING/3
appeared so disturbed at the unexpected news that Rowton found it impossible
to check with him on the exact tire and place he allegedly met "Rómulo" on
Friday, 3/1/69. then Rowton stated that he felt it very important to iden-
tify "Rómulo" positively ( Rowton alleged that he had access to the Gober-
nación "mug file" of persons wanted by the Guatemalan Government and given
to the Mexicans for identification), LIRING/3 volunteered to arrange to
meet "Rómulo" somewhere in public as soon as possible so that koton could
get a good look at him ( as he had prestitiously done in the case of "Garcia").
3. Rowton advised LIRING/3
not under any circumstances to attempt to
lure "Rómulo" to any public place, especially since the latter had estab-
lished a pattern of meeting with him in a safehouse, but simply to tell
Rowton the next time be was invited to visit the safehouse and Rowton would
cover the place from as convenient a spot as possible (e.g. *wooloré's
across the street). Kootcn also encouraged BATING/3 to talk again with
LIRING/9 rahher than the Chief LIRING IN THE bore of more production.

Evelope addressé to Solor Carlos Gurado
Eurifico Cendres L.6

Mexico, 27

Sender's initials: M.3.
Postmarked 16 December, 1968, Guatemala.
Cuszenala, December, 1968.
Dear Carlos:
Excuse as for not having replied to yours of 12 November until today,
but the affairs of the "patojos" keep ce on the go and besides : have
been sick and upset and I keep forgetting everything. That's the reason
I haven't put a date on this letter; you won't believe it but I write
two letters that never get off, but it's true. We hope that you are as
well as ever with your family.
I have to tell you that the "hobre de la bicicleta" wrote ne last week
and that I am a little peeved at in because he speaks ill of you. You
shouic move cautiously, but don't think that it's a problem with us -
we don't believe it. We feel that it's from fear. I lost his address
and for that reason don't intend to write to him.
"El vigotudo" sends you regards; La reza a warn ecrase; la chiquita
a kiss; Elsa.FelisaCari,Varia Elens,Guri and the "patojos" many regares
and embraces for the Chirsmas holidays. The "patojos" are still in the
"pina" so they couldn't come. We'll see whether they can be with us the
24th; if not we'11 have to go there to be with them. In any case I'11 let
you know when they. come here.
So long with many best wishes and congratulations to you and your wife and
children. Excuse the long and boring letter.
So long Carlos,
/s/ Karta

Gautemala, 29.December,1988.
Carlos,
I'a writing this after returinis from the farm where I had a chat with
"los cuchies"; you: three 2000 lettere cano the case day, as well as the
postcard which is very attractive. Tisake for all your trouble. In yours
of the 20th you ask me to send a letter to the "E.C." but I don't utcer-
stand where you mean, and to wher, since I don't recognize those initials.
Please explain to ne clearly what you mean so that I car comply.
As to the letter from the "an on the bicycie", I mislaid it since I didn't
like what it said, but if I can locate it I'11 send it to you, as the
"patojos" told me to from the beginning, so the you can have an exact
account of it. I, however, thouthr the weight they gave to it exaggerated.
In any case he wrote to tell me that you were verking for another company
(201) and for then means I shouldn't confide in anythine that you
with to me. But I's very sincere is that respect and for that reason I
got very angry. Consider this, that when you both were here:, the mother
of that person was very nice to me, lavishing fautery and gifts on c. e,
for which I am sincerely grateful and do not forget, but is action dessst
seen (conest) to :e. he all have to be loyal and faithful to our convictims
and not be shameless with respect to our cormades; we have to be respo-
sible is all our actions.
I haven't been able to write until tcetsy since I's running around tom ar-
ranging things. All this must be boring to you. Receive gretings free
Mucel, chiquita, negra, Yaria, Telisa, zy grandson, Lisita, Ogrditaand
Cari. Also my own "abrazos" and good wishes.
/s/ Karta
Carlos: Lesbia ("La Negrita") sends you fond recenbrances. Excuse the
red pen and the bad handwriting. Imagine! you fooled all of us
since we thought you had rade the Christnas card yourself -since
you peint so well, but you' not going to believe that. I'=
writing you just a few lines because and didn't leave ne such
space. Grestings to your wife and children, even though I haven's
had the pleasure of neeting them. So long,
/s/ Lesbia


Gustenala, 29 December, 1965
Dear Chicai,
This letter is to send you greetin's in the hope that you are well
together with your husband and children.
I was happy to learn that the perses ise wrote to ce was you; it was
quite a practical joke wier : found cut that it was really
Carlos who was writing. Tell his that the letter he sent with the clippings
has not yet been received.
Mary "barazos" and decrements from your friend
/s/ Xarta.
Carlos: I's writing simply to send you =y best wishes for a progricus
and cappy new year.
/s/ Elsa.

Carlos,
I send you as best, wishing that you and your family are well.
Everything here is the same as when you were with us. We learned
that your trip was good in all reasets.
You can settle with the "Chine" the accounts you let' here. Ne's
going to send you two postcards that are very interesting. I trust
you'll appreciate how difficult it was for us to find them anons so
many attractive cards we have here.
You can write to Dca Luisa. Greetings and "haste prento."
lel
The above is one of the many overscists of Dora Luisa. Excuse it.
(Endwritins of Marta)

4. Legal Travelers to PREMEN:
A. LIRING-4: According to LIRING-3, LIRING-4
is in no condition to accept any assignment or
instructions for a trip to PERMEN. There is,
however, soze possibility that LIRING-3 may go to
PREMEN on a "cultural" mission, at which time he
will report directly to PREMEN officials on his
work. The U.S. Department of LIRING-9 has reiterated
that he wants both LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 toire. but
was not suggested dates to this travel. (See
MEXICO CITY-8159 and -8228.
B. LIRENO-2: LIRENO-2's papers are finally
in order, and she has indicated that she is still
willing to travel to PREMEN. However, the recent
work was not a major problem. The U.S. Department
ceration of her son (in a frare-up by his employer -
see MEXICO CITY-8182), has brought her to a physical
and psychological low. The Station is allowing her
time to recuperate before raising the question again.

of LITAMIL-3): Subject has been reapproached about
making a trip to PRBUKEN now that the Olympics are

G. Subject of HEM-35516: The Station is
still planning to have FORTON explore the feasibility
of approaching Subject and using hin as an eventual
source in FERRENE, where, by the nature of his
function, he still maintains contacts. (See
35516.)

on 2 December. Subject was debriefed by a Station
Case Officer on the current status of the relation-
ship of the United States. The Commission, the
Government, and on other requirements given him
before his departure for PERTURE. The most promising
factor in this operation is the fact that four of
his
manufacturers will be comine not from a conference
in April 1969. Subject promised to give the Station
access to any or all of these individuals.
5. Technical Penetration and Coverage of LIRING and the
Residences of LIRING Personnel:
A. UKTRAP in Chief, LIRING's Residence:
MEXICO CITY-7952 reported that the difficulties
of the United States have a LIRISK unit installed
in the LIRKCK-4 LP. The Station made its own LIRISK
installation on 23 November. (See MEXICO CITT-8182.)
All attempts to activate the KIRAP hare so far
been unsuccessful. (See MEXICO CITY-8303.)
B. LYSAVPAN: LISAMPAN coverage of BAKER
continued. EASY was lost on 9 October as a result
of a routine installation in the same building by
the LIRISK company. Attempts to activate LAST from
LISABJ were unsuccessful. (See MEXICO CITT-7598 and
-8239)
C. LIVESTO: LIVESTOY coverage has remained
unchanged. The LIRING Commercial line still has
not been reconnected.
D. LIFET: LIFET coverage of LIRING-21 was
discontinued on 15 'ovenber for security reasons.
The coverage was renewed on 6 December.
E. LIONION: LIONION-1 continued to perform
his photographic and audio duties. His ability now
to identify people by name by monitoring DOG is
particularly useful.
F. LIROSIN: LIROSIN-1 was kept on full salary
during the period. In late November he was given
the assignment of renting a new LP which was spotted
by LITANT-2. He successfully rented this LP on
4 December, after LIRENO-1 laid the groundork, and
will move into it on 18 December 1968. This will
be the base for an audio operation against LIRING-2,
LIRING-9, and LIRIN-15.

period.
LIRING-3/JIRING-4: On 29 October ROSTON

results of the initial debriefing were cabled in
MEXICO CITY-7900. LIRING-3 indicated that LIRING-4
was very nervous and upset, and that he wanted all
his own activity and association with ROWTON to be
kept from her. LIRING-3 has been meeting fairly
frequently with LIRING-9, who has been debriefing
him on his incarceration in Guatemala. (See MEXICO
CITY-5988).
E. SPRUENX Maids: The Station decided to
mount an operation against the PRBUVEN maids, and
selected LIEURACE-3 as a suitable access agent.
(See MEXICO CITY-7861.) The Station is in the
process of turning LIEURIECPC-3 over to LIRALM-1,

normal.
10. Deblic Agents: LISISSY-1 retuned from his European
trip on 17 November and was recontacted by LIRING-9, who
lieved requirements on him as reported in MEXICO CITY-8339.
LISASSY-1 continues to have difficulty satisfying LIRING-9
requests for information on the activities of the PBRUREN
community in Lexico City and M2.1. The CI aspect of the
LISASSY-1 operation was virtually not a set of time for the
LISASSY-1 was not of Mexico; and the Section of the either LIRING-9 or
LISASSY-1 was out of Mexico; and second, the Station has been
unable to come up with information which LISASSY-1 could pass
to LIRING-9. In this last respect, LISISSY-1 continues to be
an excellent channel of WOFIRN-controlled information to the
PRUREN Government via LIRING-9.
11. Operations Against PREUREN Subversive Activities in
Latin America:
12. LIRING-3: See MEXICO CITY-7500 for NORTON'S

Guatemala. MEXICO CITY-7545 reported that LIRING-3
received a letter from Guatemala which he interpreted
as a check on a new comno channel between the
Guaternaln rebels and him. LIRING-3 reported at
length to LIRING-9 on his contacts with FAR members
and the U.S. Department of the National Defense
may send LIRING-3 to PBRUREN to make a personal
report on this. (See MEXICO CITY-8159.) More
detailed reports were forwarded in HEMA-35905.
HEMA-55904 forwarded a report of LIRING-3's imprison-
ment in Guatemala.
13. LIRING-3: The Reports: The PBRUREN letter drops
being covered by the Station only produced one
intercesting letter during this period. (See HEMA-
35873.) The Station suggested that Headquarters
follow up on the lead provided.
C. LIRING-7: LIRING-7 continued to see his
Mexican leftist student "friends" during this period.
(See HEMA-35823.) He also escorted a high-ranking
and anti-theoretical Orthodox Church during a visit to
Mexico. One intelligence dissemination was made on
the basis of information produced by LIRING-7 during
this visit.
D. LIRICK-4: When he was in jail in mid-
November, LIRACK-4 was approached by some Mexicans
arrested in connection with the student disturbances.
He also reported that he had been a very good job for
for their commo, and was asked if he would be willing
to assist them with his has radio equipment for
direct commo between the revolutionaries and PERUEN,
since going through LIRING was not satisfactory.
The Station is taking a wait-and-see attitude to see
how the program was not a good thing.
14. Subject of HEMA-35872: Via LIFET, LIEVTRAP,
and the LIEVTRACES, the Station identified a Mexican
student contact of LIRING. Background information
on this person, including photos, was passed to the

they arrest and interrogate the person. (See HEMA-

CONI. :UATION OF
DISPATCH
DISKET/RYBAT
HIGMA - 36185
would be wasting his time on this case because orders
from an unidentified high Mexican Government official
indicated that the planned charges against the
employee would not be accepted for trial.
3. AMSTET-1. AMSTET-1 sent a letter to the
home of AMSTRTU-8, who in turn notified the Station
to come and pick it up. The contents of the letter
were forwarded to Headquarters in MEXICO CITY-8130.
This is a Headquarters case in which the Station
participates only as a letter drop via AMSTRTU-8.
13. As can be seen, all the above has been previously
reported to Headquarters. In view of this, and the fact that
the PRURVEY Section, in addition, submits regular quarterly
reporting. The Commission's report was prepared by the
on the Station's activities against the PRURVEY targeting
f adequate. Therefore, the Station once more suggests that
formal PRURVEY Section monthly or bimonthly reports be
discontinued. Please advise.

i. Guatemala City agrees that GONZALEZ is apparently the FAR contact
liished for LIRING-3 in Mexico. Néthier or not LIRING ever seeks to

LIRING/3 Report of Meeting with LIRING/9.
1. LIRING/3 reported to Rowton at 0915 on 27/11/65 that he had met with
LIRING/9 at the LIRING establishment from about 1745 until 1900 on 26/11/63.
He stated that he gave LIRING/9 his written report on his recent experiences
in Guatemala and the conclusions be drew from talking with FAR members there.
L/3 also stated that he did his best to assure L/9 that, aithough he sympathized
with the laments of the León Parrios brothers, he was really on the PRUNKEN
side and offered to do all he could to assist theILRINGa in their attempts to
assist the revolutionary forces. The following is Rowton's reconstruction of
the conversation, based on LIRING/3's report:
L/3: "I'm sorry to be late, but I had to finish the report."
L/9: "Alright. I've been waiting here at the gate so there wouldn't
be any further delay. Let's go to my office so we can talk pri-
tely."
Upon entering office, L/9 removes jacket and offers L/3 a seat in the
office.
L/3: "Well, here's my report. I must apologize that it's in rough draft
form. I had to write it rather hurriedly when my wife was not around.
It's really just a series of badly organized thoughts and ideas but
I'll be glad to explain. There's a great deal more, of course, that
I could explain on the subject. Do you wish me to read it?"
L/9: "No, that's alright.
L/9 glances through the report and continues:
"I'11 read it carefully later. I really didn't expect such a long
report. I appreciate it. In the meantime, how are you dobing in your
personal affairs??
L/3: "well, as I told you last time, I'm very much up in the air at the
moment. My exposition has started but is not going as well as can be
expected - as well as I had hoped. You know, these things have their
up's and down's. I'11 sell some things, at least to cover my current
expenses, but I'11 really have to get better organized financially
in the near future. The first problem that I'm really worried about
is my wife, and I frankly feel that I must appeal to you for help.
L/9: "Of course. Well, what is the problem?"
L/3: "As you know, some time ago my wife and I had a series of unpleasant
situations that almost led to a separation.
L/9: "Is that right! "as it that serious?" "anything political?"
L/3: " No, abacutely not. It was purely a domestic misunderstanding. Now

I feel that I must be very frank with you. I was probably responsible

because of an affair I had with him Carmen, - you know, the daughter
of the doctor we just said hello to as we came in, tle one talking with
LIRING/2. "
L/9: "Is that so? I had no ideal"
L/3: "Well I assumed you knew, since Carmen's father is a close friend of
your Chief. in any case, it's over now, and I don't expect any trouble
from that quarter. However, I feel that I should explain that I have
an obligation to my wife for all that she did not me while I was in
jail with no help from anyone, as you well know."
L/9: "Yes, it was difficult for her."
L/3: "You see, my wife is a sincere revolutionary, but she really doesn't
want anv part of the activity that
many others, including my former cell-mate and his famous uncle, who
talk a great revolution, but fall apart when the chips are down."
L/9: "Yes, we know plenty of those types."
L/3: "Well, anyway, my wife wouldn't approve of my reinvolvement and keeps
pressing me to take a "respectable" job which she knows I could obtain
through my friends. that I really want to do is to somehow calm her down
and arrange things so that she won't have any idea of my political plans.
As you know her father is very ill in New York, and she is anxious to
see him before he dies. I can arrange an exposition in Montreal and then
ask the father to come up to see us there. That would get around the
problem of a U.S. visa, which I'a sure neither of us could get."
L/9: "No. I'm sure you couldn't."
L/3: "The only problem is transporta ion. Air passage is too expensive and
unfortunately there are no boats going from here. They all stop at New
Tork. Don't you have regular ship traffic to Montreal, so that we could
go that way?"
L/9: "Yes we do. I'm sure that could be arranged. I see no problem."
L/3: "We could then kill two birds with one stone, by stopping off at the
FARMEN capital enroute."
L/9: "Yes, there's really no problem."
L/9: "I hope you understand my problem. I'm in a very serious way financially
at the moment, and couldn't possibly solve this problem myself without
your help."
L/9: "tell, how are you doing otherwise - I mean in meeting living expenses?"
L/3: "Just getting by. You know we live on a very modest - day to day basis.

"The exposition is not going as well as I expected. But the problem
I'm really concerned about is that of by wife."
L/9: "Let her go to FBRUREN."
L/3: "what do you mean? I don't understand."
L/9: "Well, I mean with you, when you go."
L/3: "Ch, yes, I see. Of course. She can see her relatives and there won't
be a problem. You know my wife was getting pretty desperate about seeing

her father and she even talked of going to the
Northamerican Embassy for a visa so that she could go to New York. Imagine
that! I told it would be no use - just a waste of time since she wouldn
get the visa."
L/9: "For beven's sake, tell her not to go! That would create no end of
in the PECUMEN capital. Calm her downaby all means.
L/3:
"Getting back to my report, as I said, cany points can be expanded."
L/9: "Yes. Let's zee! again on,say, Monday, at a time convenient for you."
L/3:
"You know I have plenty of time row. I'm up in the air, as I said, not
doing much - just the exposition. Cn the other hand you'ra busy man.
You set the time."
L/9:
"I talk about 1000 would be good. Is that okay with you?"
L/3:
"Yes. I'11 be back."
L/9:
"I'm gald you covered the important point as to what the FAR thinks of
us. This is very important to us. Also you say that you expect a contact
with one of them here?"
L/3: "Yes, with a certain 'Pavel' but I don't know when. I am in contact as you
can see. They have been writing me more or less regularly since my de-
parture." ( L/3 takes two letters from pocket and shows them, but L/9
makes no move to take them or read contents.)
L/9: "Well, I'11 be waiting for you at 1000 on Monday."
2. LIRING/3 told Rowton at a subsequent meeting (1100,28/11/6800) that when
he returned home the previous evening, he found to his surprise a note slipped
under the door from LIRING/9 asking him not to forget to come by at 1000 on
Monday, 2 December, 1968.

Subject:
LIRING/3 Report of Activities for the Period 7-13 January, 1969.
1. Rowton met with LIRING/3 at the Camino Real Restaurants at 1000 on
10 and 13 January. He reported the following developments in connection
with the accusations made against his to Harta Barrios de León by
Identity A
(a) On the evening of 8 January, 1969,
Identity B
called on him at his home unannounced and made an effort to
smooth over the hard feelings that had arisen between LIRING/3
and her husband. She denied any knowledge of charges made by
her
and
the
them in any case. when L/3 stated that he had definite proof
in the form of a letter Identity B insisted on seeing it.
L/3 (who had given the original letter to Rowton) atalled pro-
mising to produce the letter on 10 January in the presence of her
husband. L/3 told Rowton that when he attempted to contact Iden B
and her husband by phone on the morning of 10 January, he found
the phone constantly busy and suspects that the receiver was
left purposely off the hock.
(b) On the evening of 12 January, 1969, Arturo Serrano of the CPM,
visited LIRING/3 at his home and to101c him that the Central Com-
nittee of the CPM had discussed his feud with Identity A
in response to the letter LIRING/3 had sent to it alleging that
Iden A was maligning him unjustly. Serrano continued that the
CC of the CPM had found the letter too vague to nask any sense,
but in any case could not take Iden A aersoniously. Serrano told
L/3 that Iden A and Identity B had been recently formally
expelled from the party for ideological reasons, but still had a
number of friends willins to vouth for them. On the other hand
Serrano stated that the CC of the CPM had received information
"some time ago" from the LIRING office alleging that LIRING/3 had
been acting in a suspicious manner, especially with regard to cer-
tain information he had provided concerning Julián Lépes that
"could not have come from a scurse other than the police." Serrano
continued that although the CPM had no love for the LIRING office
it nevertheless had to take such a report into consideration and
the burden of proof was really on LIRIL.G/3.

2.
Serrano, as a friend, advised L/3 to "take the bull by the
horns" and send as much data as possible to defend himself
to all "important progressive" organizations. He volunteered
to pass a copy of the letter from Rarta Barrios to the CPM and
L/3's version of the arrest and detention as soon as he had pre-
pared it.
2. In response to Rowton's query as to any other friends L/3 might have
in the CPM who might be able to obtain a copy of the original letter from
the LIRING Cffice, LIRING/3 recalled that an old acquaintance from Chiapas,
and
re-establish contact with him. L/3 told Rowton that he had known Zepeda
in the PERUNEN capital socie six years previously and recalled that Zepeda
had traveled and studied in Communist China and the Soviet Union before re-
turing to Mexico. Zepeda recently told L/3 that he was employed in CCNASUPO
and that he had written several articles favorable to L/3 in: "Renovaci6n"
a daily newspaper he controlled in Turia-Cutierrez,Chiapas. L/3 told Rowton
that he later learned that the newspaper was actually owned by Hank González,
general director of CONASUPO, who apparently had political ambitions.
3. Rowton suggested that L/3 get in touch with Zepeda not only to determine
why he had recontacted L/3 after so long a time, but to ascertain his current
relationship with the CPM and the LIRING office, if any.
4. LIRING/3 stated that he had not been recontacted by "Rosulo" and proaised
to advise Rowton in advance of a future meeting so that Rowton could cover
it in the hope of getting a good look at the FAR representative.
