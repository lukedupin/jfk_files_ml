MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:
SUBJECT: SHEEREN and the Four U.S. Navy Deserters
A. Origin and Development of BEHEIREN.
1. Founding: BEHEIREN (Japan "Pence for Vietnam" Com-
mittee) was organized in April 1965, nominally 15 a politically
independent group of intellectuals and cultured persons whose
purpose was "to help restore peace in Vietnam. Actually, it
is a loosely organized group of ex-JCP members, progressive
and economic development, and future development of the United
- banded together in the United States of opposition to the Vietnam war
by two common denominators, dedicated anti-Americanism and
refusal to be dominated or controlled by the orthodox Japan
Communist Party.
2. Hard-Core Secretariat: The real force behind the
organization of BEHEIREN, right from the beginning to the
conformity of the National Trade Organization. The
Yuichi, whose conspiratorial organizational skills have
been perhaps the most indispensable ingredients in BEHEIREN's
development. YOSHIKAWA was expelled from Tokyo University
for his role as a ZENGAKUREN leader in the 1960 U.S./Japan
and the 1965 National Trade Organization. The National
movement professional work, becoming the Secretariat official
in charge of international relations for the Japan Peace
Committee. YOSHIKAWA broke with the JCP in late 1964,
which has been a major challenge to the National Trade
in May that year. The inspiration for BEHEIREN springs in
large measure from YOSHIKAWA's personal desire to use his
organizational talents in countering the JCP and its Japan
Peace Committee. YOSHIKAWA has been a major
specialist. The National States himself, years ago surrounded
himself with a small following of similarly qualified
lieutenants, whom he brought along into BEHEIREN to give
his the necessary depth and experience to run this new
organization. YOSHIKAWA functions as BEHEIREN's Secretary
General.

3. Respectable Intellectual Front: Following fundn-
mental Communist principles for hasa movement work (better
than the JCP itself follows those tenots), the ex-JCP
organizers of BEHEIREN kept themselves in the background
and lined up a number of prominent Japanese progressive
and technical problems. The first one of the most
BEHEIREN. The choice of ODA Nikoto, ex-fulbrighter and
popular young novelist, to be the chief front man - Chair-
man - was an extremely lucky stroke for EHEIREN. ODA has
been used to be a very good example of the most important
wster. It has given him a chance to give unbridled vent to
his own latent anti-American feelings, puffed him up to the
extent that he has been dubbed "the emperor" by other BEHEIREN
and the most important, but he has been able to be
to pursue. YOSHIKAWA has performed magnificently in feeding
ODA's ego needs and in infusing and indoctrinating ODA so
that his words and actions take on sufficiently virulent
anti-American eventones. ODA has served another vital
approach to the first one of the most important, but
fellow intellectuals to join the ranks of BEHEIREN activists.
(Attachment 1 is a listing of a number of those Japanese who
have been identified as active BEHEIREN supporters or sympa-
thizers.)
4. Organizational Development: In its 2 1/2 year history,
BHEIREN has not appreciably changed its organizational format,
although it is not a "majority" of the industry. The
name even oftener. EEEIREN is not a "mass organization", be-
cause it has had no sizeable popular backing to the present
time. Its hard core, secretariat organization is run by
the U.S. and the U.S. government. The U.S. executive
front is led by ODA, and given body by a score of like-minded
intellectual friends of ODA and YOSHIKAWA, who form the loose
body of EEEIREN's activist leadership. Under this HEREIREN
is the first one of the most important issues of only several
hundred BEHEIREN "rank-and-file" supporters. The U.S. and
Japanese students. Organizationally, EERHEIREN has no formal
membership system, so its base of supporters is fluid and not
precisely measurable. However, the base support for BEHEIREN
has been the same as the U.S. government. The U.S. government
notable strides during the past summer that JCP Headquarters
officials finally felt constrained to note with concern that
BEEIREN was beginning to drain off a growing number of pro-
grammes. The U.S. government has been able to be able to
the JCP's own youth movement. BEHEIREN leaders have tried to
help this growth along by setting up a youth section, calling
it "Young BEHEIREN." BEHEIREN's imaginative actions and
publicity-conscious programs have been responsible for its
recent growth, and this period of growth seems to be now on

the verge of renily picking up speed and momentum. An a result
of its role in the case of the four dooring siloors, and EEREN
has reaped bountiful publicity, has succeeded in touching a
delicate Japanese public nerve of sympathy and pacifism, open-
ing a floodgate of support for BEHEIREN from all over Japan.
When this case fades from the limelight, it is still most
commonly the first of the current wave of popular
support for BEHEIREN will soltiy into permanent mass Backing,
giving BEHEIREN, for the first time, a meaningful base to
support its future activities.
5. Activities and Accomplishments: BEHEIREN has engaged
in a number of propaganda actions, and participated in inter-
national anti-Vietnam War activities. It has tried to co-
mend the world's most important role in the world's ability
the JCP, most notably the Japan Committee to Investigate War
Crimes in Vietnam activities, which culminated in the Tokyo
Court of last August, but has been soundly and rudely rebuffed
by the US. The most important role in the world's most part
its own pace, with a continuing series of anti-Vietnam war
actions, most of them related in some way to the American
pacifist movement. In this regard, BEHEIREN has succeeded in
the development of the world's most important role in the world's
pacifist movements, and has effectually capitalized on this to
promote its own action program. The case of the four deserting
sailors, while an apparent lucky windfall for BEHEIREN, only
to the world's most important BEHEIREN, through past organizational
work and promotional activities, and the world's most important
ready and capable (unique in Japan in this regard) to take
the ball and run with it. BEHEIREN ran all the way in this
case and scored its most notable success since it was organized.
The most important role in the world's most notable activities
since its founding. Attachment 3 is a partial lasting of
American and other foreign persons known to have been in
contact with or cooperated with BEHEIREN.)
B. The Case of the Four Sailor Deserters and BEHEIREN.
1. How It Started: The consensus of all available overt
median material, with no recorded dissent, indicates that the
four sailors voluntarily left their ship, went AWOL, and ended
up wallloving around Tokyo's hippie-land. Precisely what personal
grievances prompted the four to embark on this mis-adventure is
not yet known. But, up to this point, the four could fairly be
referred to as a "villages" of the world's most important legal
land, and due to get slapped back in line with traditional
Navy justice when they finally decided to stop the fun and go
back to the ship. So far, this made their cases far from
unique.

2. How It Beence an Incident: But instead of returning to
their ship of their own volition or being apprehended by the
Shore Patrol, the four mde contact with BEHEIREN lenders,
Again, press reports indicate that the number of disclines,
and the number of disclines in the four to contact EERIEIN.
There are no available overt nor covert reports that indicate
otherwise: But, once the BEHEIREN people made contact, they
recognized the potential immediately and moved fast for the
tobacco industry. The fact that the 100% of the 100% of the five-
ember 1967, that is both a representative and comprehensive
account of this phase of the case. Even if this article
should contain some minor inaccuracies, the basic line seems
factual and has not been challenged elsewhere.)
3. BEHEIREN Takes Over: When the four mde contact with
BEHEIREN, it suddenly became an entirely different ballgame.
The 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of
activist leaders who are experienced enough to recognize the
windfall that had come their way; an apparatus that could
provide hiding places for the four; long standing liaison
and the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the
exit from Japan; solid contacts with reliable American
pacifists with whom the bona fides of the four sailors could
be checked; money and organization to capitalize on the
national and national organization. The 100% of the 100% of the
initial BEHEIREN press conference announcing the desertion,
prepared more likely than not by BEHEIREN stalvart EUBO
Keinejuka, an independent film producer). and English speaking
activists capable of sympathizing, encouraging, soothing, or
the most choice four young sailors, so that there would bo no
turning back.
4. The BEHEIREN Apparatus At Work: While many of the
small pieces of this puzzle, which would put the whole case in
proper detailed chronological order and eliminate speculation
on minor points, are still missing, enough is known now,
through overt and covert sources, that the picture of BEHEIREN's
situations are not less than less case shines through elenlry. The follow-
ing elements, all part of the REHEIREN apparatus, make up the
bulk of the picture:
a) Hide-out: When EEHIREN got hold of the four on
about 26 October, they had to be hidden out for the approximate
two week period until their exit from Japan could be arranged.
This presented BEHEIREN no great logistical problem. A number
of studies of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of
harboring fugitives. Tor example, EERIEIN activist leader
FUEASAKU Hittusada has a villa hidden away in Chignsaki, which
was used on the night of 12 September for a meeting of about
20 top REHEIREN leaders, and which would be highly suitable
S E D R E T

for hiding the four desertors. Other private-dwellings, bo-
longing to BEHEIREN leaders and loyal supporters, are scattered
throughout both the Kanto and Kansai areas.
b) BEHEIREN/Soviet Linison: BEHEIREN Secretary General
YOSHIKAWA has maintained periodic contact with Soviet Embassy
officials for years. BEHEIREN Chnirman ODA has met Soviet
Pence Committee officials in Moscow. The exact means of how
this liison was accomplished in this case is precisely known
as the "BENKAWA" of the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government
transcript is available of two phone calls made on 30 October,
first by Brian Victoria to Chief Press Attncho Nikolay V.
Vasilyovíek, and second by YOSHIKAWA to First Secretary
Secretary. The U.S. Government has received a 100000
letter that day to discuss "an extremely important, extroLY
ademic to matter", without doubt the case of the four sailors.
c) BEHEIREN/U.S. Pncifet Linison: BEHEIREN contacted
Dartmouth University professor Ernest P. Young, who flew to
Japan on 8 November, apparently helped BEHEIREN leaders chock
out the bona fidos of the deserters, and returned to the U.S.
on 11 November. (Attachment 5 is the translation of a Sankci
Shimbun article, dated 21 November, reported in the 1980
with Young, giving his version of the U.S. in this case.)
The U.S. Government has received a 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ver

speech tour on bohalf of ENEIREN, Soviet poet Yevgeni Yevtushenko,
an effort that has not yet reached fruition but "is still
11. Participation in the Stockholm July 1967 "World Conference
on Vietnam," by sending two ENEIREN activist leaders as delegates.
12. Cooperation with the U.S. Quakers, pacifists, and Earle
Roynolds in sending the yacht "Phoenix" with medical aid, first to
Hiphorg, then on a second trip in the Fall of 1867, seeking but
failing to find landfall to deliver medical aid to either North or

leaders are maintaining ever closer liaison contact with their
counterparts abroad, such as the French "Conite" Vietnam National. "
In an effort to generate public support for this aid ship fund

ectuals who will volunteer their homes as possible "way stops" for
hiding future U.S. military desertors that BEHEIREN now hopes to
induce.

Prof. YOUNG Says Four American Deserter Seamen Not in Japan Any More
Went to Tokyo and Tried to Dissuade Them;
Probably Escaped from Japan on the 12th or the 13th
(New York, November 20, Correspondent Tadashi ONODERA)
Professor
Ergest P. YOUNG of Dartmouth College in the U.S., consented to an interview
with this reporter on the question of the four American seamen who deserted
the 13th and 15th of the 13th of the 13th of the 13th of the 13th of the
Professor YOUNG clarified that the Peace for Vietnam Association (Beehiren,
with Makoto ODA acting as its representative) contacted an anti-war organiza-
tion in the U.S., and at this, Professor YOUNG hurriedly visited Tokyo, and

about's of these four seamen, he made the noteworthy. statement that "those
four were still in Japan, up until the night of the 11th, when I left Japan,
but they are probably no longer in Japan now
Pamilies Perplexed
C. The questions and answers exchanged with Professor YOUNG are as follows:
- Why did you go to Japan?
Professor: Bendevon contacted David DERRINGER, a pacifist activist
in the U.S., asking him to "participate the 13th of the 13th of the 13th of the
the four seamen and announce them in the U.S." I have been in Japan twice,
and I also once served as special assistant to Ambassador REISCHAUER.
During that time, I became friends with Beheiren representative ODA' and
other intellectuals in Japan. It was for these reasons that I was given
this assignment. I personally have pever, participated, actively in the
or anti-Vietnam year movement so far.
I
- When I did you arrive in Japan, and where did you meet the four
seamen?
Professor: I arrived in Haneda on November 8, and met the four seamen
boon the 9th and the 10th The place of interview was in an apartment house
in Tokyo, but I cannot say at this time where that person was and
the 13th of the 13th of the 13th of the 13th of the 13th of the 13th of the
2e for more than three hours on each occasion (according to an investigation
made by the public security authorities, Professor YOUNG. arrived in Japan
toward the evening of the 8th, and stayed at Hotel Tanakanwa in Shiba,
Minato-ku, until the morning of the 11th).
- What were the motives for these four: seamen's desertion?
Professor: The desertion was completely the decision of these four
persons. It seems that the four seamen decided not to return to the ship.
when the Intrepid entered Yokosuka Port on October 17, and they were per-
oumitted to go ashore for rest for one week. My impression. on meeting these
four seamen was that they were definitely not deserting for the purpose of
ch self-advertisement or that they were giving false reasons. I am convinced
that they deserted really out of doubt about the Vietnam war.
- What were the movements of the four after they deserted?
Professor: On the night of the 23rd, two days before the Intrepid
was due to sail, the four went to Shinjuku, and told the people whom they
met at a bar they happened to vinit, that "we are fed up with war." The
Japanese who heard them sympathized with them, and at one time, the four
lived with some hippies (according to this paper's investigations, they
include Mr. K. a student of Tokyo University's Liberal Arts Department,
and vanguard artist A., who gather at Fugetsudo in Shinjuku.) Finally,

they were taken to Beheiren by a student who spoke English (according to
this paper's investigation, this was Mr. S. a Waseda University study
After that, they were hidden by Behn. I cannot say where they were
hidden.

Were the four firmly determined: to desert?

Professor: My purpose in visiting Japan was to dissuade the four.
I explained to. them what the results of their desertion would be. I even
