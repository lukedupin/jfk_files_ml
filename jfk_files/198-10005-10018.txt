General:
Arms amuggling is one of the "facts of life" in Latin
America and has been engaged in by dissident elements for many years.
Reports of Castro invoivement in these activities have been frequent since
shartrly after his aciature of power early in 1959. None of these reports
has over been proven. With the arrival of large quantities of Soviet Bloc
arms in 1961, Cuba recovered all U.S. arms in the hands of the populaee
and made it a crime punishable by death to have possession of weapons of
U.S. manifecture. The U.S. arms furnished under the MAP to former Cuban
goversements together with those collected by Castro provide the Castro
government with large stocks which could be shipped to universe groups
in other countries. Identification of these arms with Cuba would be
entrenably difficult.

An extra cache of weapons and ammunition recently discovered at the
Ligas Componessas guerrilla training center in the interior of the
Brazilian state of Goias is believed by US Embassy and CAS officers to
be of Brazilian rather than Cuban arms, despite a Resilien newspaper
suggestion that they were Cuban. There were also discovered about 125
copies of Communist publications including Che Guevara's well-known
treatise on "Guerriila Warfare". The training center was described as
organized according to that book. A confidential report on the discoveries
added that "members of the center want to be the Brazilian equivalent
of those who fought in the Sierra Mestre and so bring the hard Chinese-
Cuban type revolution to Brazil." Some 90 to 95 persons in the locality
are reported members of or sympathetic to the Ligas Componessas activities,
but only 2 of the 24 for whom warrants were issued have yet been taken
into custody. (Am Emb, Rio de Janeiro 1122, 10 December, CONFIDENTIAL,

1.
Soviet fishing boats, under cover of fishing Atlantic waters,
are transporting contraband arms to Latin American countries.
The boats are met outside the territorial waters of those
countries, and arms are transferred in small quantities.
On board the Soviet boats are only Soviets and a very few
of the boats. The boats are not used in the world. The
pick up the arms. The arms being delivered are of American
manufacture, including those obtained during the Batista
regime and those taken during the Playa Giron invasion. The
Soviet fishing boats also carry propaganda. and pamphlets
containing military instructions, the same type of material
being sent by diplomatic pouch from Mexico.
2. A Belgian American Society he represents a Belgian firm,
and the British of the Cuban Government any type and nationality
of arms for payment in dollares. The Belgian has made a
similar offer of sale of arms to a representative of an
anti-Castro group in Habana.
3. In August 1962 a fisherman in Santiago de Cuba said that
on several occasions he had been forced by the Government
to use his boat for transporting small groups of men, in
civilian clothes, and supplies of arms. He also said that
other fishes were not in the same time. The men
were carried to small islands or transferred to other
boats at sea. Such trips sometimes lasted as long as four or
five days. The fisherman did not know the purpose or final
destination of the men and arms.

Venezuela Uncovers Communist Arms Cacne
The Venezuelan Government -- in a raid on a small
village near Caracas on 5 January -- uncovered a
large cache of arms and equipment which it claims
belonged to the pro-Castro Armed Forces of National
Liberation, reputed to be emerging as a para-
military arm of the Venezuelan Communist Party.
Several tons of explosives and large quantities
of hand bombs, arms, and ammunition were seized as well
as a nearby clandestine Communist radio
transmitter. (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM)

ARMS SHIPMENTS
12 Feb 63 "All the information available to Her Majesty's Government
and to the British authorities in British Quiana indicates that there is
no truth whatever in the continuing reports that arms are being shipped
to the colony from Cuba. Similar stories have appeared from time to time
in the past, but upon examination all have been found to be without
foundation."

The British consul in Santiago de Guba has informed Washington
and the Governor of British Guiana that two alleged US citizens,
John Allrem Johnson, aged 53, and his wife Margeret Frances Johnson,
were leaving Cuba on 31 December on the Cuban vessel BANTA DE TANAMA
destined for Georgetown, British Guiana. On board with them were 17
cases in their name, including two large wood crates understood to be
"very similar to those recently unloeded from a Soviet Union ship
in Santiago de Cuba. The British conaul notes the unlikelihood of
US citizens' leaving Cuba in this manner, and the resulting doubt as to
their real identities and intentions. (British Foreign Office to
Washington, No. 9759, 31 December, 1962 (SECRET))

I was advised by a Cuban merchant marine officer that the Cuban freighter,
"Bahia de Nipe" left Cuba for British Guiana on 22 Dec 1961 with a cargo
shipment of weapons. The boxes containing this equipment were stored
in the bottom of the ship's hold and covered with mattresses and canvas.
A cargo of sugar bags was placed on top of the weapons.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION
SOURCE:
US national, executive in a US aluminium company.
Source has frequently traveled to and within British Guiana in connection
with geological surveys for his company. He uses known Jagan for about
nine years, and on his latest trip had several conversations with Jagan.
1.
On the basis of many conversations with Guiana (mostly concerning
possible investments by my company in British Guiana), I am convinced
that he is not a Communist. In fact, Jagan goes not know what he is.
He is simply looking for anything even that will help to pull up its
people quickly. In this context he sees Soviet and Chinese Communis
as a source for principal Thentietn Century economic experiments -- and as
the U.S. Government has is willing to try them.
2.
In talking with Jagan has made clear that he is not a "Castro Type."
He wants help from the U.S. one stating that might in the future
seriously minder his getting outside and from the USER is that he
demands that aid be without stringent.
3.
Both Jagan and its Trade Midacter, Frank Hubbard, gave told we that
Jagan would hesitate to do anything (such as confiscating foreign pro-
parties in an attempt to increase revenues) which would offend the US
or the UN for fear of ruining any fuburs chances of obtaining US or UN
and that the U.S. state is a social social basis for the U.S. in order to
and that the U.S. state is a social social for the to expropriate anything.
After British Guiana achieves independent of the U.S. state, the U.S. state
not expropriate anything if he is getting aid from the US or the UN --
that is, until the money is spent. If at any point (after independence)
Jogan is receiving no such aid and has no prospects of receiving such
welfare. He is a member of the U.S. local, however, cheaper this somewhat
expressing estimate of Jagan by consulting that in 1953 when he entered
office, he was something of a wilin- or a fassie fassie without direction.
Since then he has matured considerable interest.
4.
The PPP capability for increasing the industrial wealth of British
Guiana is hopeless. Jagan indiscriminately wants all kinds of factories.
His "Five Year Plan" is no plan at all. In his eagerness to do something
5
for British Guiana, Jagan thinks he ought to build any kind of factory
industry. He is currently does not have. Whenever he thinks of something, he
just tells you to do what it to the Plan. But there is no one in
the Jagan government who does on can do the market research, etc.,
which is necessary for any such investment.

5.
In the last elections Japan ordered some of his (Indian) Peoples
Progressive Party (PPP) supporters to join the United Front Farty
(UTP) in order to impress the world in general and the US in particular
the United States in British Guiana was working. By virtue of the fact
that the UPP membership was "growing," it was "obvious" that Jagan
was not a dictator. I was told this by two Indian Guianess who were
working for Jagan.
6.
I was in British Guiana for about 12 months on my latest trip.
Since much of this time was devoted to geological surveying in the
hinterland, I was accompanied by an Indian Guianese doctor. A well-
supervised study of the UPP was conducted in the UPP. The UPP
being smuggled into the country from Cuba. He did not go into any
detail on the subject, but he did mention that his sons, who were
members of the Progressive Youth Organization (FPO) frequently brought
arms into their home, kept them for a while, and then disposed of them.
The doctor was so much concerned -- and pessimistic. He said that
the UPP was not a subject to the UPP. They are not fully attended.
7.
Malaria is not a factor now. Even well into the interior there is
less than 1 percent incidence. But anywhere away from the coast
filariasis presents a problem. At first I did not believe it when my
Indian Guianese doctor said that mosquito bites incurred in the day-
time were harmless but mosquito bites at night would infect with
the UPP. The UPP was not a subject to the UPP. The UPP him.
The disease seems to affect women more than men, causing women's legs
to swell. But the disease's affect on men's sexual organs was not
exactly encouraging. - I never-did understand why, but my doctor said
that to be effective in detecting the disease a blood test must be
made at night (preferably between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m.), and analyzed
quickly. If filiriasis is treated promptly, a man's sexual prowess
were used. We found that the disease is very common throughout
the country.

The CIA station in Rio de Janeiro has reported that some efforts
may be made to put pressure on President Goulart to publicly take some
note of the Cuban intervention in Brazil's internal affairs, allegedly
shown by some 16 pages of Spanish-language documents found in the
Variç plane crash which carried a Guban delegation to their deaths in
November. The documents are considered by a Brazilian source who made
them available to the CIA station to be "explosive, since they prove
the Cubans are sponsoring revolution in Brazil. " Paraphrases of these
documents have appeared in the Idms press; but it is unlikely that
President Goulart will give any support to publicizing them. (CIA,

Ex tre mist And Police Activities In Venezuela Venezuela has been afflicted over the past several months with a rash of Castro- Communist terrorist actions.  Many incidents, involving shootings and robberies, are connected with the Movement of the Revolutionary Left,  the Venezuelan Communist Party, and the Armed Forces of National Liberation- the Castro- Communist group credited with the destruction at the Maracaibo oil fields during the Cuban crisis. These activities are probably designed to discredit and weaken the Betan-  court Government.  The police have demonstrated considerable proficiency in preventing major outbreaks and in acting rapidly to arrest terrorists. They have rounded up extremists responsible for the holdup and looting of a printing supply warehouse and the burning of the Dupont paint warehouse and have captured the Communist leader of guerrilla bands operating in the Falcon area of northwestern Venezuela.

TOP SECRET
COMMUNIST ORGANIZATION FOR LATIN AMERICA
Information on the Communist apparatus for Latin America and its
relationship with Cuba and the Sino Soviet Bloc is largely derived from
highly classified intelligence which is provided separately. From the
reports contained in this section, it may be concluded that the organiza-
tional links vary from country to country depending upon, among other
factore, the legal status of the Communist party, whether diplomatic
representation is located in a country, the relative strength of Communist
alliances with other leftist or opposition parties, and the character of
current government leadership in these countries. Next attached is an
unclassified report prepared in October for release as a White Paper.
Although this paper was not released due to the missile crisis, it repre-
sents en agreed summary (State, DOD, CIA and USIA) of the Communist
apparatus in Latin America. The report contains briefs on Communist
activities in each of the Latin American countries.
The reports vary with respect to the country priority for Castro/
Communist action in Latin America. Brazil, Venesuela, and British Guiana
are mentioned most frequently as the likely priority targets. There are
also conflicting reports on the relative independence of Castro from the
Soviet Union and indications that the publicized Sino Soviet disagreements
are reflected in local Communist organizations throughout Latin America.

MEMORANDUM:
Cuban Subversion in Other Latin American Countries
I.
General Summary
1.- The Castro regimes denies that material support is being given
any anti-regime group outside Cuba. Castza claims that such assistance is
unnecessary since the people of these countries, thanks to Cuba's example,
are becoming aware of their revolutionary potential. The publicly stated
position of the Cuban leaders is that their country, "the first socialist
state in America," has become the example, the "beacon". In fact, however,
Cuba's moral and material support to Communist and Communist-influenced
groups has been felt in varying degrees in every ceme of the 19 other Latin
American republics. The Castro regimes has becomes an effective instrument
of the Sino-Soviet effort to weaken and eventually destroy democratic
political institutions in Latin America.
2. Cuban subversion has become more subtle since 1959, when a Cuban-
mounted expeditionsry force was launched against the Dominican Republic and
suller "invasion forces" left Cuba for abortive attacks on the governments
of Panama, Nicaragua, and Haiti. Now Cuban subversive efforts generally fall
in three categories:
8.
The indéctrination and training of hundreds of Latin
Americans in Cuba;
b.
The intensive propaganda beamed at Latin America by Cuban
radio stations and circulated through printed material and
the Cuban-subsidized international "news" agency, and;
c.
The covert material support given subversive groups in
other countries.
II.
Cuban Subversive Programs
A.
Training of Latin Americans in Cuba:
3.
Fidel Castro announced on 9 June 1961 that his government would
grant 1,000 scholarships to "poor students" from other Latin American
countries for the next school term and 100 scholarships to students from
other countries of the world: Hundreds of young Latin Americans have been
subjected to Communist indoctrination. In addition to whatever formal
training they receive in Cuba, many of them receive training in guerrilla
warfare and other techniques of revolution.
4.
Cuban refugees who have arrived recently in the United States have
provided detailed information on the training programs offered to some of
these young Latin Americans.
NW 50955 DocId:32423736 Page 59


a. One refugee, a deserter from Castro's army, reported from
personal knowledge that in late 1961 there were a number of students from
Chile, Eauador, Argentina, Guatemala, and Brazil living in a Havana suburb
who regularly attended classes in Marziem-Leninism, propaganda techniques,
and other subjects to prepare them for active revolutionary roles in their
homelands. He reported that those male students who were between 16 and 20
years of age were sent as part of their training to the Minas del Frio
training center in Oriente province. During this phase of their training they
received familiarization in the use of small arms and hiked to the top of
Cuba's highest mountain, Picc Turquino, in the Sierra Meststra, the locale of
Castro's guerrilla varfoure against the Batista dictatorship.
b. Another refugee, who lived in Oriente province, learned from
conversations with militia-am in the area and from Latin Americans training
there that continuous training of students from other Latin American countries
is going on at Las Arenas, Oriente. The trainees receive instruction in
military tactics, guerrilla, varfure, subversion, sabotage, propaganda, and
Communist ideology. The refugee died not know now many Latin Americans were
involved, but believed the duration of each course was about eight weeks, after
which another group replaced the one that had been training.
5. Much of the travel of Latin American students to Cuba for training
and indoctrination is handled by the Instituto Cubano de Animalad con los
Pueblos (ICAP - Cuban Institute for Friendship with Peoples).
6. Cuba is also a major takeoff point for Latin Americans traveling to
and from the Sino-Soviet bloc. Over 400 Latin Americans returned from last
July's Communist-sponsored Youth Festival in Helsinki aboard a Soviet passenger
vessel with the 400-man Cuban delegation. They disembarked in Havana and
stayed in Cuba some weeks before some of them began returning to their home
countries. Others may well be remaining in Cuba for some time.
B. Cuban Propaganda:
7. International broadcasts by Cuban radio stations maintain a
relatively constant propaganda level at all times, with regularly scheduled
and special broadcasts to specific countries as well as general transmissions
to all of Latin America. The general theme of all these broadcasts is
that "the Cuban example" is awakening the "people" of Latin America to
the opportunity for revolutionary action against the "corrupt"regimes in
power and against "Yankee imperialism" which allegedly supports them.
8. There are regular programs beamed by Hayeans radio to Nicaragua,
the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Peru, and Honduras. They are all
subversive in content and frequently incite to rebellion. These programs
to specific countries are apparently directed and produced with the
guidance of eriles from the countries concerned resident in Cuba.
2
NW 50955 DocId:32423736 Page 60


9. The program to the Dominican Republic, for instance, is announced
as the program of the Dominican Liberation Movement (MID), and the program
is entitled Patricia Libre. At present, Radio Havens beens the 20 minute
Patria Libre program to the Dominican Republic on Thursdays and Saturdays.
Just prior to the program, the Radio Havens announced explains that the
station is making its facilities available to the MLD for its program.
There are some areas in the Dominican Republic where, due to the absence
of local radio stations, the Cuban broadcasts are the only ones heard.
Last July, the subversive content of these broadcasts to the Dominican
Republic led the Dominican government to protest to the Organization of
American States.
10. The content of such broadcasts in exemplified in the stated goals
of the "Voice of Revolutionary Niservagus, the program which is regularly
beamed by Radio Havens to Nicaragua. On 31 August this program celebrated
its first anniversary by repeating its original statement of its purposes:
"The Voice of Revolutionary Niservagus has set itself the goal
of contributing to pointing out the real way to Nicaragua's
liberation from the dominion of Yankee imperialism and the
Somaze tyranny. Elections (scheduled for next February to
choose President Sonzo's successor) with the Somozas in power,
and under the State Department's economic and political centrol
of Niservagus, will be a farce. Without. a prior revolutionary
overthrow of the Sonosa tyranny there can be no free elections
in Nicaragua nor can a popular government be established. This
program will be at the service of the revolutionaries and
against the electioneers. The Voice of Revolutionary Niservagus
will defend the Cuban revolution because it is an important
part of the Latin American people's liberating revolution."
11. Cuban propaganda is also disseminated through the offices of
Presaa Latine, the Cuban-subsidized international "news agency" which
has close working relations with TASS, the New China News Agency, and other
propagende media for the Sino-Soviet bloc.
12. Cuban printed material is circulated throughout the hemisphere;
the Guevara's book on guerrilla warfare has received wide distribution.
Periodically, the Mexican government, most recently last August, has been
obliged to confiscate large quantities of propaganda materials from Latin
Americans passing through that country enroute from Cuba to their homelands.
C. Cuban covert support for subversive groups:
13. Cuban covert support for Communist or pro-Communist groups in
other Latin American countries is provided in a number of ways. In the five
Latin American countries where Cuban diplomatic missions are still resident
(Mexico, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, and Bolivia), these missions have often
been the channel. The Cuban embassy in Mexico is known to have provided
3
NW 50955 DocId:32423736 Page 61


frequent assistance to exiles from Guatemala, Nicaragua, and other Central
American countries living in Mexico. In other instances, assistance is
provided through travelers coming from Cube and through Presse Latina
representatives.
14. The assistance is usually financial. The Cuban's appear to have
been careful since 1959 to avoid being caught in a blatant act of subversion
that could be used to justify concerted inter-American action. Financial
assistance is often just as useful and much less risky than actual weapons
deliveries. In a number of American countries, small arms and other weapons
are available for a price. Unscrupulous or careless arms dealers in the US
have also contributed to the arms traffic from which pro-Castro groups have
benefitted, directly or indirectly.
15. As the following country-by-country rundown indicates, Cuban support
for subversive activity has affected in varying degrees every one of the 19
other Latin Amer ban countries.
a. Argentina: Ernesto "Che" Guevara, an Argentine by birth,
har retained into deep interest in Argentina's political affairs. On 25 May,
the Argentine national holiday, he addressed the group of Argentine citizens
resident in Cuba and told them that he hoped that next year they would be
celebrating in Argentine under "the flag of socialism." At another point
in this address he said: "Our revolution is one which needs to expand its
ideas and other people are helping us. Let the other peoples of the hemisphere
get angry and take up arms or seize power and aid us in this task which is
the task of the entire hemisphere and of humanity."
The Argentine community in Cuba last April organized the
"Cuban-Argentine Friendship Institute" with headquarters in Revana. One
of the leaders is John William Cooke, who was for a time chief of former
Argentine dictator Peron's political machine in Argentina. Cooke continues
active in that faction of the Peronista party which seeks concerted action
with the Argentine Communists. Cooke maintains regular contact with sympathizers
inside and outside Argentina through travelers and through his wife,
Alicis Eugren de Cooke, a resident of Montevideo, Uruguay, who apparently
has regular means of communication with individuals in Argentina. Argentine
citizens have been recruited through this channel to go to Cuba for training.
There are also strong indications that terrorist activities by Argentine
Peronists and Communists have been encouraged and perhaps assisted through
this channel.
Filo
Prior to the diplomatic break between Argentina and Cuba
last February, the Cuban embassy in Buenos Aires provided financial assistance
to anti-government groups there. An Argentine journalist who has contacts in
the Communist party there reported last December, for instance, that the
Argentine Communist party had received the sum of 50,000 pesos from the
Cuban embassy as a contribution to the railway workers who were then on
strike in the province of Cordoba.
4
NW 50955 DocId:32423736 Page 62


Though the (uban embassy is no longer in Buenos Aires, Cuban
clandestine assistance to Argentine Peronist-Communist groups continues. On
19 July of this year the federal police in Buenos Aires reported the un-
earthing of a center of Communist and Peronist activities in the capital.
Two Buenos Aires policemen were shot and killed at a suburban warehouse in
June. Investigations revealed that a quantity of explosives and propaganda
were stored in the warehouse. The trail led to the arrest of one Jose
Maris Aponte, a journalist and known Peronist activist, and one Mario
Massi, owner of the firm which owned the warehouse. It was revealed that
Massi had been maintaining contact with Cuban Communists, with John William
Cooke, and with an unidentified woman associated with the Cuban embassy in
Uruguay who was probably Alicia Egunen de Cooke referred to above. According
to the Argentine police investigation, some 150 Argentine citizens had been
sent from Argentina to Cuba (through Uruguay and Mexico) for training in
guerrilla warfare. On their return to Argentina, these men were to be used
in planned activities in the provinces of Formose, Tucuman, Salta, and the
wooded areas of eastern Argentina. A number of other individuals were appre-
hended by the Argentine police in connection with the subversive activity
revealed in these investigations.
b. Bolivia: Bolivia has been the recipient of special Cuban
attentions. The number of Bolivians receiving "scholarships" in Cuba this
year--between 130 and 150-- appears disproportionately high. The Bolivian
government felt obliged to request the departure of Cuban Ambassador Tabares
in 1960 and of Cuban Charge Garcia Trians in 1961 for blatant intervention
in internal Bolivian affairs, including support for Bolivian Communities and
attempts to incite extremes leftist members of the governing MUR party to leave
the party. In June 1961, the Bolivian government published a series of
documents linking the Cuban embassy with a Communist conspiracy to seize
control of the government. One of these documents, a statement by an arrested
Bolivian agitator who had been in close contact with the Cuban embassy,
gave the names of a number of Bolivians who had received financial support
from the Cuban embassy. This evidence was used to justify the request for
the Cuban charge's recall.
The present Cuban charge in Bolivia, Ramon Aja, has also been
active though perhaps a bit more discreet than his predecessors. He has
been particularly energetic in cultivating relations with Bolivian campesinos.
The peasant union in the Clisa Valley of Bolivia has been reported to be the
recipient of Cuban financial assistance.
c. Brazil: During the pasttwo years the Castro regime has
developed increasingly close ties with Francisco Juliao, self-proclaimed
Marxist and leader of the Peasant Leagues in the troubled northeast region
of Brazil. Juliao, whose wife and children are resident in Cuba, has
traveled there on several occasions, and a number of his essociates and rank -
and-file members of the Leagues have gone to Cuba for agricultural
training which is undoubtedly heavily larded with ideological indoctrination.
Transportation direct from northeast Brazil to Cuba has been provided by
Bubana airlines on at least one occasion. Circumstantial evidence strongly
suggests that Juliao has received financial assistance for his movement from
the Cuban government. Brazilian Communist leaders have privately stated, in
5
NW 50955 DocId:32423736 Page 63


feet, that Juliaoo's Fessant Leagues have received not only money but also
shipments of small arms from Cuba. These Brazilian Communist leaders also
said that the reason Juliaoo sent his family to Cuba vas his fear that they
might be endangered in the civil war he expects to erupt shortly in Brazil.
The Cuban government has also during the past year cultivated
particularly close relations with leaders of the dissident Communist Party
of Brazil (CPE). One of the CPE leaders who had visited Cuba last May
told a friend of a long conversation he had had with Fidel Castro in late
May. Castro expressed identity of feeling with the dissident Brazilian
Communists and criticized the regular Communist party for its failure "to
take a strong revolutionary line" in accordance with the decision of the
22nd party congress of the Communist party of the Soviet Union. Castro
approved the insurrectionary policy of the CPE and urged the leaders to
organize guerrilla activities and start the revolutionary movement in Brazil
"as soon as possible." Castro advised them that government reprisals against
revolutionary action in Brazil would serve only to increase popular dis-
content in Brazil and swell the ranks of the revolutionaries. He advised
CPE leaders to give special emphasis to securing aswride a base as possible
among agricultural workers and the inhabitants of rural areas.
The Cuban embassy in Rio de Janeiro, like Cuban embassies
elsewhere in Latin America, has been a source of assistente to Communist and
pro-Communist elements. Last May leaks to the Brazilian press reported dis-
cussions in the Brazilian cabinet on the subversive activities being directed
by Cuban ambassador Joaquin Hernandez Armaa. The Navy and Army Ministers are
reported to have expressed particular concern over Hernandez' activities.
d. Chila: Senator Salvador Allende, leader of Chile's
Communist-dominated popular front and a leading presidential aspirant, has
made at least two trips to Cuba.
The Cuban embassy in Santiago is the source of propaganda
suyi ort for pro-Communist groups, mostly those associated with Allende, who
are intent on coming to power in Chile through elections or revolution.
Orlando Prendes, cultural attache of the Cuban embassy, is known to be super-
vising the printing of Cuban propaganda on a clandestine printing press in
the home of Julio Bocemegra, who also prints propaganda for the Chilean
Communist party. This activity has been going on for some time. As long
ago as Aggust, 1961, Chilean officials investigating political agitation
and resulting unrest in the Salamanca ares learned that after a visit to the
area by a Cuban diplomat the previous month, pro-Cuban propaganda was being
distributed in the area, and Communists and pro-Communists there were saying
"The mountains of Selamanca are going to be the Chilean Sierra Maestra."
Last March, when Cuban Minister of Education Armando Hart
went to Chile for an international conference he took with him several seeks
of propaganda.
e. Colombia: The United Front for Revolutionary Action (RAA),
organized early this year by Colombian extremists, is believed to have
received financial assistance from Cuba to promote its objective of creating
a guerrilla movement aimed at the overthrow of the government. A Colombian
6
NW 50955 DocId:32423736 Page 64


citizen who has contacts among FUAR numbers reported last June that Fidel
Castro had just given the group $15,000 and promised further financial
aid semi-annually. Gloria Gaitan de Valencia, the wife of a FUAR leader
and the daughter of the Colombian leader Gaitan whose asassination in
1948 sparked the disastrous Bogota rioting, is a long-time personal friend
of Fidel Castro. He has visited Cuba frequently and probably returns to
Colombia with specific advice and assistance from the Cuban government.
The FUAR has succeeded in drawing members from the extremist wing of the
regular Colombian Communist party who are dissatisfied with that party's
reluctance to engage in ipen revolutionary action.
f. Costa Rica: The small Costa Rican Communist party, the
Popular Vanguard party (FVP), is charged by the Cuban government with the
selection of young men to be trained in Cuba. Riboberto Carmona and Jose
Murillo, PVP members, left Costa Rica last June for training under this
program, and FVP leaders had plans for organizing guerrilla training programs
in Costa Rica under the direction of the Costa Ricans who had received training
in Cuba.
&. The Dominican Republic: The provisional Council of State,
which is preparing the country for its first free elections this December
in more than 30 years, has been a major target for Cuban subversion. A
cadre of Dominican Communists is headquartered in Cuba, and clandestine con-
tact is probably maintained with sympathizers inside the Dominican Republic.
Broadcasts to the Dominican Republic from Cuba have helped incits the
frequent riots in Santo Domingo. The fact that broadcasts from Cuba have on
occasion referred to very recent events in the Dominican Republic strongly
suggests the presence of clandestine radio contacts between the two countries.
h. Ecuador: The Communist party of Ecuador has formed the
nucleus of a small guerrilla organization. This group was drawn largely from
the pro-Castro Revolutionary Union of Ecuadoren Youth (URJE), which was
involved in a two-day battle with government forces last April. The leader
of the April affair, as well as several other Ecuadorenans involved in sub-
versive activities, has received guerrilla training in Cuba. A URJE leader
told a friend last June that this organization has so far in 1982 received
$22,000 in financial aid from the Cuban government.
Manuel Araujo Hidalgo, pro-Communist former Eaudoreen Minister
of Interior who has visited Cuba and who recently traveled in Communist
China, appears to be working with the URJE. He is reported to have received
a considerable amount of money from the Cuban government for his efforts,
according to a private statement by the URJE lesder.
i. El Salvador: On 1 March 1961, the Salvador government
broke relations with the Castro regime after it had received evidence of
conversation between the Cuban charge, Roberto Lassalle, and leading Salvadoran
Communists in which Lassalle urged increased revolutionary activity.
J. Guatemala: On 5 March 1962, a Cuban arrived in Mexico with a
message for a leader then in Mexico of the Guatemalan Communist-influenced
7
NW 50955 DocId:32423736 Page 65


13 November group, which had recently engaged in guerrilla activity in
Guatemala. The Cuban gave him $4,000 which he said was the first install-
ment of a total of $10,000 to be used to establish a new guerrilla front
in Guatemala. On 8 March, Castro's emissary gave the Guatemalans the balance
of the $10,000 and told one of the 13 November Leaders that the decision to
provide them with the money was taken by Fidel Castro personally. Castro,
he said, had sent instructions that the group did not have to account for how
the money was spent, that no strings were attached, and that he hopes they
are successful so he can provide them with additional assistance. Later the
Cuban emissary met with leaders in Mexico of the orthodox Guatemalen
Communist party. These Guatemalen Communists had apparently complained that
the Cuban money was not going to them. They were told that Castro wanted
the money to go to the 13 November group because this group had demonstrated
its capacity to fight the Guatemalan government, a capacity which the
Guatemalan Communists had not shown. The Cuban said: "It is not a matter
of standing around with Arab fatalism waiting for events to take place-
We should act efficiently so as to precipitate the death of imperialism.
Because of this we are ready to help anyone who may decide to struggle against
imperialism anywhere."
Cuban propaganda media have sought through publicizing the
activities of the 13 November group to increase its prestige and chances for
success. A Frensa Latinus reporter published an alleged interview with
13 November leader Yon Sosa.
k. Haiti: A cadre of Haitian Communists led by Rene Depestre is
resident in Cuba, and many thousands of Haitian citizens living in eastern
Cuba are now being subjected to Communist regimentation and indoctrination.
1. Honduras: Prior to the break in Cuban-Honduran diplomatic
relations in April 1961, Cuban personnel under the cover of consular and
diplomatic offices engaged in proselyting in the north coast region of
Honduras. Honduras now is the target of a particularly vicious regular radio
program becamed especially to Honduras by Radio Havana. Many Honduras are
in Cuba under the "scholarship" program.
m. Mexico: The Cuban embassy in Mexico City, the consulate in
Merida, and the "Cuban-Mexican Cultural Center" in Merida have all g
engaged in propaganda activities designed to encourage the pro-communist cause
in Mexico, particularly the Communist-influenced National Liberation Mova-
ment (MLN). Former Cuban ambassador in Mexico Portuondo is reported by people
in close contact with MLN leaders to have concluded an agreement whereby
some of the money sent by Havana to cover the expense of the embassy is ear-
marked as a contribution to the MLN. Mexican officials were disturbed at the
participation of Cuban embassy officials in inciting the anti-US demon-
strations by Mexican students in July and August 1960. Mexican authorities
have periodically impounded quantities of Cuban propaganda being sent through
Mexico to other Letin American countries. The most important aspect of
Mexico in Cuban propaganda and subversive operations in Latin America is its
use by the Cubana as a way station or jumping of place between Cuba itself
and the rest of Letin America.
8
NW 50955 DocId:32423736 Page 66


n. Nicaragua: A cadre of Nicaraguan Communists is based in
Cuba. Contact between them and pro-Castro Nicaraguans in Nicaragua and in
exile in other countries of the Caribbean area is maintained at least on a
sparcadic basis. A number of Nicaraguans periodically have traveled to Cuba
and some have received training there in guerrilla tactics. Reliable reports
indicate that some of these Cuba-trained Nicaraguans have been among the
small guerrilla bands that have infiltrated Nicaragua across the largely un-
guarded Hondruan border. The Nicaraguan government is the target of a
regularly broadcast Redio Revana program to Nicaragua which is announced as
the progran of "free Nicaraguana."
o. Panama: Cuban financial assistance is believed to be
channeled to the pro-Communist National Action Vanguard (VAN) in Panama. One
of the VAN leaders, Deputy Theima King, is a frequent traveler to Cuba and
claims to be a personal friend of Fidel Castro.
p. Paraguay: Feraguayen exides in Uruguay and Brazil have
received Cuban financial assistance. Four members of the United Front for
National Liberation (FULNA), a Communist Feraguayan exile group in Uruguay,
receive the equivalent of $230 monthly each from the Cuban embassy in
Uruguay to finance clandestine pro-Castro activities in Uruguay, according
to a Paraguayan exile in Uruguay who is in close touch with FULNA.
4. Fesru: At least eight Feruvians traveled to Cuba by way of
Mexico last June to receive training and indoctrination in that country.
Other Peruvian Communists or pro-Communists have long been in Cuba and a
regularly broadcast Radio Havana program is beamed to Peru.
r. Uruguay: The Cuban embassy in Montevideo has been engaged
in promoting pro-Castro propaganda. In January 1961 the Uruguayan govern-
ment was obliged to declare the Cuban ambassador persona non grata for
intervening in internal Uruguayan affairs.
8. Venezuela: The Castro regime has been extremely vitriolic
in its propaganda blasts against the Betancourt administration in Venezuela.
Cuban assistance has been channeled to members of the militant opposition
Leftist Revolutionary Movement (MIR), which is attempting to develop a
guerrilla movement in Venezuela with the aid of its ally, the regular Vena-
zuelan Communist party. While there is little evidence to indicate direct
Cuban involvement in this Communist effort, a significant number of the lead-
ing figures involved, including Fabricio Ojeda, are known to have traveled
to Cuba, where they probably received financial and other assistance in
addition to official encouragement and propaganda support for their activities.

Policies Toward Latin America
42.
Here Castro has more capability for independent
action than in any other field except the internal politics of Cuba.
Gastro is deeply committed to a policy of armed insurrection
throughout Latin America. Because of his own experience he has
a deep-seated belief that only through insurrection can revolution
be promoted in Latin America. Further, he apparently believes that
a successful revolution in another Latin American country would give
great impetus to the revolutionary movement and would also consoli-
date his own regime in Cuba. In trying to foment insurrections, he
apparently does not believe it crucial that he cannot now give direct
military assistance to them, nor does he seem to consider it impor-
tant whether he has or has not Soviet support. For the Soviets,
however, such an inflexible approach smacks of the Chinese position
and causes great problems in dealing with other Latin American
Communists. Most important, however, it is probable that the
Soviets believe such a posture will damage Soviet prospects for
penetration of Latin America and inevitably bring about a confronta-
tion with the US.

18. Cuban overseas military capabilities remain severely
limited by lack of the requisite air or sea lift. The Cubans could
probably not undertake an overseas operation on a sasale larger than
one battalion. For political as well as military reasons, the Castro
regime is most unlikely to undertake military operations of this nature.
It would prefer to concentrate on rendering clandestine support to
local insurgents.

31. The decline of his prestige has at least for the moment
reduced Castro's capability for subverting popular groups and
moving them into action against their own governments and
against US interests. Local fidelistas have encountered greater difficulty
in mobilizing mass support for anti-government strikes and demonstrations
on other than local issues.

32. Nonetheless, Castro continues his appeal for revolution in
Latin America on the Cuban model. Those Latin Americans who are
committed to violent revolution continue to look to Castro for help,
particularly from his training program in Cuba and his large-scale
dissemination of printed and broadcast propaganda. Communist
agitators are concentrating their efforts increasingly in rural areas,
as they have done in Peru recently. In addition, there has been an
increase in sabotage and other violence perpetrated by extremists,
of the sort not requiring the participation of large popular groups, yet
designed to provoke drastic countermeasures by governments and to
increase popular anti-government sentiment. These widespread
activities have demonstrated that the ability of local Communists to engage
in terrorist and subversive activities and their willingness to accept Cuban
and Soviet support do not depend upon Castro-s prestige or upon their
opinion of his doctrines and policies.

Che Gnevara's mother, who lives in Argentina, told a clandestine
source in mid.-December that during her recent visit to Cuba her son
told her that Cuban leaders now feel they will have to rely more and
more on their own efforts to promote Communist penetration in South
America. Guerrillas will be used on a large scale after they have
received training in Cuba, Gnevara said. He explained to his mother that
this is necessary since both he and Castro feel Harnushev "let them
down" and has no further interest in spreading Communism in South America.
Gnevara added that he and Castro believe they and the Chinese are
better Communists than Rhurahchev. (CIA DD/F Buenos Aires, 19 December,

CIA Report 21 Dec 62 Rome
Translation of report dated 6 Dec 62 from Italian Embassy Havana to
Foreign Ministry in Rome. "As I noted in my 9 November report is is
difficult for Castro to remain calm. Therefore the revolutionary regime
will continue with all means at its deposition to disseminate subversive
propaganda in the whole continent, as demonstrated by the fact that all the
states of Latin America (including Mexico) are taking strong measures
against the dissemination of this propaganda. But it is doubtful that

today Castro can do much more and that/constitutes a real menace to the
security of other countries, if only because he lacks the necessary funds.
I tend to share the opinion of the Ambassador to Brazil that the Cuban
leaders are trying to concentrate all their subversive efforts in one
country, and that they have selected Venezuela for various reasons, in-
cluding the old ill feeling between Castro and Betancourt. I note in
passing that, according to what was told me by the aforementioned
Ambassador, during the recent meeting of the OAS the Venezuelan representative
accused the Cubans of promoting the recent attempts in his country but, when
asked to furnish proof, he was unable to do so."

SEORE
: COREIGN DISSEAM
The recent apate of public addresses by leading Cuban officials
on the subject of insurrection in other Latin American countries reflects
a more aggressive stames than prior to the "missile crisis" and suggests
that a decision to step up Cuban support for subversive groups in other
Latin American countries may be under discussion within the inner circle
of Cuban leaders.
The Gsevara and Education Minister Armando Hart have been in the
foreign since late November in publicly expressing the view that the
only road to the "liberation" of the Latin American peoples is the road of
insurrection. Fidel Castro's earlier public line had been to deny the
necessity for Cube to "export" its revolution; Cuba's "example" was
sufficient. This line is given only perfunctory attention in the recent
Guevara and Hart speeches. The line emerging in these speeches appears
even stronger than that espoused in the "Second Declaration of Havane"
promulgated last February which suggested that in certain circumstances
Commit-dominated coalitions could come to power by peaceful means. The
whole tenor of the recent speeches suggests that Cuba, intends to provide
every assistance within its means to Latin American insurgents. The
attention given in the Cuban press to developments in Venezuela in recent
weeks strongly suggests a more than academic interest in developments there.
Canadian Ambassador Kidd, especulating on the "Trotsky-like dedication
to permanent revolution" apparent in a 21 November speech by Armando Hart,
commented that Cuban leaders may be attempting to counter "the hunil-
ation of the withdrawal of the Russian missiles" by making renewed efforts
to "light revolutionary fires in neighboring countries." (Comment on:

SECRET-NO FOREIGN DISSE M SUPPLEMENT THE CASTRO THREAT TO LATINAMERICA Despite diminished prestige, especially among government leaders, Castro retains great influence over politically unsophisticated Latin Americans. He is also supported by Western Hemisphere Communist parties and the vast majority of extreme leftists. Castro' s main appeal lies in his claim to be the leader of a successful revolution against" Yankee imperialism" and in the support he is ready to provide subversive activities throughout LatinAmerica.  The degree to which Cuba is involved in current hemisphere unrest is not clear. Antigovernment nationals and Communists of various Latin American countries, however,  have made frequent visits to Cuba to receive pro- Castro indoctrination and propaganda. During 1962,1,000 to 1,500 are believed to have received intensive education and training in sabotage and guerrilla warfare. Significant representation has been noted from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru Bolivia, Paraguay, and Nicaragua. There is no definite C proof that Cuba is now exporting arms to any dissident groups,  but propaganda materials, explosives, and financial support are reliably reported to have been furnished.  Cuban leaders have also called wi h increasing frequency for open rebellion as the" only road" to liberation for the Americas; they have been especially vociferous since the first of the year. Leading officials, such as Castro, BlasRo ca,  Che Guevara, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, and Juan Marinello are among those calling for revolutionary violence. The " Betancourt tyranny" in Venezuela has been designated a primary target, but Peru and Chile apparently also have high priority. The use of the Prensa Latina organization and the agent network already in existence makes it virtually sure that Havana will intensify its clandestine activities.  Latin American governments are generally now more alert to Castro' s threat. Inadequate security forces and widespread poverty throughout the area, however, make it almost certain that Cuban- supported insurgency- will have an effect out of proportion to the number of people involved.

(EXCEPT FROM UNCLASSIFIED DEPARTMENT OF STATE WHITE PAPER ON CUBA ISSUED
AUG 1960)
1. Armed Incursions.
No sooner had the Revolutionary Government of Cuba taken power
than it launched a program for exporting its revolution to other countries
in the Hemisphere, particularly in the Caribbean area. The memories of
the invasions and attempted invasions of Panama, of Nicaragua, and of
the Dominican Republic, following closely upon one another in the spring
and summer of 1959 are still fresh. Support of Cuban officials for
military expeditions against the Governments of these countries, although
vehemently denied, has been established beyond reasonable doubt. With
the invasion of the Dominican Republic came the realization among the
American Republics that international tensions in the Caribbean area,
to which Cuba had significantly contributed, had risen to the extent that
a Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American
States was necessary.
The Investigating Committee appointed by the Council of the OAS,
acting provisionally as Organ of Consultation under the Inter-American
Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, in the Panama case in June, 1959 con-
cluded "that the Republic of Panama was the victim of an invasion,
organized abroad, that sailed from a Cuban port and was composed almost
entirely of foreigners". The Committee report stated that the Chairman
of the Committee was able to confirm that 82 of 84 imprisoned invaders
NW 50955 DocId:32423736 Page 79


were Cubans. Further, the Government of Panama, prior to the departure
of the invasion group from Cuba informed the Cuban Government of reports
about this impending event, invoking the 1928 Habana Convention on the
Duties and Rights of States in the Event of Civil Strife. The Cuban
Foreign Minister in turn assured Panama that the Cuban Government would
take the necessary preventive measures.
In connection with several of the invasions or attempted invasions
of Nicaragua from Costa Rica and Honduras in June, 1959, and the
individuals organizing them, documentary and other types of evidence
which came to light demonstrated Cuban officials support in the form of
arms and financial contributions.
Official Cuban complicity in the invasion of the Dominican Republic
in the same month was clear. The expedition was organized, trained, and
equipped in Cuba with the undoubted assistance of Cuban officials. An
officer on active duty with the Cuban Rebel Army was one of the expedi-
tion's leaders. The Cuban Navy escorted the three landing craft used
by the invading force on their voyage to the Dominican Republic.
Even during the Fifth Meeting of Consultation in Santiago, Chile,
8 report was received of the invasion of Haiti on August 13, 1959 by a
group of armed men coming from Cuba. The Heitien Government after the
Santiago meeting expressed its fears of further invasion attempts. It
charged that the August 13 invasion from Cuba was a violation of the
1928 Habana Convention on Duties and Rights of States in the Event of
Civil Strife. The assistance of Cuban officials, including the Cuban

Ambassador to Haiti and his five military attaches, in the attempt to
overthrow the Haitian Government was denounced by that Government. The
Cuban Government, though admitting that the invasion was launched in
Cube and all but one of the participants were Cubans, conveniently dis-
avowed the acts of the Cuban citizens involved.

33. There have been indications of disapproval of Castro-s
policies on the part of those Latin American Communist parties
which are committed to a more gradual and less violent approach to
revolution. Castro has shown himself willing to collaborate with any
group, Communist or not, willing to resort to violence and in so doing
to circumvent some of the regular Communist parties. Some of the
latter resent such tactics and have appealed to the Soviets against
Castro. It seems likely that the question of relations with other
Listin Amendment Communist parties, as well as the question of tactics,
is likely to hamper Communist revolutionary efforts in Latin America
and cause strains in Soviet-Cuban relations.

Among much of the revolutionary left, discussion has
tended to shift to the need for indigenous, nationalist revolutions, and
away from internationalism and alliance with Moscow-oriented
Communists and fidelistas.

Panamanian Communist Party (FDP) leeder Ruperto Thomas* recent
trip to Cuba was evidently an effort to persuade Castro to support the
PDP rather than the more activist Panamanian pro-Communist VAN group.
When he returned to Panama on 14 December, Thomas reportedly said that
Jorge Turner, who also went to Havana in September and has not returned,
and other VAN leaders are still campaigning against the FDP in Cuba.
However, the Cubans claim to have told VAN leaders they must cooperate
with the FDP to get Castro support.
The Castro government seems consistently to favor the VAN with
funds and international trips. The Cubens may distrust the FDP's poor
organization and believe VAN charges that the FDP is infiltrated. However,
the VAN is a rather unstable group and the Cubens are probably trying to
keep on good terms with both. Thomas said he received no military training
but was taught a few things like how to diamantle a machine gun.
Thomas commented that no particular group seemed to be in command
in Cuba, resulting in such disorder that it was a wonder the revolution
had survived. He believes the ORI is merely a mechanism.
Mexico would not issue Thomas a visa, so he returned to Panama via
Prague where he talked with Czech Communist officials and may have
pleaded the FDP case against VAN with them. (CIA Panama City TDCS-3/

Cuban Anniversary Celebrations
(See pictures following)
The Cuban Armed Forces parade in Havana yesterday
included infantry, naval, artillery, armor, and air
formations. The most significant display was that
of SA-2 missiles and possible cruise missiles.
Ground units included 15 companies of the 2d Western
Army, units of the National Militia, and other
infantry units in a "new parade step" resembling the
goose step. The artillery unit had antitank guns, heavy
artillery, multiple rocket launchers and AA. artillery.
Three battalions of medium tanks, heavy tanks and
assault guns, along with the surface-to-air and possible
cruise missiles made up the final unit of the parade.
The air formations included helicopters, propeller-
type training planes, and MIG-15's, 19's and 21's.
Soviet participation in the parade has not been established,
al:hough Soviets and Czechs may have piloted some of
the aircraft.
Premier Castro's speech following the parade brought
no surprises aside from its unusual brevity. He
made an effort to indicate Cuban control of the air
defense system, including the SA-2's, and, in a
probable reference to US reconnaissance flights, said
there could be an incident "at any time".
and here
Castro reiterated the five demands he first made
after the announcement that the Soviets would
withdraw offensive missiles from Cuba. He
included his usual anti-US statements and slurs at
President Kennedy and made a low-keved appeal for
"unity" within the Communist Bloc. He called for
revolution in Latin America, with special emphasis
on Venezuela, and cited Cuba's "historic task
of-serving as an example" for that revolution.
In the USSR, Cuban and Soviet spokesmen lauded Cuban-
Russian friendship and unity, and the Soviet
spokesman, Suslov, pledged that his country would
"never leave Revolutionary Cuba alone in distress."

C
reportedly continues, the threat of retaliatory action from forces
rallying around deposed Air Force Chief Lemus has apparently
diminished, and the majority of the armed forces still supports
President Ydigoras. The President's intention with regard to
leftist ex-President Arevalo, who plans to return and seek the
presidency in next December's elections, is an unsettling factor.
The armed forces universally oppose Arevalo. Some factions want
to replace Ydigoras with a civilian-military junta and call new
elections before Arevalo becomes eligible to run in March. Should
Arevalo return, the military will probably move to prevent his
candidacy and the coming months may be critical.
Honduran President Villeda Morales, although not a strong
leader, is expected to complete his term. The ruling Liberal
Party will probably retain the Presidency in the October elections,
and maneuvering for the nomination has begun. Rodas Alvarado,
President of the Congress and one of the three leading contenders,
has used his position to build up strength, but the armed forces
regard him as the least desirable and a developing anti-Rodas
coalition may prevent his nomination. Either of the three leading
candidates would probably follow the present government's policies,
including its relatively soft Communist stand. The Communists,
while not yet a direct threat, are steadily increasing their
influence in the labor field and are exploiting the country's
discouraging political, economic, and social conditions.
El Salvador, faced with a serious Communist threat about
two years ago, continues to show political and economic progress,
but there are clouds on the horizon. President Rivera, who
assumed control last summer in a full return to constitutional
government, still has widespread support and military backing.
The government is moving ahead with its reform program, but
there is some resistance to the proposed new income taxes.
Communist activities have been curbed, but the Communists still
retain a subversive capability particularly among labor and
student groups. There is concern over the likely election of a
pro-Communist as rector of the university, a center of sub-
version and intrigue.
Costa Rica continues to be one of the most democratic and
politically stable countries in Latin America but there are
reverberations of unrest stemming from the deteriorating economic
situation. The ruling National Liberation Party, which was
returned to power in last year's election in a bitterly contested
but peaceful election, represents the liberal left, although it
includes a number of moderates such as President Orlich and some
members of his cabinet. The Communist Party is small and illegal

SECRET-NO FOREIGN D IS SEM Panama is relatively quiet. Although Panama has failed to receive any commitment for along- sought renegotiation of the Canal Zone treaty, continuing talks on areas of disagreement and some concessions have eased tensions and softened violent anti- US propaganda. Public emotion may again be aroused, however, by the recent petition, filed by a Communist lawyer, requesting the Supreme Court to declare the treaty unconstitutional. President Chi ari has also indicated he expects to press for increased compensation during the forthcoming talks. On the internal scene, President Chi ari has failed to provide a strong administration. Corruption continues; the cabinet is divided by conflicting loyalties and ambitions; badly needed reforms have not yet been adopted; and the chronically depressed economy remains stagnant.  The stability which has marked the 30- year dominance of Mexico' s Party of Revolutionary Institutions( PRI) is gradually being recorded. Extreme right and left factions of the PRI are vying for domination. In attempting to placate both, President Lopez Matos has adopted inconsistent and vacillating policies,  pleasing neither group. Forces outside the PRI also pose an increasing threat- - particularly the recently formed Independent Peasant Central( CCI) with which leftist ex- President Cardenas is associated. The CCI, organized to exploit unrest among the land-  less peasant, may- also attempt to challenge the PRI politically.  To undercut the CCI, the government plans to complete the land distribution program by the end of Lopez Mateos' term late next year. Although this may alleviate discontent in the agrarian sector. Rising population and mounting unemployment will continue to be major problems.

Construction of the fishing port in the Bay of Havana, whose
announcement as a Soviet undertaking caused so much concern last fall,
will be directed by a team of Soviet technicians and Cuban engineers
and will start in February - according to a Havana radio announcement.
The port is to be completed by the end of 1963 and is to cost 12 million
pesce, which will be met by a lean from the Soviet Union, to be amortized
over 10 years. The port is expected to serve 130 vessels of the Soviet
fishing fleet and from 24 to 30 of the Cuban fleet. It will have
installations such as freener plants for 10,000 tons of fish, factories
for processing sea products, machinery for making no less than 80 tons
of ice a day, a fleeting dock to repair ships of up to 2,500 tons, and
vell-equipped repair shops. The announcement emphasized that the port is
to be operated by and will be the "absolute property of the Cuban state."
It has also been announced that Poland has now formulated plans for
building the shipyard envisaged in the port of Mariel. The installation
will be managed by Cuban technicians who are presently receiving training
in Polish shipyards on the Baltic. Ship construction will reportedly
reach a level of 70,000 tons per year. (FEIS 58, 17 January, and Daily

SUPPLEMENT
THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA, PANAMA, AND MEXICO
Central America is relatively stable. Preparations are
under way for President Kennedy's scheduled meeting with the Chiefs
of State of these countries at San Jose, Costa Rica, on 18 and 19
March. Tensions are rising, however, in those countries having
elections scheduled this year; Mexico's political stability is
threatened; and the Cuban subversive potential remains a problem
throughout the area.
During the forthcoming meeting, an attempt will be made to
center discussions on areas of common interest. Economic integrat-
tion of the Central American region -- one of the major objectives
of the Alliance for Progress Program -- will undoubtedly be em-
phasized. Central America, which has been moving toward greater
political unity, has begun to take steps toward economic integra-
tion, and presently envisages the creation of a Common Market by
1965. The Cuban subversive threat is also likely to be given top
priority. All of the Central American countries regard this as
one of the major problems and are seeking ways to meet it.
On 3 February, Nicaraguans are scheduled to cast ballots for
the first time in nearly 30 years for a Presidential candidate
who is not a member of the Somoza family. Rene Schick -- the
government's Liberal Party (PLN) candidate and hand-picked by the
Somozas -- is expected to win easily, however. Effective oppo-
sition to Schick collapsed when the major opposition party --
Trajitionalist Conservative (PCT) -- boycotted the elections
because the government refused to permit OAS supervision. The
only opponent is Diego Manuel Chamorro Bolanos, a last-minute
candidate of the splinter Nicaraguan Conservative Party (PCN),
whose entry into the race seems to have been engineered by the
government to provide a semblance of opposition. Castro-
Communistelements, militant conservatives and others may attempt
to create disorders before or during the elections, but the
Nicaraguan National Guard is believed capable of controlling
any troubles short of a general uprising or well -coordinated
rebel invasion -- neither of which seems likely.
Anti-Somoza Nicaraguans have alleged fraudulent registra-
tions and may attempt to challenge the elections. Although
Schick may not turn out to be a Somoza puppet, opposition
suspicions will be reinforced with the likely retention of

Campesino Strike Scheduled in Bolivia
A planned Campesino (peasant) strike in Bolivia today
could lead to violence if it occurs. The Government
reportedly plans to block all entrances into La Paz,
and campesinos loyal to the government are assembling
and arming to counter the strikers who are led by
pro-Communist Torrbio Salas. A government spokesman
claims that the Cuban and Czechoslovak Embassies are
financing the strike and that the Cubans are training
campesino militia in other areas as well.
President Paz has reportedly said he will do every-
thing to prevent the strike but will call on loyal
campesinos for aid if he fails. If armed conflict
develops between the two groups of campesinos,
the Armed Forces would probably be forced to step in.
President Paz might also have to take action against
trouble makers like Salas, something he has tried to
would

Three top Brazilian Communist Party officials, including Luis
Cursa Prestes, are reported leaving for Cube via Prague prior to
15 January to discuss certain political problems with the Cuban
Communists responsible for pro-Cuban activities in the different Latin
American countries. Before leaving they planned to be briefed by a
Brazilian Communist Party member who has just returned from a visit to
party leaders in Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Bolivia to get their
opinions about holding the "Latin American Congress in Support of Cuba,"
now rescheduled for March, in Rio or Sao Paulo. (CIA, Rio de Janeiro,

NO FOREIGN DISSEMI
The National Executive Commission of Brazil's orthodox Communist
Party (FCB) reportedly planned to meet on 7 January to discuss the
party position in relation to Francisco Jullico, Brazilian Peasent-League
leader who has been closer to Brazil's dissident hard-line Communist
Party than to its orthodox group (CFB). The PCB leaders planned to
consider the possibility of sending a high-level party delegation to
Cuba to confer with Fidel Castro, not only to improve relations but
to protest a report that Castro! is supporting Julico. (CIA Sao Paulo,
TDCS-3533404, 9 January, SECRET)
Comment: Cuba has for some time had a divisive influence on
Brazilian Commitiet affairs. The dissident Communist Party formed in
late 1961 has - like Julico - favored a more revolutionary line and has
apparently received considerably more support from Cuba than has the
orthodox party. Another indication of the divisive influence of Cuba
is the report that Francisco Lives Otero, PCB leader responsible for
matters pertaining to Cuba, attacied party abuserience to the GFSU at
a national PCB conference on 29 November. Leaves maintained that the
PCB should discuss the Sino-Soviet dispute with complete independence,
rather than maintain silence on it as it had been doinga (SECRET)

TO DISCUSS WITH LOPEZ MATEOS.
2. LOMBARDO GAVE ROMERO THE FOLLOWING REASONS FOR HIS TRIP TO
BRAZIL. HE SAID THAT A GROUP OF BRAZILIAN PERSONALITIES AND
INTELLECTUALS HAD CONVOKED A CONGRESS WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO BE HELD
IN RIO DE JANEIRO IN MARCH 1963. HE SAID THE TWO PRINCIPAL AIMS
OF THE CONGRESS ARE:
A. TO CREATE AN ORGANIZATION IN DEFENSE OF CUBA.
B. TO EXAMINE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS EXISTING IN LATIN
AMERICAN COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO PROMOTE THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT OF LATIN AMERICA.
3. LOMBARDO SAID THAT SOMETHING WENT WRONG IN BRAZIL BECAUSE,
APART FROM THE COMMITTEE WHICH CONVOKED THE CONGRESS, A SECOND
SEPARATE COMMITTEE HAD SPRUNG UP WHOSE AIMS ARE THE SAME, AND
THAT A SORT OF RIVALRY HAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS.
LOMBARDO SAID THE RESULT WAS "THAT MY COMRADES IN EUROPE HAVE
ASKED ME TO GO TO BRAZIL TO INTERVENE IN THE MATTER, TO TRY TO ORGANIZE
A SINGLE UNITED COMMITTEE, AND MAKE DEFINITE PREPARATIONS FOR THE
HOLDING OF THE CONGRESS IN ORDER TO ENSURE ITS SUCCESS." LOMBARDO
SAID THE COMRADES IN EUROPE" SHOULD HAVE SENT AN ARGENTINE, A CHILEAN;
A URUGUAYAN, OR SOMEONE NEARER BRAZIL, BUT THEY INSISTED ON SENDING
HIM BECAUSE HE HAS EXPERIENCE, AND THEY ARE CONVINCED THAT HE CAN
STRAIGHTEN THINGS OUT SATISFACTORILY.

The company executives attributed the pro-communist
sentiment as revealed, mainly to the economic difficulties ex-
perienced by low-income families as a result of the rampant.
inflation. They said their labor relations were good, that while
their pay scales were not as high as those in some other industries,
some popular fringe benefits were provided, and that to the best of
their knowledge there had been no communist agitators at work
among their employees.
Not long before this visit I was lunching one day at the
Jockey Club with Sr. Paulo Ayres Filho, a Brazilian banker and
pharmaceutical manufacturer who is the spark-plug of IPES
(Instituto de Pesquisas Economicas e Sociais), the principal demo-
cratic action group in the local business world. Looking around him
at the other tables, occupied by a good many well-known figures of
São Paulo's conservative upper classes, Sr. Ayres said to me,
"Apart from the two of us, there isn't a man in this dining room who
is seriously concerned over the communist danger in Brazil. "
No conclusions, obviously, should be drawn from such
slender indications. It has been my observation, however, that
most Brazilians either believe that a communist take-over would
be impossible in Brazil, or believe that even if it occurred, it
would take a relatively mild form with which they could live. The
Brazilian's boasted calm, which is genuine and in most circumstances
a virtue, could in the present state of affairs be the cause of his undoing.

1.
Maximo Gruber, a major in the Cuban Army and one of the
leaders of the G-2 section, has been appointed technical leader
of the Communist guerrillas in Sumapaz, Colombia. 1 Gruber,
a Polish Jew, was formerly a commissar in Spain. His wife
is European. His son Maximo is a graduate of the Lenin
Institute in Moscow. On his frequent trips to Bolivia,
Uruguay, and Cuba he carries a Bolivian diplomatic pass-
port identifying him as "traveling inspector of the
Bolivian Foreign Ministry."
2.
Gruber is being assisted in his tasks in Colombia by
Jaime Guerra, also known as Captain Veneno. One of his
liaison officers to the Communist Party of Colombia is
Blanca Diaz y Collazo, a lawyer and former member of the
Cuban Embassy in Bogota, who was trained in Prague in 1952.
1. Headquarters Comment. An official British service
reported in April 1961 that Maximo Grobart, nationality
unknown, was training guerrillas in the Sumapaz area;
Grobart, who claimed to be of Hungarian origin, had a
Cuban passport in the name of Jose Blanco and might
have had other passports of different nationalities.

Alfredo Vera Arrata, a member of the National Executive Council
of the Revolutionary Union of Ecuadoran Youth (URJE) until his
expulsion from URJE during its National Convention held in early
January 1963, has received a letter from Pedro Martinez Pirez,
First Secretary of the Cuban Embassy in Santiago, Chile, in
which he asks Vera to send a person to Chile to inform him on
current leftist activity in Ecuador. Vera plans to send
Jaime Galarza Zavala, also expelled from URJE, if funds can be
raised for the trip.
Field Comment. Martinez is in charge of Cuban subversive
activities in Chile, Peru, and Ecuador.

SECRET- NO FOREIGN DISSE M Peruvian Communist Elements Coordinating Their Activities Orthodox Communists in Peru are apparently putting aside their differences and moving toward closer co- operation with the extremist Trotskyist faction,  believed to be leading the recent outbreak of disorders. The groups are reportedly co- ordinating previously random plans to carryout extensive destruction of industrial and agricultural installations and to provoke uprisings. Cubans and other Latin American nationals as well as Havana and Moscow- trained Peruvians are said to be instrumental in this latest development.  Members of the Peruvian junta have expressed serious concern over the internal situation and hinted that they favor strong action. Although constitutional guarantees have been suspended in a fourth department, and several Army units have been moved into the areas of disorders, the junta has taken no further action. It has requested riot control equipment from the US and says it is ready to embark on an anti- Communist program upon assurance that the equipment is forthcoming.

Peruvian Junta Makes Firm Anti-Communist Move
Continued Communist-incited disorders and an alleged
Havana-Moscow plan to take over the government
prompted the military junta to suspend constitutional
guarantees in Pe'ru and institute a nationwide state
of siege early on 5 January. Military commanders
assumed political control in their respective zones,
and a reported 800 Communist Party leaders and pro-
Communist subversives have been arrested. The
Lima headquarters of several Communist and
Communist-front organizations, as well as their
publications, have been closed.
According to the Communist plan, subversive activity
was to have been intensified between 15 and 20
January in all parts of Peru, with assaults on
banking and commercial institutions, military
garrisons, vital communications facilities, and
universities. A clandestine radio station operating
on the Bolivian border allegedly was to direct
and co-ordinate this activity.
The junta has regarded members of the leftist but
non-Communist American Popular Revolutionary
Alliance (APRA) a greater danger than the
Communists and originally tended to blame them
for the disorders. There is no proof that APRA
has been involved in anything but legitimate
strike activity. Suspension of constitutional
guarantees would enable the junta to strike at
APRA to discredit and weaken it before the scheduled
elections next June. (SECRET)

SUPPLEMENT
THE VENEZUELAN SITUATION
A number of high-ranking Cuban leaders since the first of
the year have publicly called for revolution, in other Latin
American countries, with Venezuela singled out as a country
with top priority.
Coinciding with these appeals have been reports that the
Venezuelan Communist Party (PCV) planned to step up terrorist
activity to discredit President Betancourt before his US
visit. The recent incidence of terrorism, which has included
attacks on the US Chamber of Commerce office building and the
burning of Sears, Roebuck warehouses, is apparently part
of this campaign.
Involved in the current terrorism is the Armed Forces of
National Liberation (FALN). The FALN, although purporting to
represent all of the opposition, includes some prominent
Communists and is emerging as a paramilitary force of the PCV
with its main strength in the Caracas area.
Guerrilla bands also operate in western Venezuela, but
there is no firm evidence that their activity is coordinated
with that in the Caracas area. Venezuelan army units, with
air support, have been used in a recent campaign against
these guerrillas.
The armed forces are generally capable of maintaining
internal security and of defending the nation's borders
against neighboring countries. The vast majority supports
constitutionality and is loyal to the Betancourt government.
The armed forces would not hesitate, however, to take over the
government in order to maintain order or to forestall a
Communist uprising. The armed forces were earlier greatly
frustrated over the government's inaction against Communist-
instigated disorders. Betancourt's recent willingness to
take more vigorous action, however, coupled with the strong
support given the US during the Cuban crisis, has overcome
much of this dissatisfaction, and armed forces' support of
the government is greater now than it was six months ago.
The officer corps is generally free of Communist
penetration, although there has been some infiltration in the
Marine corps, two or three battalions having been involved
in leftist-led revolts during the spring of 1962.

Extremist And Police Activities In Venezuela
Venezuela has been afflicted over the past several
months with a rash of Castro-Communist terrorist actions.
Many incidents, involving shootings and robberies, are
connected with the Movement of the Revolutionary Left,
the Venezuelan Communist Party, and the Armed Forces
of National Liberation -- the Castro-Communist group
credited with the destruction at the Maracaibo oil
fields during the Cuban crisis. These activities are
probably designed to discredit and weaken the Betan-
court Government.
The police have demonstrated considerable proficiency
in preventing major outbreaks and in acting rapidly
to arrest terrorists. They have rounded up extremists
responsible for the holdup and looting of a printing
supply warehouse and the burning of the Dupont paint
warehouse and have captured the Communist leader of
guerrilla bands operating in the Falcon area of
northwestern Venezuela. (CONFIDENTIAL)

Venezuelan Communists Plan to Increase Violence
As part of its terrorist campaign, the Venezuelan
Communist Party reportedly plans to mark the fourth
anniversary of Betancourt's presidency on 13 February
by guerrilla bombings in the Caracas area. Other
Communists are to see to it that the capital is
flooded with propaganda that day. According to un-
confirmed reports, Venezuelan authorities have
charged the Castro government with ordering the recent
terrorism in both Venezuela and Colombia under an
extensive plan to create collective panic and insecurity
in both countries. Colombian military authorities
have reportedly drawn up a plan to prevent terrorism
in Colombia's cities.

TOP SECURE - SENSITIVE
Leites/Mandelstam/DRAFT/14 Mar 63/frc
SUBJECT: Alternative US Public Posture on Subversion in Letin America
1. Although our public posture on subversion in Letin America may
be too firmly established for instant end radical revision, the following
enalysis is offered on the assumption that some change in emphasis is
both possible and desirable, now or at some time in the future.
2. Given the existence of a Communist state, of either major per-
suasion, what is the likelihood that it will engage in subversion toward
neighboring states?
a. Total. All experience of the past forty years demonstrates
that a Communist state emanates subversion as the sun emanates heat.
b. But let us be clear that two kinds of subversion are involved:
(1) Hardware-centered - that is, funds, guns, tools of
sabotage.
(2) Egalitarian and libertarian ideals.
3. How much does this fact of inevitable subversion raise the prob-
ability of Communism spreading to target countries?
a. Subversion is never a sufficient condition - and frequently
not a necessary one.
b. If subversion is really dangerous to a target state, there
is per se something seriously wrong in that state. (France's "Nasser
Fallacy" of 1956; France embarked on the Suez adventure on the assumption
that if Nasser were disposed of, the trouble in Algeria would magically
disseppes". Although the game was not played cut, few would dispute the
conclusion that France's assumption was wrong; or, for that matter,
- SENSITIVE

SPOHIT - SENSITIVE
that France would have been in an even deeper morass if her military
forces had managed with the British to occupy Cairo.)
4.
How feasible is it to control subversion at the source without
destroying the Communist State?
Usually it is infeasible to do so or the costs are prohibitive.
For instance, the costs of a protracted tight quarantine which
could prevent the export both of hardware-oriented and idea subversion,
would be very high, even if the activity were accepted by Cuba and the
Soviet Union. This would mean inspecting every vessel, searching every
traveler, forcing planes down for inspection, etc. We submit (a) that
ideas would still be exported and (b) that by so doing we would magnify
the importance of Cuba beyond imagination. It would become a kind of
forbidden fruit. The analogy with prohibition in this country comes to
mind. This course involves an increment of prestige and lure to Cuba
which would be likely to outweigh the doubtless desirable diminution in
the export of trained subversives and associated hardware. Furthermore,
given the success of such an effort, the obvious Soviet counter would be
to use other channels which we could not surveil without major East-
West confrontation. The Cuban subversion export organization might well
move to Moscow, Prague and/or even Peiping. Therefore, to take a public
stance opposed to Cuban subversion without having resolved on invasion
is to be committed to a policy bound to demonstrate US impotence.
5. If we want to control subversion at the source by destroying
the Communist State, Cuba, how useful is it for us publicly to emphasize
hardware-centered subversion as the reason?

POF SECRET - SENSITIVE
a. For many people outside of the US, even the export of
subversion by force and sabotage also involves ideas and dedication,
as well as funds, arms, and other equipment. (We, for example, are
not ashamed of the Bay of Pigs expedition except that it failed.)
b. Usually attitudes toward violent subversion depend on
attitudes toward the target. (Example: acts against Jiminez, Trujillo
did not offend US/ most of Latin America/ most of the world; the paral-
lel today: Sonora, Yidgoras, Stroesser). We run the danger of falling
into the USSR projection of the US as the "world gendarme. " Subversion
directed against the Dutch government would outrage not only all America's
but also all non-Communist Europeans; its legitimacy is total. But the
same can not be said for most LA governments. The difference is decisive
and perhaps sometimes neglected.
c. Most people generally recognize that when violent subversion
is powerful, it is because it taps fundamental sources of discontent.
d. We in the US tend to look at subversion in Latin America
from the point-of-view of hardware. But a great deal of the subversion
in Latin America is or at least appears as idea-centered, not hardware-
centered. The export of "armed aggression" by dedicated revolutionaries
is only a part of the process. Another part, which is at least as impor-
tant, and probably more so, is the export of propaganda. This, however,
to much of the world, including Latin-America outside of the oligerchies,
will appear as an export of ideas and ideals (perhaps wrong, but never-
theless ideas). Our approach, then, tends to pass rather than meet the

Iatino viewpoints. We are very close to yutting ourselves into the
position of the Tsarist gendarmes who tried to use brute force against
the power of ideas. The trep is that we may seem thereby to be acimow-
ledging the decline and tanninent fall of our own ideas.
e. One consequence of this line of reasoning would be that,
if we ever find it necessary to invade Cubs, we should do so "to stop
the firing squads, " to guarantee free elections, " -- but not to save
Bomosa.
6. How feasible is it for us to control both kinds of subversion
at the target rather than at the source?
a. It is often feasible. This is how we have in fact success-
fully controlled subversion except in the dubious case of S. Vietnam.
Even in the difficult case of Greece, we succeeded by a combination of
military and economic measures.
b. The point is not that this is always a feasible way of hand-
ling the problem; rather it is often practicable and also often the most
desirable way.
7. Suppose that we decided to invade Cubs. to control subversion
with the result (three cases):
a. That we restored the status quo ante Castro:
b. That for reasons of expediency we try to maintain Castro's
"reforas" -- i.e., what many Latinos would regard as "socialism."
c. That we gave the Cuban people an obvious free choice, no
matter what ensued.
How would the prospects for Communism in the Western Hemisphere
be affected?

Case A: Boomerang - we would almost certainly enhance the
prospects for Communism.
Case B: There would be strong popular Latin American support,
some governmental outrage, but the prospects for Communism would be
diminished.
Case C: Paradoxically, the result would depend on what ensued,
because most Latin Americans do not trust the US (and particularly would
be skeptical of "free elections" if US soldiers were present).
CONCLUSIONS
1. Conditions in most parts of Latin America are such that sub-
version (Cuban or Bloc or both) is really dangerous.
2. Since this is so, the US public posture should not recognize
this; and we should abstain from public pronouncements that subversion
is conceivably a casus belli.
3. The point-of-view set forth in this paper, insofar as it can
be made operative, may tend to bring a fundamental alignment between the
US public posture and LA opinion.
4. The US course of action towards any LA country has to weigh the
advantages and disadvantages, in any given case at any given time, of
subversion control (s) at source or (b) at point of Impact.
5. The same principles would apply if another Communist-oriented
government were to come to power in any part of Latin America.
