Handling of a Soviet Defecter

1. I suggest that the story of ARLALDE, from the amount be walked into the
homo of Martin A. KOODING until he was merely under aliskas study in the United
States, deserves compiling, analysie, and publications in the form of an opera-
tional Aid. It riently illustrates the many problems which aust and can be sur-
mounted, and could be highly instructive to Chiera of Station in all countries
where the anti Soviet defector might appear.
2. Here is the Frankfurt contribution (written at any request) to such a
compilation: a cliffhanger from start to fiasen, but also a commentary on the
mog types of problems which can arise, and the fact that it takes hard work and
willful overviewation to solve them, it was a cliffhanger both before and after
the frequent character (I) aminate KODING for a model for his part) and ought to
make it more than the most important.
3. The handling of defeaters obviously is not a new responsibility to the
German Station. The (CISCHORS facility which aute primarily for the reseit,
establishment of bona fides, disorfieing, and resettlement of dectora has existed
here for the last decade. Nor in the movement by baso. revocation of operational
moral and a unique task for us c: perform. We have accomplished this many things
by
the National Association of the facility and also by the furnishing of alia
documentation to the person of intent and accomplining the transport via
scheduled NATF lights. The significant points which made the ARLALDE case unique
may never again in their entirety be publicated but in part they may well be,
and therefore should be enumerated:
a. A Soviet diplomat, and member of the KIS, stationed in a non-
Satellite but politically sensitive country, which at the time c: ARLALDE's
defection has decreased considerable Soviet pressure.
The reason for the National Association of the remaining hit of
defection were such that an incomplete decision by the man on the same land
to be made to take advantage of the opportunity.
c. The fact that little alternative could be given, under the facts
as described in (a) above, except to believe the defector's statements
and acquiesce in his demands, i.e., he possessed information of a significant
and perishable nature and would disclose it completely only upon arrival in
the United States.
d. The fact that came the commitments in (o) above were wide every
resemble effort had to be made to accommodate the defector's demand.
e. In order to accomplish all this an untried method of evacuation, i.e.,
black avocation via commercial airportiag that be to be accomplished in order to
be the proposed with the undertaking.
4. A retrospective study is as to how this case commenced, and the unique
factors connected with it as unsaturated above, land so to suggest for lack of
study what I refer to as "industrial" and "industrial" and "industrial"
"findings" in effect represent facts which, if not present, quite promably could
have deprived us in the of participating successfully in the covenent of the
ARLALDE family. The "areas of study," on the other hand, represent either answer-
able questions or matters in areas wherein operational disquasions may well take
place to see if some type of school-book solution can be devised.
5. I will elaborate below, where appropriate, on some of these "findings" but
will first record them

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Record
SUBJECT:
Handling at German Station 16 and 17 December of
Soviet Defector from Russian Embassy at Helsinki
1. This memorandum is designed to record, soon after the event,
all facts pertaining to the handling within the German Station of the
evacuation of a Soviet Vice Counsel (and member of the HIS) from the
Russian Embassy at Helsinki. The time of this writing there is
still lacking certain information about the current entire story. How-
ever, it is felt worthwhile to record all events which are not
still fresh. In the following paragraphs the defector is referred to
as "subje-t" and pseudonyms and identities are used in all other cases.
2. At approximately 0730 hours Saturday, 16 December, Arnold J.
EXACK (Chief (CABEZONE) contacted me at my home and asked me to proceed
in the relatively to the residence of Joel D. HENTHAM (Chief of Station).
Upon the meeting of the 1962 conference and LACK briefed me, on
14
the Stobcholm (able which announced 5/16/00) from intent to endeavor to
fly subject and family "black" from Stobcholm (to prevent the
air Attache aircraft. Cable also requested Frankfurt to have an air-
craft available to receive immediately subject and family and take off
forthwith to the United States. LACK also mentioned an IN cable from
BUT which requested Stobcholm) to move family consentest to (CHURZONE in
Franklin) to the United States.
3. By then adjourned to the office and awaited more word from
either (Stobcholm) which would advise on the arrival of the family
at Frankfurt, or from Headquarters concurring in the event
for immediate departures of the family for the United States upon
arrival at Frankfurt. EAOB was immediately alerted and they made
the same time to be made with augmented crew prepared to depart for
the United States by 12000. The Department for the subject's
family was put in the C-54 and the regulated call number was
removed and a false number put on the aircraft. The word V. LAPOLA
(Aeting Chief, COS/KUSCDA) was contacted and asked to come to the office
immediately. Discussions were then held with LAXCK and Carl T. UPOLL
as to the availability of a KIDOWK case officer with Russian language

4. Having heard nothing from either [Strobbolz]r Headquarters
by 0245 hours OPIM traffic was sent in both directions telling them
Germany was prepared to receive and effect immediate lack evacuation
of the family to the United States. In the meantime, it was
determined that IDENTITY A would be used as the security escort and
HOTEL K. MICHANK (AD/PI Staff) would be on standby to serve as a
HOTEL escort. This was a contingency arrangement because we looked
13
thetshother or not a KUDOVE officer from either Helsinki or
14
HOTELKINGA prepared to travel with subject all the way to Washing-
ten.
5. Around 1100 hours I asked Edward P. TOCHESMITY (Chief; EABO)
to establish contact with the Wiesbaden Air Paper-ter and lay on
the segments to monitor the flight of the [Strobbolz] Air Attache plane.
This was a business we have had previous instances of "black"
arrivals at Wiesbaden Airport. The staff actually arrived before the
EPA cable from (the Station) dispatching and the board to built 1115 hours
TOCHESKY informed me by telephone that the [Strobbolz] Air
ATTACHING C-45, was and had been at the Wiesbaden Air Base since
12 December 1999 about 1130 we abclied this information to/Stocblom/1/4-3
and DIN and also received dispatch an aircraft to Copenhagen to make
the pickup if Strobbolz) of the 1100 hours the body there. Because of
technical difficulties involving air, tolerances and lengths of runways,
we could not immeately get in the air. The Copenhagen.
6. At approximately 1145 hours a cable was removed from Head-
quarters concurring in the immediate evacuation from wheel-babden by EABO
aircraft of subject's family upon arrival. If such coule
arranged we were then requested to hold gublet and family at (CARZONNE.
7. Having heard nothing from [Strobbolz] by approximately 1600
hours we again sent them OPIM traffic asking that they inform
about 1430 hours of their intentions. I had previously left the office
to
thet prosonal items. I had to get came lunch and take
administration Staff) in to cover for person H. POLIAKOPP (Deputy for
them current situation. When I returned at 1600 should briefed him on the
month, the office prepared for the trip. We then sent the above-
mentioned cable and suggested that MUCIANE return to his quarters and
amait further develoued 21 hundred TOCHESKY and suggested that he
and his communicator return is not a member. IAPOLLA, in the mean-
time, had gone to Rhein/Main Airport to members. The
ing classified material and get him through Customs. In then returned
to his home. I left word with the Signal Center Watch, Officer that
agy incoming traffic on subject's trip should be telephoned immediately
to LAPOLLA who would come in, review the traffic and contact are. The
100000


14/20/2000
Watch Officer was also asked to immediately phom the Wiesbaden Com-
municator who in turn would contact TOCHENISKY and both of them would
go to their office.
8. At approximately 1900 hours LAPOLTA contacted me at home from
the Signal Genter and informed me that an KIA and other information was
in from (Stockholm) I told him to stand by and I would immediately
in. Based on (Stockholm's) abaled statement that Martin K. ROODING (Chief
27, 144
and the National Business Council) was escorting subject to the United States, (1970
told LAPOLTA) and the National Business Council. I arrived at the office at 1930
hours and immediately dispatched the House. The agreement to buy certain
types of foods and magazines that/Stockholm were not subject aboard the
intuited States-bound aircraft. We contacted TOCHENISKY and and
the National Business Council in a state of immediate readiness. David 1. MUSGALL
(COS/MUSIC) was advised with IDEMITY A. IDENTITY A was given
a general briefing on the admission and his responsibility following
which he and LAPOLTA took off immediately for Wiesbaden. They took
with them the purchases of
9. I then proceeded to the home of Ronald N. CORANEK (COS Lanyer)
where we were guests for dinner. At approximately 22,000 hours I received
a cell from LAPOLTA that subject and family had arrived, the turnover
was made, and that the KAOB aircraft was airborne at approximately 2150
hours. I telephoned this information to BENTHAN.
10. At approximately 2245 hours I received a call from the Signal
Center. The aitch Officer who relayed to me the following message from the
Wiesbaden Operator. That message stated the EAOB aircraft was
immediately returned to the, and because of a sick passenger. Immedi-
ately thereafter I received a special LAPOLTA who was at the quarters
of Arthur G. DRIENISLE (EAOB) in Wiesbaden, L. LOPOLTA stated that he
had gotten hold of the Air Base Flight Standard. He was responding to
the Air Base. He was at that time to other details. I told I in Chester
B. PAMOELLAND (COS Mucial Officer) and myself would leave immediately
for the Air Base.
11. PABORLAND (COS Mucial Officer) in attendance at the samo dinner party and we
departed immediately for the Air Base. Upon arrival at approximately
2300 hours the EAOB aircraft had already lurned and maximum security
provisions were observed in the area. Air Police had the "Hanger 34
Area" blocked off two blocks in either direction.
12. TOCHENISKY met me outside the building and informed me that
immediately after take-off subject's six-year-old daughter kind become
extremely airisk and suffered respiratory difficulties. His was
administered oxygen. The mother became hysterical and the father
demanded that the aircraft immediately be returned to its point of

departure. He further stated he would not agree to further travel
to the United States except by commercial jet. We then entered the
Operations of the of the Flight Squadron where I was introduced
to RODDIE, which is basically the same story as told by TOCHENKY.
We also ascertained that the Surgeon had looked at the daughter
and had found reaching organically in the United RODDIE to
bring FACERLIND into the room where subject's fairly
introduce him as an "Varian Intelligence Service Medical Office"
and was a great "variance the and. FACERLIND's results were the
same as the Flight Survey. In addition we given the child. A
discussion of some fifteen minutes of the work to how best to
proceed with onward transportation arrangements. RODDIE said
opportunity was especially impressed ne with the fact that subject was of the
period of the first day. His information on the matter of Soviet/Finniah
relatims was of great interest. The fact that subject deeply felt his
necessity to arrive in Washington and at the end of the formation within
the next 48 hours. RODDIE also stated he concerned when subject's feol-
ings. All RIEARK representatives then on the some again got together
immed the undersigned made the decision to abort the mission, arrange
at the entire safe-housing overnight for subject and his family, and
at the end of the first day.
13. Earlier in the LACK informed me that he had cleared out
their Eschborn safe-house in case we should need it. I immediately
tried to contact LACK by phone but there was no answer. I then phoned
Henry R. GARLINDAY (Deputy to Administration Staff) and asked him to
do for me the following things:
a. Contot Stephan R. LACKLER (OBSZOMER) and tell him we had
an immediate need to house & family of the rules, plus two
KUSARK officers at Eschborn. To further tell LACKLER to
be standing by at Opel Circle opposite the Minneapolis
Honeywell building at 0100 hours and is prepared to escort
another vehicle to Eschborn.
h. Phone BENTHAR and tell him we would drop by his house
later that evening to brief him on any developments.
e. Phone LACKAR and tell him we were using Eschborn.
14. All concerned deputed Wiesbaden Air Base at approximately
0020 hours on 17 December and arrived at the meeting point at Opel
Cirole at exactly 0100 hours. Subject's family plus MULFALL, who had
also the immediately to Westbaden, followed LACKLER's car to Eschborn.
FAGHERLIND, LAFOLLA, RODDIE, and myself went immediately to HENTHAR's
house.

15. BENTHAM was them fully briefed on developments and ROODING
gave certain operational information of a sensitive nature from subject
to MENTHAM. After necessary analysis and discussion the following
decisions were reached:
a. We would endeavor to remove the family out of Frankfurt
by commercial aircraft that day, i.e., Sunday, 17 December.
b. In the absence of the ability to accomplish this, we would
endeavor to remove them on an Air Force Modical Visualization
Flight on Monday, 18 December.
c. *seeph Q. KLEBCH (Chief, cos/ANRIO) was contacted by
phone from HENTHAM's residence and said he believed that
his people could affix in the subject's pesports a
Federal Hophilic entry stamp. This was considered neces-
sary in order to prevent embarrassing questions by German
Imagination Authorities on Sunday when the family would
depart by commercial air. The family had entered the
Federal Hophilic "blicot" and accordingly there was no
reduction of the most of their Displomatic suspents.
d. We would return LAPOLA and HODING to the safe-house and
I would also send out one enlisted guard with sidearm.
16. A cobble to Headquarters was drafted on the basis of all this
information and everyone departed the HENTHAM residence for their
disparative missions. I proceeded to the Signal Center and released the
drafted a new plan.
17. I arrived back at my quarters about 0330 hours. At about 0410
hours I received a call from KLEBCH, wanting to get in touch with
LAPOLA on matters pertaining to the documentation work he was tryin;
to accomplish. I gave him the telephone number of the Kebhorn safe-
house. It turned out that the cold weather had affected telephone com-
munications to Kebhorn and the phone was dead. KLEBCH then went c.n
* Eschhorn, a new plan was deployed with LAPOLA and HODING, I am
informed, but as yet do not know the technical reason why, that KURIO
could not put in the subjects. It was apparent the required German entry stamp.
It was decided at the meeting at the Rishhorn safe-house that KURIO
would try to make and have ready by the next morning (sufurin/8asports
for subject and his family).
18. At about 0600 hours I received a call from the Signal Center
Watch officer informing me that Headquarters "approved your plan." I
immediately tried to contact the Kebhorn safe-house by phone but to no
time. The program was completed KLZBCH at the ANRIO installation and
was then informed by him of his earlier visit to Seabhorn around O400.
He told me during his phone and the presentation that LAPOLA was going to get
up about 0700 hours. I surde the following: LAPOLA would proceed immediately
to the office and then did so myself.

19. LAPOLA arrived at the office sometime shortly after 800. The
then discussed what our possibilities were, based on the situation as
we then can it. We had no guarantee that the (Australia) passouts would
be finisned by AURJOT in the to be used by an carly afternoon United
States flag commercial jet. When the 1970s, as we had the previous
evening, contacting Mr. William Naylor, the Pantry, and the 1970s. The
in Germany and a cleared and witting contact, as to whether or not
the 1970s had board passengers without going through German Linigra-
tion, i.e., Passports, and the The question of the availability of seats
was also involved. LAPOLLA, the 1970s have a major Naylor in his
residence in kind Hamburg and explain to him we have to know
agency and ask him to come immediately to the I.G. Parben Building and
the 1970s. The 1970s was. The phone call was made and Naylor agreed
to do this. LAPOLLA was the MATS Office at Niewin/Nain to
ascertain if MATS had any commercial service of the departure that
day. He discovered that they had no commercial jet chair. The
first day, the midnight on Sunday they were dispatching a C-135 con-
figured to carry out the time he was further informed that 36 of
these seats had been given to the MATS and 3 to the Army to be
used only by single military personnel depends on the MATS. The
MATS is leave. No families could be sent on the flight. Inasmuch as
a C-135 and 300, they cargo version of a Boeing 707, LAPOLLA and myself
discovered seriously with the facility of endeavoring to get military
authority to fly this family out of the first against such course of
action for several reasons. We anticipated that the MATS was the
the observation among the single military personnel aboard the flight
when the MATS was civilians, three of whom were obviously a
family, flying on the MATS. The fact that the six-year-old
daughter spoke no English also continued to the adverse situation we
anticipated. Secondly, subject and family had already been aboard one
cargo type aircraft and were reported by JOHNE to have made a sur's
of uncomplicatory remarks of the two transportation that they were
used to be used.
20. Naylor arrived at the office at about 1000 hours and wag made
generally aware of our problem. The was informed that the principal
traveler involved was a defecting Russian diplomat, plus wife and child,
and that we were under obligations of traditionally and securely return
them to the United States by jet aircraft. The other informed
that we looked the proper documentation to board them and the Federal
MAY be enough normal clearance procedures and we had no guarantee
that we would have the documentation by flight departure time of
PAA No. 73 at 1315. We then asked him what he considered to
the possibilities of working out a procedure to board the party "plack"
and to prevent any divulgence of their existence to the Céman Imigra-
tion Authorities. After considerable discussion it appeared that there

existed a very good possibility to get the passengers aboard the air-
craft and successfully circumvent German passport controls. Maylor
contated his own assistant and the PAA Operations Officer assigned to
Rhein/Main, both of whom are United States citizens, and asked that
they proceed to the airport and stand by to assist him in the handling
of the airbag. He said he said he said, "I have the departing operating on PAA No. 73.
He then ascertained that only three first reports of the airbag were
on this flight. He told his assistant to seat two passengers in the
aircraft lounge and he would accept full responsibility for it. This
is somewhat touchy in the airlines business as lounge seats have no
safety belts. He also knew additional first class seats were available
out of the airbag.
21. In the meantime, KIRKINCK and one of his men working on the
documentation had returned to Beahhorn to take pictures of snugery and
his family that would be necessary for the (Austrian) passports. The
best reading we could got from the KURIOT people working on the douc-
ments was that they would not be ready on time. Inasmuch as decisions
had been made, we decided to set the wheels in motion and started the
airbag. He said he said, "I would slightly took off for Beahhorn and
a plan was agreed upon where he would have to be a good place."
of the Rhein/Main Departure Building at 1230 hours. Neylor would be
standing by the entrance and take the family via a circuitous airport
building route to the PAA Operations Office which is located on the
second floor of the building beyond Passport Control. Neylor departed
at about the same time as LAPOLIA and went directly to the airport.
The second floor in the sarming I had asked BERTHAN if he could effect
arrangements at the time to have a Visa Officer standing by to put
United States visitors' views of the airbag. He said he said, "I would
porta. BENTHAN accomplished this and, at Naylor's suggestion, we asked
if the Consulate Officer could go t-the PAA Operations Office at Rhein/
Main and "and by there to accomplish his visa work. By so going we
could save approximately 3 minutes time. 1 contatent Mr. Rollie White
of the Consulate Office and he agreed to most us at the airport at
12305.
23. I sent phoned BENTHAN and made his aware of our situation. It
did not look as if we would have any usable documentation to pass the
family and would have to take the chance of univarenting the Passport
Control. Our principal concern was that a German Immigration Officer
would be standing by the aircraft departure area and vould ask to see
subjoet's passport. We could not gat subject's family aboard the
regular bus that goes from the departure building to the aircraft
because there was no way we would get them to the bus loading area
without going from the Passport Control. 1230511 asked how we evaluated
an ability to withdraw gracefully at plane side if challenged by German
200


8
authorities. I told him the changes were better than even and that we
would appeal to the fact that this was a VIP party being handled out of
the regular airport procedures and that the passports had been left in
the PAA office. he would then put the party back in the vehicle that
took them out and just keep going. MENTHAN authorized us to proceed
with the "black" evacuation.
24. I then made one last call to MRIOT and told them if they could
not complete their work and get the passports to the airport by 1315
hours to forget it. with that NIELALL and myself left for Khein/Kain.
25. We arrived at Rhein/Kain exactly at 1230 hours as subject's
party was drawing up. The group was then taken by a circuitous route
to the PAA Operations office. It was ascertained that PAA No. 73 would
arrive at 1245 hours, approximately thirty minutes late.
26. During our wait at the PAA Operations Office, ROODINE got
aside three or four times and kept me continuously aware of subject's
fear that an attempt would be made to sabotage his plane. He had
no time to be given to the PAA. He was a member of the
told ROODINE be felt sure that Soviet agents would be found among some
of the employees of the commercial airlines and the management of Rhein/
Rein Airport. He mentioned the section of the HIS that works specifically
on assassinations and sabotage. He was fearful of any baggage being
referred to or any "spere baggage" that might be found aboard the
aircraft. I told ROODINE we were very empathistic but we were not about
to ask Naylor, who had now gene push further than one could be reasonably
expected to on our behalf, to off-loned the baggage of 1834 passengers
and search it.
27. Two events happened while we were waiting in the office to
bear! the parties that were of some disturbance. The airplane Captain
reported to the PAA Operations Officer that a gun was found aboard the
aircraft. He was a member of the PAA operations officer that gun belonged to
an Arred Forces courier who had carried classified motor vehicle
or
craft to Frenfurt. The airplane captain, upon being asked by Naylor
if there had been any unusual activities on the part of the passengers,
then described one party flying in the first-olass compartment. This
is not a very useful way to the very satisfying around the world
westbound. At New Delhi a United States citizen who had been
an unknown newspaper, boarded the plane with his wife and a female nurse.
The flight crew had been informed that he was an alcoholic and was being
returned to the United States at the request of the United States Embassy
at New Delhi. For part of the trip he had acted in somewhat of an
domvious fashion and had inquired some of the other passengers. The
Golyti in had investigated the situation and was of the opinion that the
overrespondent was new sufficiently drunk and looked sufficient statement
REHIT

to insult anybody. I asked the Captain if there was a purser or a
male attendant assigned to the first-class section. He stated on this
perrieular flight all cabin service personnel were female. He stated,
as the first-class section is AIA Captain was flying dead-head on the trip, has
a big burly sort of for the second, and were been, could spend most of the
trip in the lounge to watch the operation. DIDNTTY A expressed
grave reservation about now going forward with the second. If he
received the first-3.1 it was my opinion, however, that between DIDNTTY A
SOADING, and the AIA Captain that if the correspondent again
got obnacious they could have to cope with him. The regular Cap-
tain left the definite impression with the correspondent was
sufficiently drama, that he would either soon place the
safety. The statement a threat to subject's making the trip. It was,
therefore, the American ban of the trip would proceed. IDENTITY A informed
the Captain that ne was invited States Government representative escort-
ing a family aboard the plane and requested the Captain to keep the door
of the flight deck locked from the inside during the length of the
trip. To this the Captain again.
28. Subject's party, accompanied by Meylor and the PAA Operations
officer departed the office at 1325 hours, entered a PAA crew bus.
The absolutely to the first-olass ramp and successfully boarded the
airrent. 1335 KLEBACK arrived with subjects's two original
Russian passports. The time from put in a brown manila envelope and
one of Maylor's United States, and the sebition employees was asked to proceed
immediately to the aircraft and the case to ROODING.
29. At about 1300 hours we had pointed to MAIOR and told Ralph 0.
NASSBOCK that he had another thirty minutes get the (fuultria) pas-
ports to the airport because of the airport's interest in the future. The
Dairning/ Response parts arrived at approximately 1345 hours. However,
the air-closed at to enter in those passports the United State's
visitor's views. The air carefully 1355 the FAA Ground Crew since
notified PAA Operations that had been a new seminancially cleared for
departure and completely loaded. At that time, the air was effective
started to run from the Departure Building to the plane with a
major, large storage. Mayor was coming back from the plane in the over
bus. He injected the captured the PAA employee and took the gas and drove it
back to the plane. He later told us he opened the bag, one of the
flight bag variesy, and on his own initiative examined the contents.
It contained items of apparel used by ladies that will not be further
identified.
30. At 1400 the Ground Crew Chief stated again the plane was ready
for departure and asked why the plane was being held up. It was being
held up because white had not finished all the criteria on the passports.
However, the PAA Operations officer informed the Ground Crew Chief that
150000

the weight of the loaded plane had been gusstimated and they were recom-
putting total weight. At about 1405 the (Austrian) passports with United
Stavion viass were carried in a brown envelope by a PAA United States
edition employee and given to ROODKS. The plane was then cleared for
deparature and rolled out at 1414 hours.
31. The only other information known at the time of this writing
as that the aireraft was diverted to Bermuda because of bad weather
conditions in New York. Mayier telephoned me that information about
10000 hours on Monday morning, 18 December.
