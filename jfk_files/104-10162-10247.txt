to his, willly, and the other, and the other, and the other, and the
tobacco industry, and Max. All of Subject's father's brothers
except for Max, are butchers by occupation, including Subject's
father. Max graduated from CONY and became a structural engineer;
he has an office on 43rd Street and his firm is called the Amron
Associates.
The subject's mother, also of Jewish descent, came to the USA
in 1914 (on 1913). Her older sister, Fannie, is married to (fwi)
COERN who is presently retired and living in Florida. Her sister,
Ruth, married Max AMRON. Her brother, Hyman HORLIK, who arrived
in the USA only in 1922, owns a liquor store in Bayonne, New Jersey.
Subject's mother has another sister (mu) who is presently living in
Florida. Subject's mother has one brother who in still living in

employed. At the time of Subject's birth, Subject's father was
employed in the Brooklyn shipyards. However, he changed jobs
frequently and was subsequently employed on a farm near New
Brunaviscity, which was a very good mother, then as a button,
and finally became active in a Jewish community. The mother,
As Subject's father became convinced that the future of the Jews
was in Russia under Soviet Communism, in 1931 Subject's family
left the USA for the USSR for Birobidkhan where Subject's father
worked as an organism: the had sometime prior thereto graduated
from the United States. He had Bicks County, Pennsylvania).
d. According to Subject, his family returned to the USA
in 1933; the motivating reason that the United States had
naturally only a member of the subject's brother, Eugene.
Subject alleges that, because they had retained their US citizen-
ship, they experienced no problems either in leaving the USSR or
in obtaining permission to return to the USA. Moreover, Subject's
father had been the most little life in the USSR; however, Subject's
mother and sister insist that the infant they return to the USSR after
only a brief stay in the United States.
e. As a result, later in 1933 the entire AMGON family once
again returned to the USSR. Again, Subject states that they had no
problems in obtaining authorization from the Soviet government
to the United States. Upon their return to the USSR, they
established the United States, and the United States had a
of the family and a construction engineer, took Subject's father
"into his employ". Subject's father worked in this capacity, in
the construction industry, from 1933 to 1936. Sametime after the
United States had been the other worked for Komsmolk, a Nosecv
"panel board construction" outfit. The 1936 Subject's father also
worked for the Paris Camune as a shower of Subject's mother
worked during this entire period as chief of a dining establishment
in the school of foreign languages in Moscow.
f. Subject began his elementary education at the Dewitt Clinton
School in the USA where he studied until 1931; he then studied in
the Soviet secondary school in Khabarovsk, Birobidkhan, until 1933.
The University of the United States, the University of the United
School. Later in 1933 and 1934 he attended the Anglo-American School
in Moscow where he completed his 8th grade of school. He then
continued his studies from 1933 to 1936 in Public School #327 in the 24th
Bunnan Royan. In 1936 he entered the Noscov Avodorozhniy Institut
where he studied on the civil engineering faculty, to be a highway
engineer. He graduated in 1941 at which time he was sent to assist

in the construction of an airdrome in Minsk, later to the Polish
station of Janov.
6. In 1957 Subject's mother was claimed from her position
and both she and Subject's father began to feel the pressure of the
purges. Subject's father, allegedly by appealing to the then President
KALINT, succeeded in aging writing exit visas for them to the
USA. Subject to the fact that he had become a "good Communist" by
the President "bottom "thoroughly steeped" in the Carcunist philosophy,
checked to remain behind in the USSR. An important consideration,
he states, was his desire to complete his education which he was
certain he would not be able to do in the USA for economic reasons.
h. According to Subject, his father never lost his own
citizenship. Subject's mother, however, in 1936 applied for and
attained Soviet citizenship, he said, "he was a family of family
society, and his "enship" by default" although he never applied
the this in person; he alleges that although he was 18 years of age
in the time, he was "granted" Soviet citizenship by virtue of his
sister's application for her own citizenship.
1. Subject remained in Moscow price to World Var II. In April
1940 he married
Nina MOESTIVA
a bookkeeper by profession,
the use the step-dnisher of the well-known Major SEDGLEV of the
"Soviet Proletariat Resinent". A son was born to them in June 1941.
Although at this time Subject was assigned to the construction of
sorrodromes to support front line troops, he succeeded in
strings and in arranging a "EDT right" in the city, possibly to visit
the Geodetic Institutions, and the town Moscow to the front lines,
Suburc. the United States, bebed in Brent Litovsk on 22 June 1941 and as
result he was returned to Moscow on the same train via Barsanovich.
According to Subject, he was then assigned to the Moscow Military
District, to the Cidel Arestrcromoi Slubby, where he was placed in
charge of a brigade of enzclerism, and the other two of the two were
engaged in building dummy Air sites for camouflage purposes.
J. In August 1941 Subject states that he was permitted to return
to school in order to receive his diploma which was granted him in
October 1941. He was assigned to the 22nd Voyenno-Dorobnily
Othyard which was based in Nitrov but which was then assigned to
Sundal's Subject states that he was not inducted into the Soviet
allilary service allegedly because "engineers were needed" and
CRAET


because, as a member of the MTO, this was considered as equivalent
to military service. Nonetheless, in response to my querry, Subject
admitted that this was unusual as his activities were : a kind which
were performed by old women particularly since during this period,
from October 1941 to September 1942, all able-bodied Soviet males
were drafted into the Soviet army. During this period Subject lived
in the United States, the United States had been the most important
towns. According to Subject, he wore an KID uniform but wore no
insignia. He admitted that "forced treatment" was bestowed upon
him and his family when the MTO assisted him in evacuating his first
wife and son from Moscow in August 1941 to beyond the trials. (His
son by his first wife reportedly died on 11 October 1943 of diabetes.)
The President's brother 1942, Subject received an appointment to the
Moscow and Minister of the Soviet Union, the President attended in June
1043 and which he was given the article of it in its own form.
Inference. In response to my query, Subject again admitted that this
appointment was highly unusual as his background did not lend itself
to this, as appointments were made out of the various military
procedures. The Committee was a foreigner (americin), he was
fully and completedi trusted by the Soviet punitive organs who had
cleared him both for this training and the institute and for promotion
to officer status in the Soviet Amc.
1. Initially he was sent to Alater on the Volga, then to Orel
where is was assigned to the front lines in August 1943. He was given a
platoon of infantry troops in the 145th Infantry Division of the
United States. He was given a letter, in October 1943 he was vomited; he was
hit in the left forehead by the President of the United States. He was
a field hospital and then transferred to a Moscow hospital after he
had recovered sufficiently. He was reclassified after his recovery
and found suitable to continue in military service via the limitation
that he should not serve on the front lines (golden vorvi: sefemi).
In Because the wound failed to heal completely (he has a very
obvious condition) he was given a report to 1" depression, on his forehead),
he "raised" to be assigned to a single person who had a serious
he states, copplied and in January 1944 dispatched him to Tbilisi
where he was placed in a special officer's camp; he was hospitalized
again, had osteocyelitis complications, and ultimately discharged from
the Soviet military Forces. Bovever, Subject provided several
questions, the Committee, and the other image which at various
times he indicated occurred in May 1944, then he had only 1944, and even
in August 1944. (NOTE: This aspect of Subject's story bothered his
as it was obvious to the undersigned that Subject had somewhere become
confused in this aspect of his background.)

n. Upon his discharge, he was returned to the Wascor area where
he was placed in a rest herc. (although Subject admitted that there
really existed no need for this as he had recovered already prior
to his discharge). In continuing his narration, Subject inicated
that the rest of his story "sounds very strange and unbelievable"
and the subject of the subject. The subject was not the
appears and despite the shortage of Soviet men at the time (1944)
he could not "find" himself a job. He went to the KVD which did
offer kin a job in Veliki Luki cn the highways with the Scyndorg-
Proyect; however, he was not given the job by the officials.
The subject was not given the job by the subject. "The
Minister of the KVD who "tried to intercede" in Subject's behalf.
Allegedly after he was given a full physical examination, he was told
that he could not be assigned to the highway units for reasons
which were not asepi. and out to Suggest.
10. Subject then "sought out" with the Nachnity Svet with
10. Subject to the "sought to the Job with the Stocov Svet in the
Mostow Sofiet Senior Library (siet). In November 1944, at a salary
of 900 rubles, Subject began working in the field of "information
on municipal works-highway construction, architecture, sanitation,
etc. Fis immediate superior was (fui) LIEZEDZV, the bead of
the City of the Hydro-Greery Project. Subject admitted,
in reply to the resident of the Sfido-Cherry Project, the Sfido-
for several reasons. First, he was paid a salary which was unusually.
high and out of line with his qualifications. Secondly, through
paid a salary for a full-time job and position, he actually worked on
a part-time basis and was able to core and go almost as he wished.
His work also included working on abstracts and translations from
English business, primarily in the field of dams, dam construction,
and the work.
p. In June 1949 Subject states that he was dismissed from the
foregoing position after he was given the explanation that the flow of
literature from the USA, which Subject was translating, had decreased.
In the past, he was given a total of 1000 jobs in the field of the
Svev. He then found a job as a laboratory assistant in a concrete
plant where he worked from July 1949 to 23 February 1950. Because
he did not like that job, Subject states he wrote to Stalin personally
as a result of which, within less than 4 weeks, he was offered 4.5
years of work. The first year, he was a member of the Sfido-
Committee of the CP to when 'Stalin had forwarded the letter". In
reply to my query, Subject admitted that he was not concerned that,
by writing to Stalin, he would come to the attention of the Soviet
punitive organs, MWD/MED, which would undertake to investigate his
case. Accordingly, on 1 April 1950 Subject was given a job as an
SCO-ET

engineer with the Bercman District Road Department where he worked
until February 1955.
Q. After he lost his job in 1949 with the Moscow Sovt, he states
that his relations with his wife vent from had to worse and ultimately
cultivated first in a separation and latter in a divorce in 1950. In
the meantime, he was already living with
Eugenia VOLSOVA
an employe and a teacher of forenic medicine of the Moscow Medical
Institute where she was studying for her PhD and where she was
in
1950 or 1951. Hoverer, withis less than one month of their marriage,
Subject divorced her as he found out that she was a "Tad person" and
the other "Schaol" was a "Schaol" that he was a "Schaol" that
of Subject's story disturbed his very much. He was unsure of himself,
was vague on dates, details, specifics, names, etc. It was again
obvious that Subject was less than frank and open about this aspect
of his beckground. Its nartration did not sound convincing to Subject
hincic: when he began talking about "falling blindly in Love", etc.)
In 1952 he began living with another woman,
Rose MINKINA,
when he married only in late 1954 when their son was already well on
the way. MINKINA's parents and family were very strongly opposed to
the marriage because the parents held responsible party positions and
because MINKINA's brother held a sensitive position with the Soviet
electronics and aviation industries. A son was born to Subject and
MINKINA.
r. In ca 1954 (dates vague) Subject entered the Institute of
Marcina-Leninism and continued his studies for three or more years.
Though he registered for the evening sessions, he devoted a good
report of his days to study. As a result, Subject was the second
to the undersigned that he was a "Schaol" was a "Schaol" position of being
to the American state he "vished and desired" although ostensibly he
was a full-time employee of the Bauman District Road Department. While
a student at the Institute of Marziz-Leniniss, Subject and his wife
began submitting applications for a visa to visit Subject, the
in the USA. He was a "Schaol" and his wife, who is in
the USA. In the visa was to "defect" upon his arrival in the USA.
In February 1955 Subject states that he was "fired" from his job
with the Batman District because of "political unreliability". Beverer,
Subject admitted to the undersigned that the real reason for dismissal


14/0000
SECT
-7-
must have been otherwise as, had be actually been dismissed for
"political unreliability", he would not have been able to continue
his studies at the Institute of Marcin-Leninism.
s. Because Subject had communicated to his father, using
"Hidden phrases" in their letters to each other, about his wish to
be the subject of the "sacram" of the "sacram" of the "sacram"
order, Subject states, "to establish at first hand for his right"
whether Subject really wished to "defect to the USA". Subject's
father remained in the USSR for a total of 10 days. As a result
of his father's visit, Subject changed his tactics and began to
sethalt applications for "emigration" to the USA. As earlier, these
sacraminism to our intimal, but, that states that le
contact the subject.
t. After he left the Barman District place of eplogement in
February 1955, Subject found work as a "free lance translator for
the Moscow Torgovays Palata. Be earned ca 100 rubles per month
translating English language material related to the iron and steel
and steel. The first one of the most important work was "the

In August 1958 his work came to an end. Generally he
provided a concreticory account in this respect. Initially he
stated that the position had been eliminated but then changed this
story to state that he resigned in August 1958 as he would have had
to begin devoting his full time to the work. In any case, his
resignation generally coincided with his completion of studies at
the Institute of Marcin-Leninis. Thereafter, and until his
society was the most important work. He was a member of the
Konetheless, he states that he succeeded in earning no less than
about 1100 rubles per month by working as a free lance translator
for the Torgovays Palata of Moscow. He turned over to the undersigned
a sample of his translation efforts-sce the attached book. In
response to my query, Subject admitted that his work again was of
such a nature that he was a free agent, came and went as he pleased,
and generally was responsible to no one. Apparently in order to
SECT

forestall any further discussions in this regard, Subject then
stated that "if vou are thinizing that I could have worked for the
KBO at this time, then you are right because I had the time to
do anything including engaging in intelligence activities".
However, Subject then proceeded to deny that he had the or at any
time, had any relationship with the KBO (or its predecessor
organizations).
In July 1962 Subject's mother and father came to Houseco,

In September 1962 the application to the United States

4. Comments and Assessment:
a. Subject speaks native English and passes for a middle class
American. His Russian is likewise native.
b. According to Subject, his objective in life now is to work
for the US Government. Be states that he has submitted Forms 57 to
a
nuber of the US Government agencies (he did not elaborate). In
spifying for the position under AUSTERS, Subject asked for 100,000.00
per annum which is his asking price for a position with the US Government.
c. According to Subject, his present position is excellent with
great potential for going into partnership as soon as he becomes a
limited number of other industries states that he is not interested in
making money (despite his request to be a new company) but in "right-
ing economic mechanism" as an esploye of the US Government.
d. Subject admitted that he was a firm and strong believer of
Commission which, incidentally, was the reason why he remained behind
in the USCR when his parents returned to the USA in 1937. He states
that he continued to be a firm believer of Communica: unisociately
1958/99 when he became a member of the Konsomol or that he had to join the
United States. He is a member of the Konsomol or that he had to join the
Commist Party, this despite the fact that he became an officer of
the Soviet Army and despite the fact that he was accepted to stuly
at the Institute of Marxism-Leninss. Despite his alleged'researchent-
ment" with Communism, Subject spoke in flattering terms about life
in the USCR, about the "democracy", about equal opportunities, about
the excellent "educational system", et cetera. Subject asiited the

he had led almost a "charming existence" in the UCR and that
neither life in the USR nor the Soviet authorities mistreated him.
e. According to Subject, be vas never arrested in the Soviet
Union.
f. In reply to my query, Subject indicated that in 1958 the
KE tried to co-opt hin into reporting a fellow student at the
Institute of Marzins-Leninies. Boverer, Subject states that he
rejetd the pitch. In reply to various queries with vere posed
by the UCR. He said, "I think that the UCR's decision was
Subject states that he did render an inferorable report on the person.
Despite this, the particular Soviet vas intimately assigned cbreed
as an interpreter. Subject later heard that the Soviet vioried and
traveled : bota Japan ash isay.
g. In reply to a general query about life in the US8, Subject
indicated that life in the US38 has made his 1100 "en accomplished pre-
varicator".
h. Subject vas less than fluent in relating the story of his
life to the undersigned. He said justiabes frequently, be centre-
dicted himself, he sitered dat to accomonicate other aspects of
the UCR's own, but the first that he had mentioned earlier, etc.
Also, Subject repeatedly tried to digress from relating his story
into presenting his views of life; it vas a chore to keep him on
substantive matters relating to his own background.
1. Subject's brother, Eugene, is now employed as an engineer
of the Freehall Township, Rev Jersey. Additionally, he has a
private office in Rockland, New Jersey, called the Civil Engineer
Associates.
J. Subject's account of how be acquired. Surict citizenship-
see above-- is a very weak item in subject'ssery. = will have
us believe that he got Sovietism in English "y default" as a result
of the UCR's own, but the Soviet citizenship for herself.
Be himself admitted to the undersigned that this is illogical as
his brother, Eugene, whose status vas no different from Subject's,
never acquired Soviet citizenship "by default" through Subject did
allegedly without any action whatever on his own part. Moreover,
Subject admitted that he vas legally of age (12) by this time and
no longer a dependent as a result of which he would have had to apply
for a Soviet passport and for his citizenship of his own free
volition rather than through his other.

k. Subject is aware that the story of his "immigration" to
the USA is also weak. Se tried to explain this away by stating that
be "got cut by mistake", that he was permitted to go "to hide the
cigarette" of the cigarette. He said, "I think that the cigarette
committed an error", etc. Se admitted that there exists no other
explanation as to why the Soviet government would have permitted
him to leave the US3 as, in the eyes of the Soviet government, he
was a full fledged and responsible Soviet citizen who had no
grumine or legitimate claim to America citizenship. As a result,
Subject is unusually sensitive to this topic.
5. CONCLUSION:
a. In the opinion of the undersigned, Subject should not be
considered for either ASSTREEN or ASCEPLERS despite the fact both
his English and Russian are native.
b. On the basis of the interview, the undersigned feels that,
Subject is less than frank and that he is prevaricating. Moreover,
I
there exist immuerable items in Subject's tale which are indicative
both that he worked as a recruited sent of the KGB (out its
predecessor organizations) in the US3 was that he left the US3P only
to be the same as the U.S. and the U.S..
6. It should be underscomi that because of the unique and sensitive
cover used by the undersigned, to attempt was made to resolve the various
ccrtadictions, to challenge Subject on any of his statements, or to
pursze certain points of their logical conclusion. The foregoing was
obtained in the form of an interview and no real attempt could be made,
given the cover, to delve more deeply into the suspicious aspects of
Subject's background.

feet cayy of my autobiography. I hose that this will not
unduly influence the conclusions of your organization re-
lating to my employment.
Yours truly,
Jing Chinn
