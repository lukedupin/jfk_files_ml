If they remained classified. the Agency was
requested to cite the applicable exemption
category from Section 50 (B) of the F.C. and
a date when automatic decisionsification may be
accomplished. They requested that the copies
of the documents be returned with the Agency's
response:
On 26 July 1976, IPS wrote to the
NARS and returned copies of the documents.
Banks documents were found to require continued classi-
fications under E.O. 11652 Section 5(B) However,
a
sanitized version of Item #1 was found possible
and was enclosed. NARS could advise requester
of his right to appeal directly to CIA.
d. On 15 August 1976, Mr. Mahoney wrote
to the C1N and appealed the decision to with-
hold from declassification Item #2 of his
request:
3. Recommendations:
This contains TDCSDB 3/657,851 dated
12 November 1963, During the initial review, the
document was denied. The 20 to requester under
provision 5 (B) (2) of E.O. 11652, as amended: The
document is based on ACL-1832 and 10 November
1963. I recommend that the initial determination
of the amount of the document to the requester
under the 5(B) (2) of E.O. 11652, as amended,
be sustained and, provision 5 (B) (3) of E.O.
11652 now be applied. The information is from
a sensitive source with the que access to a poli-
tical leader. If released, the information could
ment and exacerbate relations with a friendly
foreign and scientific research review.
b. During the DDO appeals review, a classifi-
cation review was conducted. The document is
properly classified and properly marked in accordance
with the provisions of E.O. 11652, as amended.
Due to the sensitivity of the subject matter, a
meaningful sanitization cannot be made.

b. As stated in Paragraph 2c above, I
recommend that OGC, in their letter to requester,
correct the previous error in identifying the
deciding officials.
c. Document B-6 is a CSCI that transmits an
accumulative machine listing the FBI. This
document is updated periodically and previous
listings should be destroyed Document B-5 is
the updated and final machine listing for 1970

requester that document B-5 supercedes document
B-6 and contained the exact saze information. I
further recommend that IPS draw this matter to
the attention of the FBI so future duplicate
referencing.
d. A classification review of the five documents
listed in Tab B has been conducted. The documents
are properly marked and properly classiﬁcantly
accordance with Executive Order 11652, as amended.

Sear Sir,
This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act as amended (50.S.C.
Cetion 552).
Briefly, my request is for information that may be in your files pertaining
to a U.S. paramilitary organization known variously as the American Volunteer
Group, American Voluntary Guerrillas or Alternate Voluntary Government (all AVO).
As you know, the amended Freedom of Information Act provides that if soma
parts of a file are exempt from release, "reasonably segregable" portions shall
be provided. I therefore request that, if you determine that some of the
requested information is exempt, you provide ce immediately with the information
that can be made available. Of course, I reserve my right to appeal any such
decisions pertaining to "exempt" material.
I am prepared to pay reasonable costs for locating this information.

were located and are included in the recommendations
below. These documents were not considered during the initial
review since they were not considered to meet the criteria
for "records" extant at that time and they contained only
incidental references to the subject of the request.
d. During the appeals review we were unable to
identify any Air Force documents concerning the subject
of this request. The requester should be told that this
was apparently an error.
e. During the appeals review we were unable to
identify any Department of State documents concerning
A Quaker Action Group. Two State documents located. and
possibly referred to in the initial response, do not
concern A Quaker Action Group. The requestor should be
intormed that this was also apparently an error.
3. (C) Recommendations:
a. My specific recommendations are shown on the
Appeals Review Form attached to each document. A
classification review has been conducted and all documents
are considered properly classified and marked in accordance
with E.O. 11652, as an example.
b. The report is not the two documents denied in toto
under the initial review continue to be denied. One of
them (Tab 3) could identify a still active and sensitive
source. The other (Tab 4) was obtained through a sensitive
operation conducted jointly by American and German
authorities.

I recommend that portions of ten additional
documents located during the appoals in view be released.
Exemptions (h) (1), (b) (3) and (h) (6) should be cited,
as applicable, to the denied portions, and
recommendations on each of these documents is reflected
in the attached Appeals Review Forms. (Tabs 5-14)
D. One additional document located during the
appeals-revicw should be denied in toto, since it was
recited from a foreign liaison service. (Tab 15).
e. 88 FBI documents located during the initial
review, but not referred to the FBI, should be referred
to the FBI in writing for review and direct response.
These documents are listed under Tab 16.
f. One Department of the Army document should be
referred in writing to them for review and direct response.
The title page and a description of the document are
attached as Tab 17.
8. Five items from NSA have been referred to them by
IPS for. review. (Tab 18).
h. Several other documents turned up during both the
initial review and the appeals review should be considered
not responsive to the request since they refer to the
generic term "Quakers" but not to "A Quaker Action Group"
as specified in the request. (Tab 19).
4. (U) Mrs. Devine of OGC has concurred in the above
recommendations.

Despite the detailed explanation provided Rx. Sizerman, ve note 13 liss letter
of appeal that he coutinues to seuk a basie for the decision. With regard to
these Jocuments, ve believe and agree that roleasing them to Nr. Sjangeran
vould violate protection of sensitive sources and satches. The original
dailal 11 correct and should be upheld by the Information Review Committee.
4. Our review of the renising three documents (items f., g. and n.)
has resulted in the following recommendations.
a. THE599858. A passenger list which the Agency apparently
obtained through foreign liaison (Cemaltan). The nature of the
information, the passenger manifest of a Cuba controlled ship, does
not portid. segregating and releasing pacts of the list to Dr. Sjanceran.
We believe the document is exempt under (b) (1). (b) (3) of the FOIA and
58(1).
b. MEXICO CITY 330. Provides the same information as RMA-37509
an. is, therefore, exempt under the same exemption cited in the original
dual, i.e., (b) (1), (b) (3) and 58(1).
c. EX-3663. We believe certain parts of this 23-page document
can be aggregated and released to Mr. Sjogerman. We agree with ITG on
the selected portions that should be extracted for reloana (see attached
marked copy). The balance of the document, however, must be considered
except under (b) (3) (a) and (b) (6) of the FOIA.
5. In summary, it is recommended that the appeal be denied and the
exemptions upheld on all the related documents as listed above except in the
case of EX-3663. The selected portions should be semitized and provided to
Mr. Sjogram. This recommendation has been discussed with Mr. Markovs of the
OOC and he concurs with our decision.

MENORANDUM FOR: Freedom of Information Officer, DDO
SUBJECT:
Phillip A. Singerman
REFERENCE:
INS 75-801. (Appeal)
Request for Agency documents
1. Attached are the three Agency documents listed in
our monorandum of 14 May 1975.
Agency director (MMA-32116, dated 23 June 1980.
This adverusing this check does not mention Subject by name;
Subject's design was forwarded as an attachment to
this dispatch. Two other attachments listing Subject's
name on two flight manifests are not available here, but
the reference to his travel from Mexico city to Cuba had
been incorporated into a Special Channel memorandum to
the FBI, 3-501, dated 11 August 1969 (paragraph id of
our 14 May memorandum).
b. Agency dispatch 18MA-37509, dated 10 July 1969
listed requestor as a traveler to Cuba and listed his
passport number. It also forwarded a copy of his passport
in an attachment which is not available here.
c. Special Channel Memorandum B-561, dated 11
August 1969 (see paragraph 1a above).
2. We believe that the above mentioned documents have
been properly exempted in our 14 May nocrandusa under (b)(1)
5(B) (1) (foreign liaison, in this case, two sections of Mexican
liaison) and (b) (3). The material is not segrested in
the same manner. The material is not a separate format are
such that the requester could determine that the information
concerning him was obtained by the Agency through surreptitious
access to airline manifests and clancestine photography of
passports of U.S. citizens. Release would thus violate
protection of sensitive sources and methods (Mexican
liaison and a unilateral agent).
CONFIDENTIAL


14-00000
CONFIDENTIAL
3.
One more document (not inlexed into the 201 file or
any other records of this office) has become available:
Transmittal Manifest 599888, dated 28 August 1969, forwarded
by cos, Ottawa. This mantfest lists Subject among passengers
and their own passengers, including dispatch was used
and no source is given, but the information presented
to have been provided by foreign liaison (Canadian) and
material is thus probably exempt under (b)(1), 5(B)(1)
(foreign liaison), and is certainly exempt under (b)(3)
(intelligence methods). The format and the nature of the
information do not make it feasible to sezareite and release
it to Subject without making it possible for him to adduce the
price had access to the passenger manifest of a "human controlled
ship."
In
meridium, 18 3003, dated 23 October 1969, the internal Agency
25 page paper on the Committee of Returned Volunteers, and
refers briefly to requestor, repeating in part the reference
to requestor's travel as reported in 18MBA-37509 (paragraph
1b above), but also includes the following that he served in the
Peace Corps. The excised portion of the document is considered
exempt under (b) (3) (a) and (b) (6).
5. Also attached are copies of three additional Agency
cables. Mexico City 330, dated 24 June 1969, is referred to
in EMML-37509 (paragraph 1b above), and provides the same
information about the information that is not a particular
cited in this cable, in turn, is Headquarters 876, dated
24 June 1969, which requested that names and passports of
greups traveling to Cuba be cabled, as the information was
urgently needed for a paper being prepared for the White
House. This cable in turn refers to Mexico City 329, dated
25 June 1969, which explains the reason for the investigation
of the proposed legislation for the Although Headquarters 876
reacios City, 629, dated 25 January 1969, and the
are attached for background information.

(U) Background:
a. On 7 August 1975, Ms. Nancy Barnes wrote the
CIA requesting any information and documents that
concerns " an organization called the African Research
Group. Ms. Barnes explained that the African Research
Group is "an inactive, but still existant" research
group of which the U.S. and Mrs. Barnes also
stated: "This as an individual 1 would like to request any
information concerning my activities.
b. The b April 1976 response to Ms. Barnes stated
seven DDO documents were being released in sanitized
form. This memorandum also stated that FBI and State
Department documents had been surfaced in our search
and that these were being referred to the originating
agency for action. Ms. Barnes was also informed of her
right to appeal.
c. On 5 May 1976, Ms. Barnes appealed.
d. At the initial review, the search was limited to
information about Ms. Barnes, including any association
with the African Research Group. During the appeal review
the search was broadened to include any information about
the African Research Group, regardless of Ms. Barnes's
association with it. This later search located additional
documents which are included in this appeal package.
3. (U) Recommendations:
a. Tab A-1 contains nine overt documents that I
recommend be released to Ms. Barnes in toto.
b. Tab-B contains the DDO documents that were
considered in this appeal case. The Appeal Review Form
attached to each of the documents reflects my recommendations
concerning the release of the information in the document.
All meaningful, non-exempt information applicable to this
application, and the information is not available to release.
A classification review has been conducted on each of
the DDO documents reviewed in this appeal case. A DDO
officer with national security classification authority
has asserted that each document is properly classified and
marked in accordance with E.O. 11652, as amended.

Gene F. Wilson
CIA Information Review Committee
CIA
Washington, D.C. 20505
Dear Mr. Wilson,
On August 7, 1975, I made a request to the CIA under the
Freedom on Information Act for information, and documents pertaining to
the African Research Group and Nancy (Sam ) Parnes. By letter dated
April 6, 1976, the agency agreed to release a newspaper clipping
on the considered documents. The remainder of the requested documents
were withheld.
I hereby appeal the agency's denial of my request for
documents on the grounds that the exemptions relied upon do not
apply to the Secretary.
In reviewing whether classified information pertaining the
to the Africa Research Group is till properly classified and therefore
exempted from disclosure under subsection (b) (1), you should be
aware that the agency's opinion is not.
The additional, I have reason to believe that the agency's initial
reply is incomplete. In particular the documents released by the agency c
contain only one publication of the ARG. The documents already released
indicate that the agency was at least aware of other ARD publications.
I hereby request a copy of any catalogue, list or index of these publications.
The documents contained in this publication of documents which are withheld

Dear Sirs;
I have reason to believe the CIA may have a record file on
me.
In 1961 I was a member of an Anti-Gastro group in the Florida
Koya. And resided on No-Jame Koy in the Florida Keys for a
time.
Since I was a dovote anti-communist at the time and participated
in a read or two (that never accomplished anything), I'm
corticua to see if anything is in print regarding my so oalled
wildl outs i days and under the Proedom of Information Act
I hearty respectfully request a copy of any possible files
on me.
Respectfully,
Jim
