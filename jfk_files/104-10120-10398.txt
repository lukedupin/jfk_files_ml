After calling from the Embassy to arrange the appointment, LUERS
and KORENGOLD went to AMALRIK's apartment. The painter was
not there, and shortly after their arrival two militia men and KGB
officers came to AMALRIK's apartment. AMALRIK was arrested,
tried, and sentenced for being a 'parasite'. LUERS said that his
superior at the Embassy, Malcolm TOON, was unhappy about this
activity and was critical of LUERS in his efficiency rating because
of it. LUERS said he did not previously mention it to the interviewing
agent because he did not wish to further complicate matters. "
(LUERS was security approved as a GS-7 JOT in June 1957, subject
to technical interview, but his case was cancelled when he accepted
another position. He was subsequently granted liaison clearances in
February and March 1962.)
