2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
SECRET
20 December 1973
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt
1. I phoned Paul Burns; Special Assistant to the DDO, and
said that we had some leads that could be followed by whoever has
the action in the DDO in tracking down Hunt's activities during the
fall of 1964, when he was alleged to have been engaged in surveillance
activities of Barry Goldwater.
2. I said that our files showed Hunt was in DO Division (Burns
was not familiar with that title, but recognized it as the predecessor
of FR Division) and in August 1964 was assigned to the Washington
field office. I suggested that Stan Gaines, who was Deputy Division
Chief of DO Division and now DCOM Bonn, might he in a position to
give a few groups on what Hunt was supposed to be doing then. I
suggested that he be queried by cable. Burns said Gaines is staying
on under contract for a while, so would continue to be available.
3. I said that Fig Coleman was on the Iberian desk when the
Hunt assignment to Madrid was brought up in 1964 and when Hunt
went to the field in 1965; He could give the background on the assign-
ment, which seems to have been through Karamessines at Helms'
direction. His recollection would give leads. I told him that Coleman
became COS Madrid later, after Hunt left Spain, and could provide
information on what Hunt did not do for the Agency during that period.
I suggested that both Helms and Karamessines should be queried.
I gave as a possible press treatment that Hunt was engaged in
domestic operations (something Senator Baker is pursuing) and that
his assignment to Spain after the election could be presented as giving
him time to cool off. I thought we had to pursue the matter to be
sure we know the facts.
4. I asked Burns to be sure that we are on information distribution
of cables to the field on this, given our assigned responsibility for
keeping files on Watergate. He said we are on the PLMIPLANK for
messages to Helms. He would advise the action officer. I said we are
available for any help we can give.

MENORANDUM FOR: OPS/RMO
SUBJECT
:
Watergate File Research - Final Report.
1. The files of the immediate office of the Chief, OPS/OSG
have been checked for material relevant to the subject of this
memorandum. The check included chronological files of communi-
cations of which I was the author while assigned to Madrid, Spain
in the period July 1970 to July 1973. Nothing pertinent was found.
2. I have attempted to recollect any other details which
conceivably could be pertinent and which relate to the period
of my assignment to Madrid. The only points which I recall but
on which I have no documentation are these:
a. There were occasional joshing in inquiries made of me
by American residents of Madrid about the reported presence
in the period July 1970. It was not fully standard reply was
that I knew only what I had heard rumored. For the record,
at no time did Hunt contact me, and I have never known of his
having tried to contact any Station personnel in Spain during
the period 1970-73. I made no effort personally to ascertain
whether or not Hunt was in Spain, and I had no effort made by
any other person.
b. A Station officer, possibly Richard Ouderkirk, now
assigned to Guatemala; was given some information by an
informant in 1972 concerning reported activities in Spain
by Robert Vesco. I suggested that the information be given
informally to the Embassy's Economic Section chief, John
Oliver. That officer was charged with keeping abreast of
developments related to Vesco. The Station did not pursue
that subject, as I recall, because it was not a topic of
reportable interest, according to requirements of the period.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General
SUBJECT
: Howard Hunt
1. At the recent request of the Deputy Director for
Management and Services, the Office of Finance has searched
its records to determine if we could find any payment to
Mr. Hunt' in an amount of approximately $30,000 that required
no accounting.
2. We have searched the following records:
a. The expense runs for the period July 1964 to
June 1973 for the immediate Office of the DCI,
the immediate Office of the DD/P, FI Staff,
CI Staff, CA Staff and the Office of Security.
We have checked various items that were re-
flected in these expense records but have
identified nothing relating to Mr. Hunt.
b. The Madrid Station, JRMAVE and FR/Washington
Office accountings to determine if there were
funds passed by the Stations to Mr. Hunt during
the year he served under non-official cover in
Marid. We could find no payment to Mr. Hunt
and his' true name or his two identified
pseudonyms
c. Mr. Hunt's travel claims for the period
1960-1972 and have found nothing in these
travel claims that were not consistent with
normal travel expenses, i.e., transportation,
per diem.
d. We made a specific analysis of Mr. Hunt's
advance account for the period he was under
non-official cover (July '65-Sept '66) and have

determined that $33,500 was advanced to this
for travel and transportation of household
goods to and from Madrid with one trip to
Paris for he and his family to renew their
Spanish visas. All of this advance was fully
accounted for. However, in his accounting,
one item appeared unusual. It was an
expenditure of $1,600 for a sensitive
operation which was approved for write-off by Mr.
Desmond Fitzgerald on 1 June 1966 without

3. Also, we confirmed that no other Agency advance accounts
were established for Mr. Hunt during this period.
4. At the beginning of his non-official cover tour, it
was necessary to establish a bank account in his name. The
EUR Division accordingly requested we open an account at the
Chase Manhattan Bank in Mr. Hunt's name to receive all non-
salary payments. (Mr. Hunt had an account at Riggs National
Bank to receive his salary and allowance payments). The
following deposits were made to the account during 1965 and
1966:

All of the above have been accounted for by submission

further the amount of the overhead fruitless. One strange
aspect of the non-official cover assignment in Madrid is that
all the costs were charged to the support allotment of the
EUR Division which is not normal as non-official cover people
are usually assigned to a project. It is unusual to have a
case officer abroad for one year on an operational assignment
without him incurring operational expenditures.

6. The Office of Finance has not found operational
expenditures except for the $1,600 mentioned above.
Therefore, it is suggested that Mr. Karanesciness be questioned
as to a project or projects to which Mr. Hunt's operational
expenditures if incurred would have been charged.
7. Another possible course of action is to request the
Director to approve my asking a cleared contact at Chase
Manhattan Bank to provide a transcript of all entries into
Mr. Hunt's Chase Manhattan Bank account.
8. We are currently reviewing records of all cashier's
checks prepared and issued by Monetary to determine if any
were payable to Mr. Hunt. Hopefully this effort will be
finished by the end of the week.

20 December 1973
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt
1. I spoke with Fig Coleman about Hunt's assignment to Spain.
I had spoken with him back in August when we were inquiring into
reported activities involving Mrs. Hunt.
2. Coleman said that he got out of the War College in May 1964
(by which ho fixed the time), and took over the Iberian desk. Bill
Ryan was C/EUR (or was it WE Division at the time). In early autumn
Ryan said that he had just been informed by the DDP (Karamesines)
that Hunt was to be assigned to Madrid as DCOS, as a directed assign-
ment by Helms. A memo was prepared and sent to the COS, Jim Noel
(now retired). There was nothing further for about a month when Ryan
called Coleman in and showed him a RYBAT letter from Noel stating
that Ambassador Stanley J. Woodward would not have Hunt in the
Embassy.
3. Woodward had been the Ambassador to Uruguay when Hunt
was COS Montevideo. He had a low opinion of Hunt and was counting
the days until Hunt left. The President of Uruguay visited President
Eisenhower in the States, at which time he requested a personal favor-
that Hunt be reassigned to Montevideo. So Hunt took another tour.
Woodward was outraged, and had his revenge in 1964 when Hunt was
to be sent as DCOS to Madrid.
4. After a couple of months--early 1965--Ryan called Coleman
in and, observing that there was more than one way to skin a cat,
told him that Hunt was going to Spain under nonofficial cover. This
didn't require anything special, Ryan saying that he didn't know
much about it. It canie to him from Karamessines on Helms' order,
Hunt was to have the telephone number of the COS, but he would do
nothing for the station. Hunt was to submit administrative vouchers
for reimbursement of his expenses and they were to be paid. Coleman
said he never saw Hunt before he went out. He knows that there was
no operational reporting, to indicate that Hunt was doing anything.


14-00000
The vouchgrs were not large, although the documentation was poor.
Coleman raised the question with Ryan about his signing off, and
Ryan said he could talk to Karamessines if he wished. Because
Coleman had a close personal association with Karamessines he
did just that. He was told by Karamessines that he didn't know much
about it either--Heims said send him out." He was instructed to go
ahead.
5. In early July 1966 (4 July) Coleman went to Madrid. He
had a ten day turnover with Jim Noel. Hunt had already gone and
he did not see him. Noel said he didn't know what Hunt did, but
that Coleman need not worry because he was gone.
6. Several months ago Noel was at a seminar at which
Ambassador Woodward was also present. At the time he asked
about Hunt. Woodward said it might still be dragged into the press.
Tad Szelc had been after Woodward about the Hunt assignment to
Spain. Coleman observed that Szelc did have a long article on Hunt
in the New York Times, and the Spain assignment was mentioned,
but without any conclusions as to its significance.
7. Coleman said the RYBAT file of C/EUR may have something on
the event, but not much. A letter out and the reply, but not much more.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt--Madrid Assignment
1. On 22 February 1974, Mr. Frederick N. Evans
and the undersigned interviewed Mr. Edward Ryan,
Chief, Staff D, Deputy Director for Operations, on
the subject of Mr. E. Howard Hunt. During the period
of Mr. Hunt's assignment as a Contract and A agent
in the program, Mr. R. Hunt's assignment was a
Ryan had been the Deputy Chief of the Western European
Division, Deputy Director for Plans. The purpose of
the interview was to determine if Mr. Ryan had any
information bearing on the matter of the operational
assignment of Mr. Hunt during this period.
Mr. Ryan stated that the assignment of Mr.
Hunt was to the European Division and to Madrid was
handled by the Department of the routine processing
procedures through the Western European Division
Mr. Hunt's assignment was coordinated and directed
by Mr. Thomas Karanessines, the Assistant Deputy Director
for Plans. With regard to operational duties, Mr. Ryan
was unaware of any specific project or target for Mr.
Hunt's assignment, and the specific observation that if
Mr. Hunt produced positive intelligence on the Iberian-
target during this period that is not clear, it is responsible
for this effort within the Western European Division
were totally unaware of it.
3. Mr. Ryan stated that most of his knowledge of
Mr. Hunt's activity and the nature of his assignment
during this period came more through hearsay than
direct official knowledge. For example, he cited the
comment made by a mutual acquaintance of his and Mr.
Hunt's to the effect that Mr. Hunt stated that while
in Madrid he was going to 'play' golf and write books."
Mr. Ryan was asked specifically whether or not he was

under the impression that Mr. l'unc's writing activities
were either being encouraged or subsidized directly
by this Agency in any official effort. Mr. Ryan re-
sponded that he was personally not aware of any such
arrangement. He added as an expression of personal
opinion that Mr. l'unt had no operation? function and
his simply. ganted the opportunity to write books for
his personal gain at Government expense during this
period.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Conversation with Sam Halpern
1. I met with Sam Halpern for about 20 minutes this morning
in GG10, where he is cleaning up some details before he goes to
his new assignment as DC/DCD. I told him generally about our
attempt to reconstruct Howard Hunt's assignments and financial
transactions, and asked him particularly for recollections he may
have of Hunt's assignment in Spain in mid-1965 to the fall of 1966.
2. Halpern said that he has no recollection about such an
assignment. In June 1965 he moved from WH Division with Des
FitzGerald when he became the DD/P. At about that time
Halpern's father died and he was in New York for the funeral
and ten days of religious observations following that. He was back
in mid-June and in and out from then on as he got ready to attend
the National War College which began in August. He did not return
to. that office until the end of Juma 1966.
3. Halpern observed that during this period Karamessines
was ADDP with Helms moving up to be DDCI. He thought it entirely
possible that Helms and Karamessines could have handled this
on their own.
4. Halpern said that Evan Parker had come into the office
of the DD/P shortly before Helms became DDCI, and had returned
from Honolulu for that purpose. He stayed on for FitzGerald until
Halpern returned from the National War College. He suggested
someone might talk to Evan Parker who may have known something
about it (although he may not). He also suggested talling to Georgia.

Madrid Station records has not indicated any "Developmental

S. A. aview of all of the travel vouchers on record
a project in addition to the PCS and return vouchers,
two other accounts are on record. One account of the
covered a tricentire Hunt family to Paris "for
the ronewal of visas." and voucher covered a TDY
trip from Madrid to Washington. The return to Madrid
by Mr. Hunt from 5 January to 3 January 1966. The
vouchers states in the space provided for the citation of
the royal order number - "no travel order," the count-
ing was approved and signed by Mr. Thomas Karamess, the
thon Deputy Director for Plans. No justification or
statement of purpose for this TDY was given on the account-
ing.
Mr. Yale determined that further review of possible
sources on Identification of operational funding was in
order. Mr. Yale investigations that the entire Main
advance account on Mr. Hunt be reviewed for other possible
channels of funding. The side of the New York Chaso account.
After discussion, it was suggested that particular attention
be taken to any items connected with publishing or book
royalties. Mr. Yale noted that the royalty offset waiver
provision amended to Mr. Hunt's contract was, in his ex-
perience, somewhat unusual.
Mr. Yale was informed by the undersigned of the
intention to the Department of Edward Yvan, currently Chief,
Division D. who was at the Department of Mr. Hunt's Madrid assign-
ment, Deputy Chief of the Western and theisphere Division. Mr.
Y. Reynolds suggested that Mr. Davis Powell was interviewed.
The Committee informed Mr. Yale that this had done
and briefed Mr. and the generally negatives resulted in
the interview. Mr. Y. Reynolds recommended that Mr. Sam
Halpern be interprovised. Mr. Y. Reynolds said Mr. Halpern
was an assistant to Mr. Desmond Fitch and when the
latter was the Western Hemisphere Division. Mr. Y. Reynolds
companied Mr. Fitt. and when he became Deputy Director for
Plans. Mr. Yale recalled that subsequent to Mr. Fitzgerald's
passing that Mr. Halpern remained at the start and acted as
the President Officer for Mr. Thomas Karamess. Mr. Yale
stated that the 808 his experience, Mr. Karamessin: Mr. Yale
have delegated all the arrangins of "details" surrounding
un assignmen: at 23 Nr. Hunt's to Mr. Halpern. Mr. Yale
offered the parent's clerical observation of his surprise at

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Interview with Mr. Raymond A. Rocca
on the David St. John Novels
1. On the morning of 14 February 1974 Messrs.
Frederick Evans and Lawrence Howe interviewed Mr. Raymond
A. Rocca, Deputy Chief, Counter Intelligence Operations.
The purpose of the interview was to follow up on infor-
mation. The method in Office of Security files which stated
the belief that the Committee of the Counter Intelligence
Operations office had knowledge of the writing activities
of Mr. E. Howard Hunt. This body was composed of
in the files of the former Security Research Staff and was
attributed to Mr. Paul Gaynor, now rotired, and Mr. Beldy
Saylo.
2. During this interview Mr. Rocca was specifically
asked whether or not he had knowledge of the existence of
any form of official sponsorship or encouragement to Mr.
E. Howard Hunt to write novels to improve the image of
this Agency. Additionally, Mr. Rocca was asked whether
or not any assistance was ever requested of the Counter
Intelligence Department. He was able to provided to Mr. Hunt
or whether or not that staff had even the same time. He was
with Mr. Hunt whatsoever. In response to these questions
Mr. Rocca responded "on the record" that he has no knowledge
of the research arrangements nor at any time was he party to any
assistance to the other. The chance to Mr. Hunt, Mr.
Rocca stated that the particular section of the report, Mr.
most actively concerned in the past years was responsible
for handling a variety of tasks categorized under the area
of the research and straight." In this sense, the "image"
mission of the office, Mr. Rocca, was informatiorn cur-
rently in the media or otherwise believed to be a
effort to discredit the Agency. Mr. Rocca foels that any
assumption that Mr. Hunt was engaged in any form of Agency
sponsored image activity would have probably lead to the
conclusion that it was done under the Counter Intelligence
Operations. However, Mr. Rocca emphatically stated that
this was not the case.

3. Mr. Rocca was thoroughly candid and cooperative
during the course of this interview. He was unable to
suggest alternate means of alternative to deternino if
any official Agency sponsorship of Mr. R. R. and the
exist. Mr. Rocca did venture the opinion that he felt
that in all probability an official acquiescence on the
part of senior officials night have been involved rather
than the official sponsorship. It was agreed by all in
this direction that the nature of any informal support
given to Mr. R. would be far more difficult to define
in the absence of any formalized agreements.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Possible Agency Sponsorship of the
David St. John Novels
1. The details summarizing an interview on 4 February
1974 with Mr. Walter Pforsheimer, Curator, Historica
Intelligence Collection, were set forth in a memorandum
addressed to Mr. Steven L. Kuhn dated 6 February 1974. Mr.
Kuhn was briefed by the undersigned on this information
during the afternoon of 5 February. 1974. Later the same
meeting at Mr. Kuhn's direction, a conference was held
with Messrs. Mr. Kuhn and John Richards of the
Office of the Inspector General.
2. During this conference the speculation was entertained
that Mr. E. Howard Hunt had, in fact, been under Agency
sponsorship with the knowledge of Mr. Richard liens in his
work. 1974 on of a series of spy novels under the pseudonym,
David St. John and Mr. he accepted as a reasonable
supposition that Mr. Hunt has been a compartmented
financial arrangement authorized by scientific officials
to write these books, then it is likely that this
information is influenced after Mr. Hunt officially retired. It
specifical to the House of Human Rights retired 30 April 1970;
Subsequent to the retirement of the St. John beok appeared
in print in 1971 and another in 1972. These Hanuscripts
were apparently prepared during the time that Mr. Hunt was
employed by the Robert R. Mullen Company.
3., Minutes from the Office of the American Journal
for the 1973 to a concern of Senator Saker over an allaged
financial, and the relationship between Mr. Helas and Mr. Hunt
which continued subsequent to Mr. Hunt's formal reciroment.
Senator Saber has reportedly made reference to a paymeat
of some thirty thousand dollars with the parntthorical
comment that Mr. Heins would not have that amount of money


14-00000
to provide Mr. Hunt from his private funds. Mr. Richards
of the Inspector General Staff opinioned that if the
Agency had sponsored the St. John books, it was likely
that Mr. Edward so informed Senator Baker.
4. All possible weight to this line of speculation
is the fact that possible to publishing the last St. John
novelv, Mr. Hunt published a novel entitled, Eduardo, using
his old Agency issued alias Edward J. Hamilton. The
suggestion is that this written effort was done by Mr. Hunt
free of any fiduciary relations with the Agency involved
in the use of the St. John pen in the
S. Mr. Howard J. Osborn, Director of Security, was
briefed on the above by the undersigned in the presence of
Mr. Fuhn on the ovening of 5 February 1974.

6 February 1974
MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Steven L. Kuhn
SUBJECT
: The David St. John Novels
1. On A. February 1974, Mr. Walter Pforthoimer, Curator,
Historical Intelligence Collection, was interviewed by the
understanding of the "societal" of the Institute of Novels
written by Mr. E. Howard Hunt. This interview was taken
at your request in an effort to determine if Mr. Hunt had
acted in any capacity in cooperation with Counter Intelligence
Operations. It has previously been alleged in Office of
the 1974, Mr. K. H. and Dr. K. H. and Dr. K. H. to
of Security Research Staff, believed that Mr. Hunt had written
novels at Agency request and that this effort had been known
to Mr. James Angleton, Chief, CI Operations.
2. Mr. Pforzheimer provided a verbal summary of his
knowledge of Mr. Hunt's fictional writings under the pen
name, David St. John. Mr. Pforzheimer stated that when the
first report of the 1974, Mr. Hazaridous Duty, appeared in 1965, he
undertook to identify the "societal" of the Institute of Novels.
Pforzheimer related that he checked with a source in the copy-
right office only to find out that the true name was not given
on the copyright application. The mailing address given for
the publication is not intended to be a collection reference
discretory. The address on the copyright application is
identified with Mr. E. Howard Hunt. Mr. Pforsheimer stated
that after making the identification, he called Mr. Thomas
and Dr. K. H. and Dr. K. H. discovery. Mr. Pforzheimer
recalled from the nature of the publication that
he had uncovered a sensitive matter of senior offi. concern.
Mr. Pforzheimer stated that he then recommended to Mr.
Karamesines that "if the Agency is involved in this thing
why not see to it that Hunt leaves his address off the copy-
right applications in the future." Mr. Karamesines reportedly


accepted the suggestion and Mr. Pfortzheimer recalls that
subsequent copyright applications were submitted without
the address. Within five minutes of the conversation with-
Mr. Karamessines, Mr. Pforzheimer recalls being called by
Mr. Richard Heims, then Deputy Director of Central Intelligence.
Mr. Pforzheimer recalls the substance of the conversation as
being, "for Christ sake Walter, this is the first book to
come along and say something good about the Agency. "
not to be given to Mr. Pforzheimer.
3. The undersigned asked Mr. Pforzheimer, who to his
knowledge, would be in a position to confirm or deny whether
Mr. Hunt was under any form of Agency sponsorship in his
writing of the David St. John novels. Mr. Pfortzheimer replied
that he was never officially briefed on the matter and that
only Mr. Heims or Mr. Karamessines could provide the answer.
Mr. Pforzheimer, he asked if either Mr. Angeloton or Mr.
Rocca of Counter Intelligence Operations would have any
knowledge of this activity. Mr. Pforzheimer replied that he
doubted it seriously.
4. Mr. Pforzheimer went on to relate that he was
occasionally tasked to do research for Mr. Hunt. He recalled
on-one occasion being asked to research the Indian religious
and religious history. Mr. Pforzheimer, he said. "The
remembered that this theme figures significantly in Mr. Hunt's
subsequent novel Tower of Silenced which appeared under the
St. John pen name in 1966. Mr. Pforzheimer parenthetically
pointed out the origin of the pen name as being the names of
Mr. Hunt's two sons-David and St. John.
5. Tracing Mr. Hunt's career as sentiments, it is hoted
that he was assigned to the Office of the Deputy Director
for the 1966, which was a House DDP/Operations Group, in
February 1965. The first David St. John book was published
during 1965. From June 1965 through September 1966, Mr. Hunt
was assigned to Madrid, Spain as a Contract Agent. During
1966, three St. John books appeared in print, the highest out-
put for any year. Mr. Hunt published one book under the
St. John pseudonym in 1967, and one each in the years 1963,
1962, 1971 and 1972. Mr. Hunt officially retired as an Agency
Staff Employee effective 30 April 1970.


14/00000
6. A check of Office of Security records did not develop
any indication that any of the David St. John manuscripts were
over submitted for review in accordance with Agency regulations.
There is no documentary evidence currently available to the
Office of Security to either confirm or deny possible Agency
sponsorship of the books written by Mr. H. Howard Hunt under
the pon name, David Sc. John.

2 C FLE 9, T423
SUBJECT: General Gaynor's Recollections
1. This date, at your instruction, I called Gen. Paul F. Gaynor
to seek his recollections regarding his knowledge of the writings of
Mr. Hunt and any official who might be aware of the circumstances
of any Agency involvement in that effort.
2. Gen. Gaynor advised that his memory is not altogether clear
on the matter, and that he was "reaching, but stated that has he
reconstructs the matter:
a. He became aware that Hunt, while in WH, was accomplishing
a steady flow of�y books and that security approval was not being re-
quested on the manuscripts before submission to publishers. (He stated
that this activity continued later, as he recalls it, in CI Staff, and
agreed with idea that the volume of writings was sufficient to indicate
that a great of time was involved in Hunt's writing.) Gen. Gaynor advised
that he raised the issue "up front in on several occasions. The reaction
he received to his raising the issue was that "keep your stinking nose out
of this business. " He stated that he was lead to believe that Mr. Helms
desired to improve the image of the intelligence profession and the Agency
and that Hunt's books were a part of the program to do so. He stated that
he was never told outright that this was the case, but the responses he
received lead him to believe this was the
b. He suggested that two people might be able to assist in clearing
the issue; Ray Rocca and Walter Pistorhiner, both of whom were involved
in the "image" materials. He stated that Pistorhiner, seconded to be aware
of all the details - on an up to date basis - of Hunt's departure from the
Agency to join the public relations firm, to the degree that Gie
gained the belief that Hunt was merely moving his desk outside the building,
but being pair by the same source as before. He also advised that he kept
Miss Ethel Mendoza fairly current on what he was learning about Hunt's
decision to because she followed the case for him, and suggested that her
recall about what he had learned and when and what resulted, might be
better than his at this date: He also mentioned an incident in which Morse
Allen when he on a TDY was told by a COS to disk Headquarters to remove Hunt
from the Area because of his direct Liaison with the president of the country,
and other activities which were confounding station operations. Later, the COS
tool Morse's project about relaying the message, with the implication that
that was being received by higher authority in the Agency and the COS did not
wish to get in the middle by complaining. He said Morse would probably

c. He also suggested that another person--definitely no friend of
Hunt who might have some recall or have picked up information about
the book-writing matter might be Anita Potocki of CI Staff, formerly of
Division D: (I gather that she did not have official knowledge, but because
of her dislike for Hunt, she made it somewhat her business to follow his
career. )

SUBJECT:
Terence S. GRABANAC - Retention of
Royalties by a Contract Employee
1. You have requested the opinion of this Office in regard to
the retention of future royalties which might be carried by Terence S.
CRABANAC as a result of his literary efforts. We believe that he is
entitled to retain such royalties without an offset against his Agency
salary.
2. We have been advised by Mr. Geae Stevens, WE/Support, that
CRABANAC's cover does not include the role of a writer; CRABANAC's
cover for status will only be a light one of a retired Foreign Service
Officer. Therefore, paragraph 7 of his contract dated 4 July 1965 may
remain as written. Royalties from the fictional works that he writes as
a profitable hobby will not be emoluments received from or through his
"cover activities."
