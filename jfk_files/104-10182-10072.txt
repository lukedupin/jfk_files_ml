MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations
ATTENTION
: Associate Deputy Director for Operations
FROM
: Walter T. Lloyd
Associate General Counsel
SUBJECT
: Mitchell Livingston Werbell, III
1. As-you are aware, on the instruction of United States.
District Judge Peter Fay (Miami, Florida Division), incident to
the Drug Enforcement Administration's prosecution of Subject
for conspiracy to import and distribute multi-ton loads of
marijuana, the undersigned made detailed review of the files
of this Agency concerning Subject in August 1976. This exami-
nation was to ascertain any data that ran to Werbell's guilt or
innocence of the offense charged and any other data reflecting the
nature of the relationship between Werbell and the U.S. Government.
This latter requirement was grounded on the Court's view that
Werbell's voluntary reporting to the Agency and any government
condonation of his activities might be exculpatory in the eyes of the
jury.
2. In response, we reviewed the files, identified Agency
contacts with Subject and prepared two affidavits: one regarding
non-employment by Mr. B. DeFelice and the second regarding
Werbell's relationship to the Agency by the undersigned. Copies
are attached. During the trial the first affidavit was shown to
counsel for Werbell by DEA counsel, Mr. Sam Sheres, at which
point defendant's counsel stipulated that Werbell was never a
formal employee of the Central Intelligence Agency. Sheres
subsequently returned the affidavits to the undersigned at the
conclusion of the trial.

3, Regarding the relationship of Werbell to the Agency, as
approved by the Deputy Director, the undersigned appeared before
Judge Fay in his chambers on 31 August and under oath answered
questions of the Court concerning Werbell. A copy of the transcript
of that proceeding is attached. You will note that Judge Fay requested
that all pertinent government records be made available to the Court
for its inspection. Accordingly, copies of Agency files were reproduced,
culled for "Brady-type" documents, excised to protect sources and
methods under the "SWP case criteria" and reviewed and approved by
Assistant DD/O on the evening of 1 September. These processed
documents were then handcarried to Miami by the undersigned on
2 September 1978.
1. The undersigned advised Judge Fay at 0330 hours on
2 September that I had in my possession copies of all of the Agency
files on Werbell, had culled them as to possible "Brady" documents
and was prepared to review them with the Judge at his convenience.
He was on the bench with a tight schedule and asked that the possible
Brady documents first be reviewed by Karen Atkinson, the principal
counsel for the prosecution. The undersigned subsequently briefed
Atkinson on the nature of data in the possible Brady documents. This
resulted in a significant reduction in the number of possibles. The
undersigned gave Atkinson copies of the four unclassified OGC
documents related to the DOD revocation of Werbell's security clearance
in 1971. In addition, Office of Security documents edited and approved
by the Department of Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy
Actrequest. (Tabs A-and B of OS for the Department of Information
publications and security investigative data, were also provided
Atkinson. Due to counsel for Werbell raising an issue on Werbell's
use of a boat named "Venus" belonging to CIA, a declassified copy
of the OS short investigative report outlining data concerning Werbell's
use of the Venus to transport arms was also provided Atkinson. The
related OS Headquarters assignment document was not provided.
Related DDO documents on the ownership of Venus by the "JURE"
Cuban group were mentioned to Atkinson but not made available.
5. While the above documents were provided the Department of
Justice with the understanding they could be passed to Counsel for
Werbell due to subsequent events noted below, it is not certain that
this occurred. Specifically, the undersigned declined to release
additional "Brady" documents without consultation and instructions


from the Court. The requested meeting was put off by Judge Fay and
defendante subsequently rested their case. The DOJ had little else
to add and the case went to the jury about noon on 3 Sept mber. All
the remaining copies of Agency documents were returned to Headquarters
by the undersigned the evening of 3 September. On 4 September the
jury returned a verdict of "not guilty. As a result, the bulk of
"Brady-type" Agency documents or Werbell was not provided to
counsel for Werbell and Judge Fay reviewed no Agency documents.
It should be noted all copies of documents taken to Miami were excised
in accord with the "SWP case criteria" and on return to Headquarters,
these were destroyed by the undersigned.
6. As a related matter, on 16 November Mr. Arthur Egbert
of the Internal Security Division of the DEA contacted the undersigned
seeking background information on Werbell. The undersigned suggested
Egbert first review the files of the FBI on Werbell as most of the data
we have is contained in FBI reports. Should FBI data be insufficient
for his needs I suggested he seek access to our files in DDO and Office
of Security via the normal DEA Department of Justice liaison channels.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, SOG
Chief, DCD
Chief, LA Division
11-1002
SUBJECT
: Mitchell Livingston Werbel III
1. 1 was advised by the Justice Department on 23 February that
Werbel has been indicated and the trial is scheduled to begin on 29 March
in Miami, Florida: The charges relate to importing and distributing
quantities of marijuana. With Werbel's propensity to raise his past
affiliations with the Agency, we can anticipate problems during this trial,
An additional problem is presented because Werbel is defended by Edwin
Marger who was the defense attorney for John Hawk in the B-26 case in
Buffalo, New York in 1966. It was Edwin Marger who subpoenaed the CIA
General Counsel as a "defense witness.
2. The Justice Department has received information that a person
either currently or formerly affiliated with, the CIA has been participating
in Werbel's meetings with his attorney. It would be appreciated if all
addressees could review their holdings on Werbel and determine if there
is any validity to any recent contacts with him. I would urge that instruc-
tions be sent to Miami that no, repeat no, contact with Werbel take place
between now and the beginning of the trial.
3. It would be helpful if each addressee could prepare a summary
of the various contacts Werbel has had with CIA in the past. Please check
to see if you have any information on a Colonel Bayard who was killed in
Atlanta, Georgia during the summer of 1975. Bayard, reportedly an
associate of Werbel's, had previous contacts with the Agency. It would
be appreciated if your responses could be received by close of business
2 March.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Alleged Activities of. Walter Mackem.
1. During the week of March 9, I lunched with Mr. Wesley
Dyckman, Dyckman is a former Agency staffer currently employed
by the Drug Enforcement Agency. During the course of our lunch-
eon conversation, the name of Walter Mackem came up. Dyckman
told me that Mackem, a JOT classmate of ours, had been
told me that Mackem. a JOT classmate of ours, had been employed in the
the Agency. According to Dyckman, we have been employed in the
Washington area and the, investigator. In addition, accord-
ing the program's backmen is involved with a paramilitary activity
funded by some unnamed British source. The activity, which
Dyckman referred to as "the new land project" seeks to establish
a tax shelter on one of the out-islands. The legislation is
forcefully designed to be a new establishment of establishing a government
therefore, the backmen is supposedly involved in paramilitary training
for the forces who would participate in this paramilitary adventure
of sign. According to Dyckman, the paramilitary training supposedly
takes place in Georgia not far from Atlanta.
2. This is the extent of my conversation with Dyckman on the
above subject and I have no further information or details concern-
ing this.

25 January 1975
SUBJECT: Press Reports of Ex- CIA Employees Involvement with
Persons under Congressional Investigation
1. Press reports of Senator Lowell P. Weicker's investigation of
CIA's involvement with otier government agencies surfaced the contact
of Lucien Conein of DEA, a former employee, with an electronic manu-
facturer named Michael Morrissey. The same reports have also tied
Morrissey with a Mr. Mitchell L. WerBell, III, who, according to our
files, has claimed United States Government and CIA connections in
the past. According to DEA, WerBell recently invoked the Fifth Amend-
ment when appearing before Senator Jackson's Subcommittee investigating
DEA on whether or not he supplied arms to Robert Vesco. Also, while
the U.S. Government has been, at least one retired CIA staffer and possibly
two others may have been the most with Conein and Morrissey. The ex-
staffer is John P. Muldoon, a friend of the U.S. Government, who
private security specialist who has dealt with Morrissey in the purchase
of audio sweeping devices for his business. Muldoon was retained by
Werbell curing first half of 1974. The other two, Walter J. Mackem,
an' acquaintance of Conein's, and a Theodore J. Roussos. both of whom
were in contact with WerBell for possible employment in a scheme to
promote-the-secession of the Bahamian Island of Abaco, an enterprise
publicized in February 1975 issue of Esquire by Andrew St. George.
2. We have no information in our files on the B. R. Fox Company
or the Fox Company principals mentioned in the press accounts. We were,
however, told by DEA that Mr. Sandy Smith, Time magazine reporter,
was working on a story to the effect that the late Bernard Spindel, former
owner of the Fox Company, was previously involved in "wire tapping for
the Teamsters Union and providing explosive devices for organized crime.
Although Mr. Smith did not allege that either CIA or DEA were associated
with the Fox Company or Sondel, our DEA source said that Mr. Smith had
no intention of dropping the story and we can expect further press coverage.
3. In conclusion, there has been no CIA involvement with the
B. R. Fox Company or with Michael Morrissey. Moreover, Mr. WerBell's
claims of CIA affiliation or support over the years are simply not true.

SUBJECT: Mitchell Livingston WerBell III (201-259910)
1. Mitchell Livingston WerBell, who appeared in recent press
reports has for over a period of ten years been claiming to be a
representative of the United States Government and of CIA. The facts
do not support this contention.
2. CIA first learned of WerBell in July of 1959 when he contacted
General Cabel indicating knowledge of Cuban and Dominican affairs.
Mr. Thomas J. Flores of LA Division was put in contact with WerBell
and:considered using him as an Fl asset. A POA was granted on
7 July 1959 for this purpose. By October 1959 it was apparent that he
did not have the access to information as hoped and he apparently looked
upon his association with CIA as a means of furthering his various
business schemes. All contact was then severed.
3. From that time until the present Mr. WerBell has cropped up
in a number of nefarious activities whereby he inferred he had CIA connections
or support. He was reported to have been involved in arms sales to
Nicaragua and Guatemala, in efforts to gain recognition by certain
South American countries of the Cuban Government in Exile, and in an
abortive scheme to invade the Republic of Haiti in 1966. He also turned
up in Thailand where he contacted the COS purporting to be a counter-
insurgency expert. In 1971 the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
and the President of Defense and the President of the United States
agreement or association with the Agency, as Werbell was awaiting a hearing
before a Department of Defense Examiner related to his participation in
the abortive Haiti invasion. The Office of the General Counsel placed the
matter in perspective. Subsequently, he contacted the Agency to request
intercession on his behalf to have his security clearance reinstated which
CoD revoked because of his Haitian caper. He was told this could not be
done. In 1971 he again appeared in Thailand attempting to sell arms. In
1973 he was under investigation by U.S. Treasury Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms and by the United States Customs Service for activities
relating to possible mercenary activities in Aliaco Island. Bahamas. In
this connection Werbell contacted three ex- CIA employees, John P. Mullicon,
Walter J. Mackern and Theodore Knusos in a scheme to involve them in
the activities of an organization called the Friends of Alaco POA which is
advocating the succession of the island from the Commonwealth of Bahamas.

All three inviduals reported their involvement with the WerBell group
and had sought guidance from the Agency. In May and June they were
advised to break all ties with WerBell. On 27 June 1974 the FBI was
formally apprised of WerBell's overtures for their collaboration in
the effort to bring. Abaco's secession. In September 1974 WerBell
reportedly went to Greece to sell arms to the Greek Government.
Most recently WerBell reportedly appeared before Senator Jackson's
Sub-Committee investigating DEA and had taken the Fifth Amendment
on the question of whether or not he had supplied arms to Robert Vesco.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Meeting with Theodore Roussos on 31. August 1974
1. During subject meeting Mr. Roussos told me that
Mr. Mitchell Livingston WEBELL III called him from Atlanta
on 2. September and again on 30 August. Werbell told Roussos
that he was leaving for Athens on Saturday, 31 August in
order to try to sell arms to the Greek government. Werbell
wanted Roussos to be his advisor in this venture and to
go to Athens. Werbell indicated that he was told would
reach $5,000,000 in the 1974 report. He told me that he
said, "The "friends" (the Agency) before giving his
Werbell an answer. Werbell asked Roussos to see if his
"friends" were in favor of such arms deals with
Roussos. He was a member of the committee, who
had generally explained the telephone
on 29 August. She was a position on the telephone was negative
to Roussos participation in such a deal, and he had
be very sorry this negative reply to Werbell by telephone
before. Roussos and I met personally on 31 August.
2. During our personal meeting, Roussos explained
that Werbell intended to pursue arms sales legal and
via the required U.S. Government, which would did that
werbell decided to be possibilities to design and produce
the tobacco cause of his access to arms factories. I told
Roussos that Werbell's business activities were his own
concern. I strongly advised against her. He was asked
in this deal. He was a member of the problems which the
concerns the extent was having in Greece and the current wave
of anti-Americanism and press attacks against the CIA.
If Roussos as a former CIA officer well known in Greece
became involved in such a venture, a flap of substantial
proportions was likely complete with widespread press
play. Roussos understood and agreed not to get involved.

W. said Vorbell would probably call him from Athens that
weekend and he would give Werbell a final negative reply.
Werbell planned to meet with Greek Defense Minister
Averoff. Roussos said that if the U.S. wanted to stop
this deal that we should contact Averoff directly.
From what Werbell said, Roussos believes the arms
requested by the Greeks would be for guerrillas and
not main force units.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
VIA:
Deputy Director for Operations
SUBJECT:
Mitchell Livingston Werbell III
1. Mitchell Livingston Werbell III, who served briefly
with the OSS in WWII, has been engaged for the past several
years in arms dealings and swash-buckling promotional
activities which have brought him to the attention of various
government agencies. He has always remained within the
law by a fine edge. His latest scheme involves a Movement
for the Independence of Abaco. an island to the East of the
Bahamas. For this he has obtained apparently substantial
financial support from wealthy Americans and from a British
Corp.
2. Werbell operates through a number of front businesses
in Washington, D.C. and in Marietta, Georgia, where he owns
one outfit named Central Information Agency (CIA). In all
things, he has been a very successful};

connections with the Agency. We have just learned that
Werbell may be in possession of a one-line note from you,
stemming from a chance meeting with you at an OSS alumni
dinner, reading something like "good to see you again."
3. Three retired Agency employees are currently employed
by Werbell in various capacities. This past spring these
employees sought contact with the Agency basically to report
the information that the company is not a company that
quickly established that the matter was outside our charter
and asked these retirees to report directly to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. We also furnished the Bureau with
all the pertinent information in ou: files. It is to be
noted that somewhere in Werbell's scheme of things there
appears the ubiquitous Andrew St. George, who plans to write
a story on Abaco for True magazine.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telephone Call from John MULDOON
1. Approximately 1855 hours, 13 August 1974, a call
was received on C/WH/7's extension, 351-4221 by the Secre-
tary, Miss Annamarie Ruppert. She answered the extension
by number and the male voice asked to speak to Mr. McTighe.
The secretary asked who was calling and the caller replied
"John MULDOON. The secretary then replied that she was
not asked to speak to Mr. McTighe. The secretary was to
MULDOON's query, "Why not?" and before the secretary could
reply, MULDOON became obstinate and asked who he was speak-
ing to. Miss Ruppert replied "his secretary" and then
added that Mr. McTighe was away. When MULDOON asked where
he was asked to be the secretary, he was asked to be the secretary
to discuss that. Then MULDOON asked to speak to McTighe's
deputy and was told that there was no one around whom
MULDOON could speak to. (C/WH/7 was on leave and AC/WH/7
was not asked to be the secretary. He was asked to be the
this reply but then asked when McTighe was expected to
return. The secretary replied "within a few weeks"
(McTighe is on TDY) and then asked if she could take a
message to give to McTighe upon his return. MULDOON
became belligerent at this point, apparently thinking he
was getting the 'run around' and replied, "just tell him
to talk to Jack Anderson" and hung up.
2. AC/WH0 was briefed on the above telephone call at
1740 and 13 August. He decided no action should be taken
on 13 August. but would like to meet with C/WH/7, Al Spera,
on 14 August.
3. At 0950 hours, the following met with AC/WH0:
Mr. Natzke, Mr. Wedemeyer, Mr. Spera and Miss Lehman. In

Mitchell Livingston WERBELL, III
Reference is made to TOFIRDB-315/07634-74,
dated 10 August 1974, which reported on the growing
concern of the-Bahamian Government about renewed
secessionist activity in Abaco. In addition to the
information in reference, the official Bahamian
service, which was the source of the above report,
also provided a representative of this Agency on 7
August 1974, the following text of a memorandum it
prepared for the Secretary of the Bahamian Cabinet:
"Please be advised that on 3 August
1974, information has been received from
the 1974-1975, and the 1975-1976, the
ZOCHOWSKI, alias Chester GARY, has recently
been in touch with Mitchell L. WERBELL, and
has reported that WERBELL is still planning
unspecified revolutionary activity in Abaco.
The 1976-1977 conference is a part
of some former U.S. Government employees
and that he is trying to recruit a former
Special Services officer to promote revolu-
tionary activity in Abaco (the name of
the 1976-1978) and has been put forward as a
possibility) and there is also a suggestion
that Robert VESCHER might be financing some
of the activity.
2. The "overseas contact" described above was
identified by the Bahamian Service as the British
MI-5 representative in Washington, D.C. The Bahamian
Service did not identify the "U.S. Government employees"
referred to above.

In delivering this memorandum, Hromnell stated that whereas
the last sentence of paragraph 3 reads "by indi-

"the "Government" program. He was a member of the
possessed concerning WER BELL and c:her members of F.OA whom
he had met on 17 and 20 May 1974 in Washington, D.C. According
to Mr. Muldoon, NER BELL had hopes of establishing gaming
casinos, hotel and other tourist facilities in Abaco catering
and the hotel. He was a member of the "Government" program.
with Prime Minister Pindling of the Bahamas, however, WER BELL
is apparently persona non grata in the Bahamas; hence his
ambitions appeared to be contingent on Abacan independence.
Mr. Muldoon reported that at least on two occasions were
the
cigarettes, and the most important role in the "Government" was
affiliated
with the Agency in the activities of the FOA in support of
its independence. On several occasions, WER BELL introduced
Mr. Muldoon and Mr. Roussos as active Agency officials, implying
that the "Government" was a member of the American Government
the ains of the FOA. WER BELL also proposed to Messrs. Muldoon
and Roussos in separate conversations that they conduct a study,
involving a visit to Abaco; to determine the feasibility of
Abaco's independence and the relationship between the
"Government" and the domestic interviews with citizens of Abaco prior
to an alleged "plebiscite" on independence to take place in
Abaco on 28 June 1974. In default of the collaboration of
either Muldoon or Roussos, WER BELL hired Mr. Walter Joseph
and WER BELL, he was a member of the American Government
According to WER BELL's file, Mackem later in 1974 contacted
the Agency in an attempt to get an official policy on the
activities of the FOA. Hackem was informed that the case
comes under FBI jurisdiction, that this Act was a special
involvement of the Federal Trade Commission. He had on the matter had

SE/PCII, reported that during the weck of 9 March 1975, he

involved with a paramilitary activity funded by some unammed
British source. The activity, which Dyckman referred to as
3.45

"the new land project" sought to establish a tax shelter on
one of the ou- usians of the Caribbean by forcefully taking
over the island and establishing a government there. Mackem
is supposedly involved in the paramilitary training of forces
who would participate in this adventure. According to Dyckman,
the paramilitary training supposedly was to take place in
Georgia, where WER BELL is based.

Absher, who at that time was ACE/CC, and told him that
WER BELL was learning. Athens, on 31 August to sell arms to
the American Government. WER BELL wanted Roussos to be his
advisor in this venture and to go to Athens. The U.S. Army held
WER BELL that he would check with the giving him an answer.
WER BELL asked Roussos to fill the Agency was in favor of
such an arms deal. The U.S. Army had the Agency was against
Roussos. This involved in this deal. Roussos told Mr. Absher
that understood and agreed not to get involved. Roussos
would that WER BELL would probably call him from Athens and he
would give WER BELL a final negative.

be in possession of a one-line force from former CIA Director
William Colby stemming from chance meeting with the Director
at an OSS alumina. The reading something like "Good to see
the U.S. Army. This note was apparently used by WER BELL to
suggest that he and Mr. Colby were good friends. This infor-
mation was passed on to Mr. Colby on 9 August 1974.
10. According to reporting from the National Stations, WER BELL
and Arthur L. Smith (a cohort of WER BELL's) were in several
Central American countries. During August and early September.
WER BELL was a very close activity appeared to be contacting
officials of the governments of Guatemala, Nicaragua, and
El Salvador for the purpose of obtaining the National Sign of a
de facto Cuban Government in con- the "United
Organization of Government in the USA of Cuba." In discussions with
the American Government representatives, WER BELL claimed the
proposed Cuban Government in exile had been a major role in
separate Cuban exile organiza- tive and 186,000 Cuban exiles.
WER BELL offered a representative of the Nicaraguan Government
$100,000 to obtain. Government's recognition of the Cuban

carly January 1966, particularly mission was the assassination
of Fidel Casca. With the secondary mission of blowing up the
gentle of the state that supply electricity to Havana, Cuba
can't think that supply electricity to Havana, the "agreement light"
the time, stated that he was trying to be inferred that the

CIA. Mr. Baker said that the understood from WER BELL that he
would have to get a security clearance to fly for WER BELL.

3. Mitchell Livingsten WERRELL III, the principal
owner of arms manufacturing firm Defense. Systems
International and an international arm. dealer, has been
encouraging a commercial and American citizens on the island
of Abaco who seek to secure the sale of Commonwealth
In this affair WERRELL has been collaborating in the
group based in Miani called the "Friends of Abaco".
Active in the Friends of Abaco is Michael OLIVER, a wealthy
land developer residing at 2089 E1 Rancho Drive, Carson City,
Nevada, OLIVER, a naturalized U. S. citizen, was born
Noses 4.1999, and a former president.
In encouraging persons in Naco to stock
independence of Nassau, OLIVER's apparent notive is to
establish a prototype government based on principles of
free enterprise expoundied in a paperback book which he
has authored called "A New Constitution for a New Country"
and the American Survey - 1963). HERBELL, on the
other hand, has privately owned the American Republic of
a tourist necca on Abaco to include hotels, recreational
facilities and gambling casinos. Officials of lolliday
international, a Baltimore firm specialized in recreation
and health spa, have been briefed by HERBELL and OLIVER
recently on the Abaco movement. Robert A. C. HAWILTON,
18th Lord of Echhaven and Stenton and a member of the

Friends of Abaco, on 10 June 1974 sponsored a resolution
in behalf of the Abaco Independence Movement on the floor
of the British House of Lords, following conversations
with MERRELL in Washington in late May.
5. Despite the sceining innocence of the enterprise,
however, the "improvement" of MERRELL, in particular,
has made a concerted effort into the community, the
affiliates with this Agency in the activities of the
Friends of Abaco in support of Abaco's independence.
On several occasions, involving at least two former
officers of this organization, MOLDOON and ROUSSOS cited
above. They also has introduced them as presumably active
to every officials in such a fashion as to imply, according
to the persons involved, that either this Agency or the
United States Government supports the aims of the
Friends of Abaco.
6. Most recently, MERRELL hus proposed to both
retired officers in separate conversations that they
conduct a study of the members of the President's main
concerns of Abaco's independence in political and
economic terms. The study would include interviews with
citizens on Abaco prior to an alleged "plebiscite" on
independence to take place in Abaco on 2S June 1974.
To be included in the investigation is research on the
probable recition in the United Nations Organization to
a petition for the "improvement" of the President's report on
independent notably any parallels to be found in
precise words such as the Biafra secession from Nigeria.
7. Andrew ST. GEORGE, a nationally known free-lance
writer, has become active in WERRELL's organization and
claims to be preparing an article on WERRELL and the
Abaco movement for publication in True Nairazine.
ST. GEORGE has participated in the several meetings that

Memorandum for the Record
Subject: Agency Retiree's Involvement with
Abaco Independence Group
1. Through the intermediary of Robert Brown, DC/EA,
and retired staffer Jack "Red" Stent, I was put in touch
on 22 May 1974 with John MULDOON, another retired staffer
who is now nominal vice-president of a Washington-based
firm called "Security Consultants International."
Muldoon made the contact with me apparently on the
advice of Bob Brown and Red Stent whose counsel he
somewhat an effort to protect himself from the possible
complication of the "SPECIALIST" of the "SPECIALIST" of
the independence of the Bahamian Commonwealth island of
Abaco. We met at 1100 hours at "Tony's" on L street
and 18th N.W. in downtown Washington. Red Stent was
there to introduce me to Muldoon but he did not participate
in the discussion.
The "SPECIALIST" represented me with a typewritten report
containing the essential data he possessed concerning
a group of individuals with whom he had met on Friday,
17. May 1974 in Washington. Attending the meeting with
Muldoon on that occasion were Mitchell WERBELL III (aka
"Mitch Three"), Lord and Lady BELLHAVEN (alleged British
Arab, 1974) and the National Council of the
European, possibly French, origin who currently resides
in Carson City, Nevada), Howard HANDELMAN (Washington
correspondent of "U.S. News and World Report"), Renee
(Inu) (the evening's object of Werbell's seemingly
unmeted by the American American Association of the
Congress whom Muldoon chose not to identify to me. At
a subsequent meeting on Monday, 20 May 1974, Muldoon
had lunch with WERBELL and free lance writer Andrew St.
GEORGE who is also involved with WERBELL in the Abaco
independence enterprise. The Werbell group is known
as the "Friends of Abaco" (already documented as such
in our files).

3. A. of the background of the principals
is essential to a comprehension of the affair as recounted
by Muldoon:
a. Island of Abaco - From available file
information we know that Abaco is a small island at the
north end of the Bahamas archipelago a short distance
off the Florida coast which was populated in 1785 by
British Loyalists and their Black slaves filed in 1785 by
United States following independence. The island remains
in the same way. The American service in anticipation of
the Bahamas' independence from Great Britain, the residents
of Abaco, both white and black, have found themselves -
since independence - the object of apparent antagonism
and administrative neglect of the American living
of the American medical task of secession from
Russia rule. This talk has been institutionalized in an
indigenous organization headed by a white, Charles "Chuck"
HALL, and-called the Abaco Independence Movement (ATM)
HALL is a resident of Marsh Grove, the country cross roads
which poses as the metropolitan capital of Abaco, he
frequently visits the American community.
The English MERRELL III - A Philadelphia,
WERRELL was a member of OSS in the Far East during World
War II where, according to Muldoon, he came to know the
Director and Lou Concin. Werbell currently a resident
of Atlanta, now is president of an international arms
peddling firm called the American community. The US
U.S. Government of the Industrial security svstems, according to
MULDOON, DIS sells automatic weapons (including a minia-
ture machine pistol with a silencer) and bonb-booby-trapped
items of various sorts (e.g., a tennis ball with a fuse
of the American community) and a series of new
and other James Bondian accessories. Werbell hopes to
establish gaming casinos, hotels and other tourist
facilities in Abaco catering to the U.S. tourist crowd
available for easy ferrying and the American community.
Consequence of some of the with Princ Minister Michael
Pindling, however, theerbell is apparently permanently
persona non great, in the Bahamas; hence his ambitions
appear to be con- in the American independence.
The American OLIVER - The financial angel of the
"Friends of Abaco," Oliver's origins and auspices are
somewhat obscure to Muldoon. OLIVER claims to have spent

time in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II;
he speaks excellent French; he has a pet political
theory which he has published. He is seeking some
political entity where he can put his theory into
practice to illustrate to the U.S. government that it
is worth practicing in this country. In contrast to
his colleague Mitch Three Werbell, however, he seems
adamantly opposed the U.S. government. He said.
d. Lore and Lady BELHAVEN - A member of
the British House of Lords, RELLHAVEN plans to make
a speech there, following his return to London on 22
May 1974; castigating the British government for
allowing Abaco to, be abused bv Nassau. BELLHAVEN
appears to be identical with Robert Anthony Carmichael
Berg, and the British Government. He said. "The

MOSELEY (whose claim to fame remains- to be 'probated)
This information comes from several tomes on the
English peerage which were researched for me by Sally
Ann Brown of E/BC.
e. Howard HAVENLMAN - The U.S. News and
World Report correspondent also has contacts with the
Agency, a fact which has been the most important
role in the British investigation Agency - An Atlanta
detective Agency established a few years ago by Howard
COSGROVE, a former Georgia police officer specialized
in narcotics operations who was apparently fired from
the force for reasons unknown to Muldoon. COSGROVE
retains a 261 interest in the CIA (sic); Mitchell
NERRELL IV ("Mitch Four") holds another 263 re-
searcher of the British American Association president of
"CIA," a retired Army colonel named Byer or Briar. The
"CIA" has in turn established Security Consultants Inter-
national, as a Washington-based wholly owned subsidiary.
SCI's specialities are anti-audio sweeps and electronic
surveillance using devices developed by one David MORISSY,
an electronics engineer who collaborates with WULDOON &
"CAJ.
4. The incident which alarmed Muldoon occurred
during the Friday gathering of the individuals mentioned
in paragraph two. Muldoon was pained off by Werbell at
this gathering as an "official of the CIA (Central.

SEORET


Intelligence Agency, in this instance)" who was there
to attest to the fact that neither the CIA nor the U.S.
Government is. opposed to Abacan independence. His
interlocutors, despite Muldoon's protests that he was
retired from CIA and in no way represented U.S. government
interests respecting Abaco, seemed anxious - he felt -
to accept his presence there as evidence of U.S.
government endorsedment of the Abacan independence movement.
5. Muldoon took some pains to gain reassurance that
he was able to attend by Werbell as the source of
this information if any, he said.
assured him that, apart from the particular incident on
17 May 1974, the general outlines of WERBELL and his
activities and-aspirations for Abaco have already been
reported by two or three other sources. Since there is
a major problem in the case of the U.S. government, this juncture
about WERBELL's apparent effort to con- the U.S. reporters
into thinking that the CIA was backing the Abaco
independence venture, I told Muldoon. I planned merely
to make his side of this story a matter of record and
let it go at that.
6. To cap off the story, Red Stent invited us to
lunch at the Class Reunion on Eye Street and 15th. When
Muldoon's work was led to meet Stent we found him ensconced
at a corner table with three other people. Red rushed
over to inform us that he would be introducing me as a
colleague of his from AEROJET. He then presented me to
the U.S. government. "Patricia BOTOND and Cecil BRONNLOW
of "Aviation Weekly, and the U.S. government told World
like Jerry Colonna, was intent on the task of seducing
Miss BOTOND, who happened to be promoting a convention
for the Atlantic Union organization, a political enterprise
in the U.S. government. He survived Federalists Movement,
Miss BOTOND, as it turned out to be a major problem in China,
at the same time as Stent. Red had attended school with
her brother - the German School in Shanghai. Miss BOTOND
had been expelled from the German school in the late 1930s
for having been arrested in the U.S. government.
Brownlow had helped Red obtain aerial photos of the
ChiCom consulate compound in Geneva in the early 1960s
when Red was stationed in Paris. When Werbell had
wearied of the reminiscences of Stent and Botond and had
managed to hustle his prey off to a private table, Stent
was not known that I was not AEROJET but CIA.
Fortunately the men was mumbled at the introduction so that
no one could have repeated it. No one in fact seemed
interested.

7. Following lunch Muldoon let't with a colleague
for a meeting at the Justice Department to determine
whether in sweeping Embassy buildings in Washington he
must register as an agent of a foreign government
(whichever it might be). Brownlow went about his
business. Stent paid for the lunch. I returned to
what Stent whimsically refers to as the "Funny Farm."
Jone's regret is that George Orwell could not have
joined us for that lunch.

PERSONA: AND CONFICENTIAL
/
Decuber 9, 1973
Interim Report - Period of
12/3/73 - 12/9/73
RE: Current Bahamian Situation
At Miami, Florida
Results of the Inquiry:
The following people were contacted by the writer:
Jay Mallin (December 3, 1973.) Mallin states that to the
best of his knowledge there are only two groups known to be active in the
Abaco Movement--the group that WerBel (Mitchell Livingston WerBel III) is
associated with and a group being headed up by a Bob Brown.
Brown is currently in Washington and is about to return to his home
which is in Boulder, Colorado. Mallin indicated that if anything were about
to occur Brown would certainly be in the Miami area.
Brown is a white American and an ex-Special Forces type. He has
formed a group of ex-Special Forces Specialists that in Mallin's opinion
"could really raise Hell." Brown, according to Mallin, has been working for
Chuck Hall. However, Hall is also aligned with WerBel.
3.2.


Mallin states : :all of the planning sessions r Brown's group
have been held in the living room of Mallin's Coral Gables home.
Brown's group is all white but he has been in contact with some of
the local Blacks in Abaco. The Blacks have had no formal training nor do
they possess the proper weapons for any sizable operation. In order to
obtain weapons and training the Blacks have made friendly overtures to Brown's
group.
Mallin stated that some of the local Blacks could move on their own
but he believes that it would be highly unlikely.
Mallin speculated. that U.S. Mafia money may be being spent in the
Bahamas in order to finance the overthrow of Pindling's government to stop
the seizure of the casinos. He did not have any evidence to substantiate the
theory.
In answer to a-direct question from the writer Mallin further commented
that Paul Bethal is totally out of the Abaco situation. Bethal's only role,
according to Mallin, was the one meeting he arranged for WerBel, Hall, a Michael
Lightbourne (Phonetic) and George Wackenhut. Bethal, Mallin further stated,
try's to give people the impression that he has very high level connections
including members of the National Security Council and that he prepares papers
and other briefings for the Council. Mallin states that this is not true, that
Bethal in fact has no such contacts.
Mallin went on to say that WerBel would not get involved with anything
that would jeopardize his U.S. government contracts especially the sale of
his silencer to the Army. In addition, according to Mallin, WerBel is a CIA
information and would advise the Agency of his activities. On December 9, 1973,
Mallin was recontacted by the writer. Chuck Hall travels to Miami a great
deal and contacts Mallin when he does. Mallin said his last contact with Hall
was about two months ago. Nall's supporters are mainly white although
3.2


there are a couple of i <ks. Hall is publishing a min,raphed newsletter
under the name u. the /baco Independent Movement.
Millin indicated that, "the whites cannot do anything in Abaco
without everyone knowing about it."
There has been a series of theits of weapons in the Bahamas and
Mallin believes that Black militants could possibly be involved. Mallin
further believes that there may in fact be a Black militant group operating in
the Abaco area.
Mallin stated that, "VerBel's bringing in of Colin Mitchell was just
a lot of noise." He went on to say Mitchell did not accomplish anything.
David W. Wike, Associate Security Director, University of Miami.
Wike has not heard of any unusual activity in the Bahamas. In answer to a
direct question from the writer Wike stated that the only member of the Uni-
versity community known to be travelling to the Bahamas frequently is a
student who is a suspected narcotics dealer. Also, no prominent Bahamian
personalities or members of their families are known to be attending the
University.
John L. Curtin, Gade County Public Safety Department. Curtin
states that, "the trouble has been building for the last six to eight months."
He believes a direct assault would have to be made on Nassau itself in
order to accomplish the desired objective of stopping the seizure of the
casinos. Curtin further stated that the Mafia has been "buying guns like
crazy." On December 5, 1973, Curtin was recontacted due to the fact that
he had dinner with a prominent Bahamian businessman who is known to be in
the lumber business. This businessman is white but is well liked by the
Blacks in the Bahamas. His identity is unknown to the writer.
3.2


This business: stated that there is definite increased activity
but that no specific jite for any overt action he. ten mentioned.
This businessman believes that Mafia money is on important factor and
that Blacks will be hired 'o do the actual fighting if there is any fighting.
He views the casing issue as the crucial one. He believes Blacks who are
opportunistic will seize upon the casino issue to obtain weapons and money
from the Mafia and attempt to seize power.
Dr. David Carteno, Sociology Instructor, University of Miami.
Cartano was contacted due to his being a past member of the Institute for the
Study of Change. When he first became associated with the Institute he
was introduced by Pallin as being a Bahamian specialist.
Cartano could not contribute anything pertinent to this inquiry. He
has not renewed his contacts in the Islands in over one year's time. He does
have two Bahamian students in one of his classes but neither of them has
mentioned anything cf any significance. He doubts their value as sources.
Gordon 0. Rothwell, Chief of Security, Sheraton Four Ambassador
Hotel. Rothwell could not contribute anything pertinent to this inquiry. In
addition no prominent Bahamas are presently or have been recently in the
hotel.
W. Bruce Wrightson, Chief of Security, Sheraton Royal Biscayne
Hotel. No prominent Bahamians are presently or have been recently in the
hotel.
A confidential local law enforcement source indicated that
an attorney in West Palm Beach is selling automatic weapons. He is free
lancing and has a small warehouse with two separate alarm systems installed
on the warehouse.
