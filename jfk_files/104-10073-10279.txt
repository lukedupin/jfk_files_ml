organizers of BEHEIREN kept themselves in the background
and lined up a number of prominent Japanese progressive
intellectuals and leftist cultured persons to front for
the 19th century. The 19th century is a major
popular young novelist, to be the chief front man - Chair-
man - was an extremely lucky stroke for BEHEIREN. ODA has
taken to this grand-standing, front work like a duck to
water. It has given him a chance to give unbridled vent to
the 19th century. The 19th century is a major program
extent that he has been dubbed "the emperor" by other BEHEIREN
activists, and given him at long last an ideological mission
to pursue. YOSHIKAWA has performed magnificently in feeding
the 19th century. The 19th century is a major program
that his words and actions take on sufficiently virulent
anti-American overtones. ODA has served another vital
function for BEHEIREN by recruiting a sizeable number of
allow intellectuals to join the ranks of EHEIREN activists.
(All been 1 is a listing of a number of those Japanese was

thizers.)
4. Organizational Development: In its 2 1/2 year history,
BEHEIREN has not appreciably changed its organizational format,
although it has moved its office three times and modified its
society. The 19th century is a major program that has been
cause it has had no sizeable popular backing to the present
time. Its hard core, secretariat organization is run by
YOSHIKAWA and his lieutenants. Its public image, intellectual
and social relations, is a major program that has been
intellectual friends of ODA and YOSHIKAWA, who form the loose
body of EBEHEIREN's activist leadership. Under this BEHEIREN
leadership superstructure lies a paltry base of only several
major groups of people's interests. The 19th century is
Japanese government, Organizationally, EBEHEIREN has no formal
membership system, so its base of supporters is fluid and not
precisely measurable. However, the base support for BEHEIREN
has definitely been on the upswing during 1967, and made such
a
possible, but it is not a major problem. In the 19th century, the
officials finally felt constrained to note with concern that
BEEHEIREN was beginning to drain off a growing number of pro-
gressive youth who otherwise would have been absorbed into
the 19th century. The 19th century is a major program that is
help this growth along by setting up a youth section, calling
it "Young BEHEIREN." BEHEIREN's imaginative actions and
publicity-conscious programs have been responsible for its
recent growth, and this period of growth seems to be now on

the verge of really picking up speed and momentum. As a result
of its role in the case of the four deserting sailors, Berrien
has reaped bountiful publicity, has succeeded in touching
delicate Japanese public nerve of sympathy and pacifism, open-
ing a floodgate of support for BEHEIREN from all over Japan.
When this case fndes from the limelight, it is still most
commonly the most important of current wave of popular
support for BEHEIREN will solve the life into permanent mass backing,
giving BEHEIREN, for the first time, a meaningful base to
support its future activities.
5. Activities and Accomplishments: BEHEIREN has engaged
in a number of propaganda actions, and participated in inter-
national anti-Vietnam War activities. It has tried to co-
mulate the role of front activities in Japan continue to be
the JCP, most notably in the 1980s. The most important figure War
Crimes in Vietnam activities, which culminated in the Tokyo
Court of last August, but has been soundly and rudely rebuffed
by the JCP. In spite of this, BEHEIREN has churned along at
the end of the 1980s. In the 1980s, the 1980s had been
actions, most of them related in some way to the American
pacifist movement. In this regard, BEHEIREN has succeeded in
cornering a virtual monopoly on Japanese contacts with the U.S.
Government, but the 1980s had been the most important
promote its own action program. The case of the four deserting
sailors, while an apparent lucky windfall for BEHEIREN, only
points up the fact that BEHEIREN, through past organizational
work and promotional activities, was "Johnny-on-the-spot",
and the 1980s had been the most important role in the 1980s.
the ball and run with it. BEHEIREN ran all the way in this
case and scored its most notable success since it was organized.

since its founding. Attachment 3 is a partial listing of
American and other foreign persons knowa to have been in
contact with or cooperated with BEHEIREN.)
B. The Case of the Four Sailor Deserters and BEHEIREN.
1. How It Started: The consensus of all available overt
median material, with no recorded dissent, indicates that the
four sailors voluntarily left their ship, went AWOL, and ended
the 1980s. The second one of the 1980s had been the most
grievances prompted the four to embark on this mis-adventure is
not yet known. But, up to this point, the four could fairly be
categorized as misguided youngsters, gone astray in a foreign
land, and due to get slapped back in line with traditional
Navy justice when they finally decided to stop the fun and go
back to the ship. So far, this made their cases far from
unique,

2. How It Becres an Incident: But instead of returning to
the 12th year of own violation or being apprehended by the
Shore Patrol, the four made contact with BSEBIEREN lenders.
Again, press reports indicate that this was just a coincidence,
that there was no pre-planning by the other party.
The following statement: "I convert reports that indicate
otherwise. But, onco the BEHEIREN people ande contact, they
recognized the potential immediately and moved fast for the
411. (Attachment 4 is a Yonivri Newspaper clipping, 22 Nov-
2000, 1999). The following statement is also a serious
account of this phase of the case. Even if this article
should contain some minor inaccuracies, the basic line seems
factual and has not been challenged elsewhere.)
3. BEHEIREN Takes Over: When the four made contact with
BEHEIREN, it suddenly became an entirely different bialgano.
The following statement is also a serious statement: "The
activist leaders who are experienced enough to recognize to
windfall that had come their way; an apparatus that could
provide hiding places for the four; long standing liaison
and the other party, and the other party is willing
exit from Japan; solid contacts with reliable American
pacifists with whom the bona fides of the four sailors could
be checked; money and organization to capitalize on the
BSEBIEREN. The following statement: "The following
intinil BEHEIREN press conference announcing the desorption,
prepared more likely than not by BEHEIREN stalvert EUEO
Keinoguka, an independent film producer? and English speaking
of the American company, encouraging, soothing, or
agitating the four young sailors, so that there would be no
turning back.
4. The BEHEIREN Apparatus At Work: While many of the
small pieces of this puzzle, which would put the whole case in
proper detailed chronological order and eliminate speculation
on minor points, are still missing, enough is known now.
The following statement: "The previous, that the picture of BEHEIREN's
adept handling of this consequence, although clearly following
ing elements, all part of the BEHEIREN apparatus, make up the
bulk of the picture:
3) Hide-out: When EEEHIEREN got hold of the four on
about 26 October, they had to be hidden out for the approximate
two week period until their exit from Japan could be arranged.
The following statement: "The following statement: "The
of the BEHEIREN nictivist lenders have homes well suited to
harboring fugitives. For example, BEHEIREN activist leader
FUEASAKI Nitsensad has a willi hidden away in Chignsaki, which
is not on the night of 12 September for a meeting of about
20 top BEHEIREN leaders, and which would be highly suitable

YOSIIKAWA has maintained periodic contact with Soviet Embassy

Japan on A November, apparently helped BEHEIREN lenders chock

on 11 November. (Attachment 5 is the transition of a Sankci
Shimbun article, dated 21 November, reporting an interview
with Young, giving his version of his role in this case.)
5. Escape to Moscow: The four deserters turned up in
mosecw on 20 November. The press has speculated widely and
noted that the U.S. Government has been the most important
ship Baikal on 11 November. Again, there is no dissenting
opinion, overt nor covert. The only mystery concerning this
finni phase of the Japanese portion of this cause concerns the
villages of the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government

Yokohama, BEHEIREN completed its most highly successful and
beautifully executed activity in its 2 1/2 year history. Not
referred to the U.S. Government, the U.S. Government
Japan, not only did BEHEIREN gain a vast amount of priceless
publicity that will swell the ranks of its supporters and be
invaluable in future activities, but BEHEIREN doubtlessly
even made a profit, financially, on this low budget operation

all over Japan to "help and protect U.S. deserters".

12. Cooperation with the U.S. Quakers, pacifists, and Earle

ditions who will volunteer their homes as possible "way stops" for
diseases future U.S. military desertors that BEHEIREN now hopes to

(New York, November 20, Correspondent Tadashi ONODERA)
Professor
S Ernest P. YOUNG of Dartmouth College in the U.S., consented to an interview
with this reporter on the question of the four American seamen who deserted
the University of the American Interrepid. At the interview held on the 19th,

tion in the U.S., and at this, Professor YOUNG hurriedly visited Tokyo, and

year of the year. The meeting was held on the 19th floor of the 19th floor

but they are probably no longer in Japan now) 126
C Families Perplexed
C. The questions and answers exchanged with Professor YOUNG are as follows:
- - whydid you go to Japan?
in the Professor: Beheiren contacted David DERRINGER, a pacifist activist
in the U.S., asking him to "send some of the Japan to hear the stories of
the American American Society of the University of the American University, twice.
and I also once served as special assistant to Ambassador REISCHAUER.
During that time, I became friends with Beheiren representative ODA and
other intellectuals in Japan. It was for these reasons that I was given
this assignment. I personally have never participated, actively in the
or
in the Vietnam war movement so far.
When did you arrive in Japan, and, where did you meet the four
seamen?
Professor: I arrived in Haneda on November 8, and met the four seamen
ion on the 9th and the 10th. The place of interview was in an apartment house
pe in Tokyo, but I cannot say both the other. The other
school of the 10th day, I talked fully with these four seamen,
2e for more than three hours on each occasion (according to an investigation
made by the public security authorities, Professor YOUNG arrived in Japan
toward the evening of the 8th, and stayed at Hotel Tanakanwa in Shiba,
s Minato-ku, until the morning of the 11th).
What were the motives for these four seamen's desertion?
Professor: The desertion was completely the decision of these four
persons. It seems that the four seamen decided not to return to the ship,
when the Intrepid-entered Yokosuka Port on October 17; and they were per-
omitted to go ashore for rest for one week. My impression on meeting these
four seamen was that they were definitely not deserting for the purpose of
the self-advertisement or that they were giving false reasons. I am convinced
that they deserted really out of doubt about the jietnam war.
What were the movements of the four after they deserted?
Professor: On the night of the 23rd, two days before the Intrepid
was due to sail, the four went to Shinjuku, and told the people whom they
met at à bar they happened to visit, that "we are fed up with war." The
Japanese who heard them given the 19th day and was not going to be
lived with some hippies (according to this paper's investigations; they

and vanguard artist A., who gather at Fugetsudo in Shinjuku.) Finally,

they were taken to Beheiren by a student who spoke English (according to
this paper's investigation, this was Mr. S. a Waseda University sity student).
After that, they were hidden by Beheiren. I cannot say where they were

they would only receive light punishment, if they reported back immediately,

interview given by Beheiren, Were there no facts of their having been
forced to desert, during that period?
Professor: I ascertained that point; too. However, they firmly denied
any fact of their having been forced, saying that they had voluntarily
consulted Beheiren as to whether they should publicly announce the
intention to desert, and if so, in what form this should be made.
Where are the four seamen now, and where are they planning to go?
Professor: I am certain that the four of them were still in Japan,
up until the 11th, the day I left for home. However, they already knew
fully well that it was not possible for them to obtain asylum in Japan.
They even said that "we will probably have to go to some third nation,
which is the most important thing to the other. We have to be sure you
seamen left Japan immediately after Mr. YOUNG's persuasion, and consider that
they probably were smuggled out of Japan after the 10th, and before the
evening of the 13th, when
Beheiren announced their desertion at a press
conference. However, Mr. YOUNG says that the four seamen were in Japan up
to 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the

bore evening: of the 13th.)
The films showing the four seamen were shown publicly in the U.S.,

Professor: When the films were publicly shown, there was big excitement,

home, but so far, I have only been questioned once by the Navy's Intelligence
Section, about the circumstances. It seems that American authorities con-
cerned do not want to make too big a fuss over the matter.
What do the parents think of this action taken by their sons?
Professor: A certain television station asked the mother of one of
the
years, and the other of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the
