Nething came of the check and there is no reason to believe that Subject
will be troubled further. But the prospect of complications with the
French authorities, who are now a-daya frequently in an angry mood anyway,
which is not a matter of the fact that the question of the question is
with Tiantity as he had been. Also, net kinging what could have been be-
hind the palice check and not wishing to take unnecessary risks in the
circuestances, we did not daily with the reading thinge which needed to
be cdee. Identity was finished with Subject shortly before, non, whercupan
to the question. The question is that the question is that the question is
the latter because we had not received by post the negatives he clains to
have sent. he met Subject at the Gare Mantpurnanee at 1500 hours to
discover that he had not been able to get the negatives owing to the
reluctance of the photographts to part with them, or so that he was
not. The question is that he had not been able to get the Subject to the
vicinity of his hotel near the Gare St. Lenzid where we waited until we
saw Subject depart from the hotel after checking out with his things.
This we knew that he had departed safely and that he had not got involved
in a police follow up.
7. Arrangements with Subject: By the time we left Subject on 9
January we promised him that we would write him within five days to in-
ter the same time. The question is that we would write him within five days
general answer whether he will be transferred to Germany; i.e., what
he has been hired. DIR 07455 had not yet been received by us in Paris.
Before leaving Paris on 10 January we received DIR 07455 which requested
that no definite commitment to and to Subject and we accordingly left a
decision to be given to the question. The question is that we would
about 15 January. In double talk this letter will tell Subject that we
(the undersigned) have not received a definite answer, that we shall try
to get one for his sake, and that we expect to have one by about 1 February.
The question is that we would write him within five days to in-
ter the same time. The question is that we would write him within five
days. We trust that it will be possible and convenient to reach a decision con-
cerning Subject by about 1 February. In the course of the Paris meeting
we also informed Subject that we (the undersigned) would probably come to
fetch his, which tentative assurance was given in order that Subject would
not have reason to think that he would lose contact with someone he knows
that the question is that we would write this note. Subject was also told that he
could probably go to PEPHUS 11 and the Otherwise, no plans or tentative
arrangements were discussed with Subject.
8. Identity' Assessment of Subject: Case officer discussed Subject
at length with Identity and we believe it is safe and fair to state that
there is complete general agreement concerning Subject. We may disagree
that the question is that we would write this note. Subject to the question
to be a minor matter. Identity struck the parabatic that Subject "satisfies
all selection criteria" used in PART 4625 and will have concurred in this
dispatch. Identity would prefer not to write a prools of his assessment
at this time; he would rather submit his full assessment which will cover
the question. The question is that we would write this note. Subject
retura to Headquarters. There is little we on aid and trust that this
will suffice for the time being. In general we believe that our assess-
ment submitted as Attachment C to E2A-2403 is not wide of the mark.
We do not, however, with this to be construed as an indirect report on
Identity' assessment of Subject; he will submit his own report. In-
ternally, we have enjoyed working with Identity on this case and have
likely to know his techniques and approach. His trip has no far been most
salutary.
9. Concert concerning a decision on Subject: The decision on
Subject's candidature for SELROX cutg not be delayed any longer than in
necessary. Identity agreed that Subject will keep for a time and that he
very much status the job with us. There are several reasons why we think
that it could be unwise to delay the decision to remove Subject free
and not to distinguish since it can be held with that, unless difficulty. Piver,
he is Naturally important and will not be happy if he is obliged to work

REPORT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION
SUBJECT: AEAESPIC
Dates of Examination:
6; 9; 10 January 1959
Subject was met in Paris on the above dates by the case officer
and the examiner and was submitted to a preliminary psychological
examination via a French interpreter.
Subject was born 12 July 1918 in Georgia which; at this time,
the 1959 article was made in the The Subject classifies his parents as
Subject and is of the opinion that the parents are not influence
upon his behavior and development particularly in the general
followed the family's flight from Georgia to France in 1921. In other
words, the Subject abides by the prejudicial class attitude of Noblesse
Oblige and feels an obligation of honorable and generous behavior
attributable to his birth rank. He is also of the opinion that this concept
of nobility has evolved into a system of dignity and pride in his endeavors.
This concept is also extended to include the attitude: "If you pretend to be
something, you have to act accordingly."
The family fled Georgia before the Soviet invasion. The Subject
feels that he was too young to understand but recalls having revolted
against the flight because it was a humiliating defeat rather than a
tactical retreat. He operates by the attitude that one must fight,
surpass or conquer rather than to submit or accept defeat. He is,
according to his own self-concept, a person who can not tolerate being
referred to by the subject. He is not a member of the other
stronger than several million men. He presents the analogy that he
is like a man who wants to kill an elephant. All he needs provided for
him is a high powered rifle and then he would feel equal to the elephant.
The Subject admits of physical inferiority feelings by virtue of his size
and strength but he denies any feelings of intellectual inferiority and
admits that he depends more upon his mental faculties than upon his
physical abilities. Apparently the Subject has never been able to
accept what he considers the original defeat and flight from Georgia.
211-233477


In addition, his father later returned to Georgia because he wanted to
die in Georgia. Although the Subject can appreciate his father's point
of view he is unable to forgive his father for hating admitted his defeat
by returning to Georgia to die. Although the Subject does not regard
himself as a Georgian, and is certainly not regarded as a nationalist,
he is a competitive individual and may be motivated for affiliation in order
to compensate for having experienced what he regards as defeatat the
hands of the Soviets. To obtain a new idea that the world is the
concern of the human nature of the world. If there the car. the that when he was
committed to prison he was not bithered by the prison life but by
the fact that he had made a wrong calculation in assiciating himself with
an unsuitable partner and consequently was arrested and imprisoned.
For him, therefore, the first day in prison was wore than all the others.
According to the Subject, the sense of defeat together with the competitive
urge to balance the score is the primary factor in his personality and
life experience. In addition to these, as was mentioned above, he is
highly self-confident and optimistic that he will succeed despite the
hazards and odds. It would appear that these attitudes are important
as regards his motivation for affiliation, manager and utilization
of his services.
Because the father had provided himself with certain monies the
family was able to live comfortably and even opically upon its arrival
in France. However, the vicissitudes of life brought the family
progressively to financial difficulties and later to the degradation.
The first day, the American American Republic status had a
marked influence upon his way of thinking thereafter. Whereas the
family had previously lived in an artificial, feudalistic way it was
not brought into more direct contact with reality and, although this
was not necessarily a bad influence, life was tough. The Subject's
early loss of economic status is important as regards his selection
for affiliation because it also constituted a loss of social status which is
more primary in Subject's personality. A review of the Subject's life
history reveals that he has always responded to material incentives in
his various schemes and ventures. However, in terms of his personality,
material success is a short-cut method of attaining social status.
Consequently, it may be concluded that his drive for social status is
more basic than his need for financial status.
From an early age the Subject was non-disciplined and in the
school situation he constantly rebelled against the authority of those
teachers whom he felt did not regard him as intelligent or pay him
-2-


sufficient individual attention. Because he felt his teachers were too
distant they were automatically unpleasant and apparently his rebellious
Behavior was his way of obtaining attention and getting closer to the
teachers. He consistently refused to abide by the conformist attitude
of his peers and felt compelled to do those things not normally done by
others. He engaged in practical, and that he was generally regarded as
the most important factor. As a result of the "sufficient" of the
one school after another and accumulated a record of having attended 18
different schools. It is also of interest that he never obtained a degree
from the institutions of higher education with he attended.
This early- delinquent behavior in the school situation is of
interest to us because it reflects the Subject's motivational attitudes
which are present to date. As far as he is concerned, his scholastic
and socialism are not a major role in the social and social science of
of a goal to pursue and his hope that his ideals would crystallize and
materialize. The Subject is rather abstract in this interpretation.
It would seem that his ideal involves not only material but moral
comfort and security. However, he has always regarded society,
through his disappointment and mortifying experiences, as wicked and
selfish in its majority. Consequently, he expressed his dissatisfaction
in the form of aggressive and anti-social behavior typical of the malcontent.
One might ask why this individual reacted to his life experience
in this manner. He was apparently a precocious child who experienced
disillusionment both in his family and in his society. At first he felt
this disillusionment was unique and peculiar to himself, but he soon
discovered that his discontent was also shared by others. This
reinforced his combative attitude and he reflected this attitude in his
non-conforming behavior. It was as if he suddenly had discovered to
his great disappointment that there was no Santa Claus.
Another aspect of his system of ideals proceeds from his concept
of chivalry which he feels his parents inculcated. This is a sort of
Robin Hood concept by which the Subject visualizes himself as a hero
who rushes to the rescue of the weak and oppressed. This concept is
somewhat antastic and has misguided his behavior in various situations
throughout his life. For example, the school situation, he would typically
assume blame for the wrong-doings of others. Later in life he responded
to the plight of others for the conscious reason of wanting to help them.
The Subject feels that many people need help and that he has always wanted
-3-


to help others in order to help himself. In other words, he is
moulvated to help others in order to obtain love and affection. His
need for love and affection is probably one of his most basic needs
and this need is expressed in all of his interpresonal contacts.
The Subject's mother reacted to his neurotic behavior with
over affectionate solicitousness. Although she wasn't actually able
to determine the reasons for his internal distress. she was aware that
something was taking place within him and finally took him to a psychiatrist
because of his behavior problems. However, she didn't feel able to advise
him of what she was doing and took him to the psychiatrist on a subterfuge.
In addition, because the Subject disagreed with the psychiatrist's
conclusions, he did not benefit by this experience. This would indicate
that in handling the Subject it would be wise not to approach him
covertly or as if he were a problem but to permit him to maintain his
posture that he is right and that society is wrong. The mother was a
marked conformist who insisted that the Subject should abide by the
social order. To be successful, the Subject's handlers should avoid
trying to make him conform in his attitudes toward society by well-
meandized questions.
The Subject continually deceived and disappointed his mother
because each time she started him in a new school he made promises
that he would behave but each time he managed to be expelled because
of his behavior. The Subject is consciously convinced that his mother
acted in his good interest and not for her satisfaction of wanting a
perfect child. However, it is the opinion of this examiner, that the
mother's over-solicitousness was compensatory for her basic rejection
of the Subject. It is not likely that she did things for him but that she
did things to and with him for herself. In other words, she wanted the
Subject to be perfect so that he could be worthy of the mother.
Subject, he said, "We have to be able to know what we are. The Subject did not
also have been her attitude toward her husband. Consequently appears to
behave perfectly, did not merit her love and another person. However,
be continually seeking the love and affection of other persons. However,
he said, "We have to be able to know what we are, his mother and denies
that she acted in her own interest. One of his principal defenses is
denial - simply assuming the attitude that such and such is not true
when he probably believes it is true.
-4-


The Subject regards his mother as having been the aale of
the family. He also regards her as having been the major influence
in his life. He is particularly disappointed in his mother because he
feels, although he loved her she deserted him through suisere. He
feels she had sacrificed herself completely for her children and that
she killed herself because she no longer knew how to distribute love and
their love and their family. He said that he was a garden garden, garden
when he realized that his father was not providing a good for his father
affection. However, the Subject identifies with his father in the respect
that both have never achieved anything significant and consequently may
have disappointed his mother. The Subject misses his mother's love
and feels that his life was broken when she died: He found himself
completely alone and all his illusions apparently disappeared. He
has tried to obtain affection through others and realizes that his need
for affection is a big part of himself. On the other hand "Tarn a
complicated person, however, I am not difficult to understand.
The Subject reflects disappointment in his father as a personal
ideal. He regards his father as an independent person who was kind
but profoundly selfish, Nevertheless, the father would give the shirt
off his back. The father was fond of children, loved the whole family
and was happy when he saw others happy. However, the Subject is
disappointed in his father in that his father never succeeded. He feels
that if his father had succeeded none of the things that happened in his
life would have come to pass. He feels that his mother's suicide is a
direct consequence of his father's failure to succeed.
When the father returned to Georgia the Subject was driven to
dispair over the dissolution of the family. The Subject was the baby
of the family and the death of his mother and the departure of his
father and sister were a threat to his emotional security. He tried to
restrain his father by threatening him that because of a French law
that he was not going to pay taxes before leaving the country, the father
ran the risk of being the right to be able to be able to be able to be able to
she became angry and replied that the father was mature enough to act
as well as possible. The Subject's attempt to prevent his father from
leaving was conflictual for him because, although he didn't want his
father to leave, he also did not want to interfere with his father's desire.
This experience taught the Subject that when his father made a decision
he would carry it through at any cost. As it happened, the result was
the disintegration of the family. However, this incident is of interest
5.


to the Subject's handlers because he indicates that he will abide by
firm authoritative decisions even though he objects to them.
Whereas the Subject was attached to his mother; his sister was
identified with his father. The sister followed her father to Georgia
out of a spirit of affection and sacrifice because she felt that her father
was
said. The subject regards his sister as a truth that he was able to
needed her. The Subject regards his sister as a trait of the father, he
mistakes. The sister taught languages in school and at the time of Stalin
the children would say: "We have done this that we think to Stalin!"
She would reply: "You are not the most likely to have done this or that
without Stalin that he was arrested and sent to a concentration
campbell that the change of regimes she obtained her freedom and
the need to her job. It would appear that the sister is an individualist
like the Subject.
The sister's husband had emigrated to France at a much later
date and apparently could not adapt himself and regretted having left
Russia. He returned to Russia and the Subject believes that because
he had served in the German Army he was sent to a concentration camp
in Russia. Subject regards the intellectual level of his brother-in-law
as that of his sister. The brother-in-law also had an inferiority complex and
this may have been an additional reason why the Subject had rejected him
as a brother-in-law.
The Subject's brother, who is an architect in Gap, appears to
be an independent person who is conservative and more conforming than
the Subject. The Subject does not regard his brother as having distinguished
himself in extraordinary fashion. It is of interest that the Subject may be
jealous of his brother and states that his brother has been more successful
but in his own sphere and in terms of his own standards. It is of interest
also that the Subject's philosophy is not to accept the fact that he has been
unsuccessful but to try to explain his lack of success by the process of
introspection and self-analysis. This emphasis and orientation as regards
obtaining a greater knowledge of himself is typically a neurotic and
represents his need to love himself and to rationalize his failures.
The Subject feels that his brother is jealous of him whereas it is likely
that both are jealous of each other. It is also likely that the Subject
and his brother were rivals for the mother's affection. For example
the Subject feels both he and his brother loved the same type of women.
-6-


The Subject was more expressive of his affection toward his mother
whereas his brother was more timid, shy and independent. When the
brother saw the Subject getting his mother's attention he tried to replace
the Subject. When the brother learned that the Subject was seeing a girl
whom he knew, too he advised the girl to leave the Subject alone. This
sibling rivalry may continue to date: However, the fraternal relationship
is likely to be more complex. It may be that the brother regards the
Subject' as "Pack's-Bad Boy" or the black sheep of the family and is
interested in fostering the Subject as regards opportunities for
accomplishment or success. For some reason, the subject's partner
has been the subject of the subject. The subject tends to either instrumental
in the "spotting of the Subject. The Subject tends to siter away from a
discussion of his brother and chiefly presents the data that this brother
is kind, somewhat vain and that he is fond of his brother. By a
comparative analysis of the Subject and his relationship to his brother
it is apparent that the Subject has a very strong desire to succeed
and toaccomplish He was also influenced by others in this regard.
For example, at a certain time in his childhood the Subject lived hear
some former Georgia resistance who had fought against the Sovieta
The Subject regarded these persons's uncedicated but admirable and
affectionate; lifeless that the spectaritally may have been the subject
to the subject. The subject is a "good feeling feels he must
have been impressed by their patriotism. The Subject is a sentimental
person and he was exalted and deeply impressed by the warm and
enthraling manner in which they expressed themselves. He feels that
this particular association may have contributed to his passion which
he always puts into the execution of whatever he undertakes.
The Subject claims that he has learned from his personal
experiences in life rather than from school or from the experiences
of others. He feels that he has educated himself in the school of life
and has derived little from formal education or from the experiences
of others. For example, he claims that his mother's opinion had
importance for him only at the time she rendered her opinions. As
far'as he was concerned they did not have a lasting influence. This
item is important as far as the Subject's reaction to future training is
concerned. It is likely that he would be impatient to proceed with the
task in actuality rather than to learn about performing a task through
the experiences of others.
-7-


The Subject feels that throughout his school experience, perhaps
only one or two teachers really understood him. He regarded the others
as apparently idiotic or worthless. These particular teachers taught
him that it was often necessary in life "to swallow a great deal of useless
"stuff" so that thereafter, certain essentials could be more easily
digested. This is another helpful hint as regards the trainers who
may be assigned to the Subject.
Subject feels that, apart from his academic progress at school,
he learned that it was necessary to communicate, to express himself,
to understand and explain. He feels that these are necessary skills in
society and he relies quite heavily upon his verbal intelligence. It is
likely that he would relate well with a person who exhibited superior
Wadom and expressive ability. It is also likely that he would relate
poorly to an inarticulate person of lower intelligence.

that the Subject was. disillusioned in these men and his ideals were
shaken when he later learned to his dismay that they could commit
abject or monstrous acts. Related to these experiences, is the fact
that the Subject puts no stock in emblems or signs of rank or reputation.
He regards such signs as identifying labels only and is not impressed.
The fact that he tends to be a skeptic or a cynic should be important
to his handlers.
As a foreigner is France the Subject was liable to mobilization
into the French Army at the beginning of World War II. However, he
felt the authorities took an awful long. time to make a decision in connection
with him and because of this he joined the French Foreign Legion and
left immediately for North Africa feeling that at last he was becoming
a member of a famous unit and at the same time fulfilling his obligations
towards the French military service. This is an example of his impulsivity,
sentimentalism and need for prestige. However, it was not long before
he became dissatisfied and expressed his discontent in opinions that
-8-


France was an incoherent mess. He bitterly regretted that he had
become acquainted with people who obviously did not know what they
wanted. The Subject feels that his experience in the Foreign Legion
did not have any preat-difluence on his character except that it
mobilized a profound dislike for irresolute persons. This point
was dealt with before. However, it is worthwhile to repeat that the
Subject is an impatient fellow. who desires immediate action as regards
his interests. He is impatient-with postponement and with what he
regards as a alack of resolve on the part of others. Unless he is dealt
with promptly he develops critical opinions and complaints. As regards
his affiliation, it is important to note that he has no real alternative at
this time and is therefore required to accept no more than one.
The subject has been given to the most important waste of time he will
accept them because he lacks control at this-point in his processing.
The Subject married for the principal reason of creating a family
and a homs. Even though he understands the values of the principles
involved, principles which were inculcated by his father, the now feels
that it was a ridiculous mistake to marry just for the's of principles
without the necessary sentiments. He rationalizes that, at that time,
he was merely abiding by the precepts of his father without thinking of
the same way. He has been given to the most important values of the
a family did not represent anything at all except "aggravating the
incoherence and the division of society". In other words, for the
Subject, marriage meant building a wall around himself. He also
found that, instead. of finding a partner who complemented him, all he
obtained from the partnership was a reflection of himself. (In selecting
a partner for this Subject it would be wise to consider this aspect.)
The Subject feels that so-called spiritual intimacy is a fallacy. He
is of the opinion that women are necessary for equal purposes but he
falls to understand why it is necessary to "build a separate world"
with them. I would appear. In terms of the Subject's anti-social
attitudes, that he had hoped to create his own world through marriage,
but found that this was an illusion. He does not assume the responsibilities
for this attempt.
The Subject does not regard his marriage as a complete fiasco.
He feels that both he and his wife were fairly nice and that they got along
fairly well with one another but did not live very comfortably. Furthermore,
he did not feel that there was any evolution in the marriage. He admits to
his debit that he married because he wanted to experience what it meant
-9-


to have children. Actually, however, he did not want children as
individuals in themselves but he assumed that the marriage would
produce a child whom he exactly imagined and which would be a
reproduction of himself. However, the first child turned out to be a
female and this may have the Subject. The Subject voluntarily
submits that he had to be the difference between the male and the
age of the child seem to be a peculiar statement but, it has a good
deal of meaning for him, particularly as regards his relationship with
his mother, sister, wife and first child. He regards women as logical
and,as being determined by a psycho-feminine education, He developed
this attitude originally as'a defense against his mother's conforming
tendencies and it is probable that he crystallized the attitude when his
wife rejected him after he had attacked the bank and was arrested,
His wife had a second child while the Subject was in jail and the Subject
knows nothing about either of his children.
(This is enough to tip us off that the Subject should not be
exposed to females who would be important in his handling.)
During World War II the Subject became involved in black
marketing and in the false documents business and claimed to have
created a gang which he died and to have traveled throughout Central
Europe. He said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said,
he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said,
He said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said,
Europe. He said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said,
he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said,
black market business was a worthless branch, the only purpose of
which was to solve financial problems. However, he admits, that it
is true that the black market business reached such a magnitude that
a person that was interested only in making money could have found it
a quite satisfying and sufficient activity in itself.
As was mentioned above the primary purpose of the gang, according
to the Subject was to liberate prisoners. He was successful in releasing
13 French prisoners from Germany. He claims not to have done this for
partiotic motives before humanitarian reasons. He helped the prisoners
because they needed help and because he felt it was the right thing to do.
He was paid for this but claims to have given his money to help the
prisoners. He helped the French prisoners despite the fact that he
had sympathy for the Germans. He claims that his sympathy for the
Germans was based on the fact that some Georgians had relatives in
Germany and he hoped that the Germans would defeat the Russians. If
the prisoners had been Germans he would have done the same thing.
-10-


2
Even though he admired and sympatized with the Germans he claims
he would not have harmed France. All this is rather complex. However,
it is possible to understand his motivations according to his basic principle,
which involves a vague desire to help others who need it. He also
expresses pride in doing the outstanding and the difficult. The materiil
reward is not an ultimate end in itself. His emotionalized ideals are
not expressed clearly in terms of politics or nationality. This comples
of motivations will also be discussed in terms of the Subject's participation
in the bank robbery.
Although the Subject was satisfied, on the whole, with the
technical efficiency of his gang and although he was pleased with the
freedom of movement and his apparent security, he was arrested because
of
herelessness or a slip, not in the actual functioning of the gang; but
rather on the part of one of the men whom the gang was helping.
Consequently the Subject was arrested by the Gestapo. Because he
was considered by the Germans to be a very important prey he played
along and led the Germans to believe that he was more concerned.
They had figured: He hoped that such a tactic and a new one in their part
would bring him certain that he was not a very qualified that he could
have been shot for only half-what he had done and that it may have been
disadvantages and even him to exaggerate his part he claims to have done
and therefore to mix the tracks, to confuse the German authorities and to
avoid "fingering" certain partners whom he made appear as negligible
in the scheme. He played this game as long as he could but is end
gradually drew near. However, he is an imaginative fellow and he
hit upon the idea of claiming that he had invented a very interesting motor
that would run without gas.
He said, "I think that he thinks that this point in the war and consequently
took his offer into consideration and postponed his execution. As a result
he bought time and shortly thereafter was liberated by the Americans.
Through this experience the Subject has learned that it is very important
to know the weaknesses of authorities and to play these weaknesses against
one another. His emotions correspond to a joy of being the sole master
of the situation. He feels that if he were to find himself in this sort of
a situation again that he would act in exactly the same way. The
behavior is typical of that of a con man. He has the capacity to control
a situation in his own interest and to imaginatively talk himself out of
rather tight intinations. This is an outstanding characteristic
of his personality and consequently should be noted by his handers.
-11-


However, it would appear to the examiner that there is more to this
story than meets the eye. One would suspect that, since he obtained
mild treatment at the hands of the Gestapo. he probably collaborated
more than he is willing to admit at this time: It may be that he did
not fool the Gestapo at all. It is quite possible that the Gestapo used
him to pass on the authenticity of documents of other prisoners or. in
some other nefarious activity; If this can be established as true by
other techniques then we are dealing with a person who places self-
preservation above all else.
The Subject also has a history of criminal activity in France
after the war. At that time he was married and was the father of one
child. He was working at a model-maker's shop and although he was
not well off he was earning a decent living. According to the Subject
a close young friend solicited his assistance in attacking a bank in order
to be given the same time. He was a very good friend to be self-elf that the
other fellow was crazy to dare to attack a bank.
have had a stowing of conscience and asked himself the question. "He
it right to do harm by, robbing a bank?" Furthermore, he never felt
that a team of two partners would be able to attack a bank successfully
Apparently the other fellow was a fairly good recruiter. He reminded
the Subject of his war activities and he was of the opinion that since
the Subject had been able to accomplish certain illegal activities in
the past that he would be quite capable of attacking a bank. He also
displayed a confide nce in the Subject's capability to invent a plan of
the subject. He was a very good reminder of the subject. He was carefully
At each point in the developments the Subject tried to withdraw by
saying: "If my mother learned of this, she would die: He postponed
the job indefinitely. However, in the meantime his mother died and his
friend felt that he no longer had an excuse. The Subject compromised
by agreeing to knock over a jewelry store; Apparently they knocked over
two jewelry stores for the sake of good measure. However, after having
spent his money, the friend again returned with a proposition to attack
the bank. The Subject told him: "You got your money for your marriage;
now leave the alone. " However, the friend had not married his intended,
was broke, and was interested in financing another marriage. They
agreed that this would be the last job. Afterwards, however, the other
fellow apparently threw his money around and was arrested and squealed.
-12-

The Subject claims that after he casually learned of his friend's arrest.
he fled to the Spanish border. He had not foreseen or had prepared
himself for such a consequence and he implies a conflict as regards
leaving France. In any event, he was captured and imprisoned. The
question arises in this examiner's mind as to why the Subject either
panicked or was awkward in his flight, if he did have a chance to flee.
It may have been that he unconsciously wished to be caught. and to be
punished in order to relieve his guilt. He was ambivalent about
attacking the bank. If this is true, then important consideration
should be given to the Subject's personality as regards plans for the
eventuality of his being captured in the course of the project.
Subject feels that he failed badly when he was arrested both
by the Germans and by the French. He feels that these two incidents were
a consequence of poor selection of friends and poor planning. If he were
to find himself in the same type of situation again the would take all the
necessary precautions in order to avoid the same pitfalls. When he was
jailed by the French Police he was some what depressed by the facts that
he had failed in his planning and also that he had greatly disappointed his
relatives who looked down upon him as annoy and staff follow the
safety. He was a very good thing. He was a very good thing
quite a blow to his ego. However, his ego didn't collapse. There have
been times in his life when he felt the entire world seemd to conspire against
him and when everything seemed destroyed. He has always felt that there
are ways to get out of a mess, principally by exerting his ego. He
continues to believe that, unless a man is so weak, both physically and
morally, it is always possible for him to get back on his feet or at
least to hope that this is possible. Consequently, the Subject continues
to believe that there is always a possibility to fight and to conquer.
This optimism may be motivational in his present desire to affiliate
with us.
In the two projects which involved liberating French prisoners
and attacking the bank, Subject claim that he was betrayed by another
However, he felt his betrayal was important and consequently was not
angry at these persons. Because he feels that there are certain moral
values which he holds dearly, namely friendship, these persons lost
his esteem but he was more in contempt of himself for having miscalculated.
Although his mistakes have seriously reduced his circumstances of life,
regardless of their size and consequences, he does not feel that they have
discouraged him about future possibilities. "If there is a future, there is
hope! The Subject feels that he has never completely lost self-control
-13-


and that he has always been a master of his actions at all times and
that these actions could have been changed by his own vllution. This attitude
reveals his tremendous narcissistic investment in his own powers. As
far as this project is concerned, it would be unwise to rely upon the
Subject's judgements and it would be more prudent to plan every detail
for him and require him to abide by directions. He is an imaginative
executor but he is a very poor planner according to the testimony of
his record. His actions are often impulsive and unreasoned, Such
irrational behavior may take place in the context of a relationship
with another person despite the fact that the Subject may actually have
no particular responsibility b the other person except a tie of affection.
The Subject is unable to explain this peculiar aspect of his personality
and the subject. The subject is not a subject of his personality
or sufficient. Conseguently, this examineer concludes, that his impulsivity
and tendency to behave irrationally, and to his own disadvantage amounts
to an unconscious determinant of his behavior and is not available
toatational analysis. His propulsion by an uncontrollable internal
force is an important point of consideration as regards his utilization
by this project.
In summary, the Subject's chief motivations for illegal activity
appear to be the following:
a. The Subject will apparently do anything for a friend or
for a person in need.
b. Subject's relish of novelty, excitement, derring-do and
action. He is a Jesse James type.
c. Emotional outlet as regards the Subject's desires to
invent and to realize a success of an invention. The Subject
is an inventor by virtue of his temperament and mentality
and indulgea himself in problem-solving behavior and apparently
obtains a compulsive satisfaction if his ideas work out. In
other words heis'activated to carry out an action because of his
displaced interest in successfully engineering and accomplishing
a challenging task.
-14-


4. Material reward: As was mentioned before, material
Treward appears to be a means to social status. In the case
of the "bank robbery the friend obtained three-fourths of the
take and the Subject was content not to spend his money
freely in order not to arouse his wife's suspicions.
e. Competition with authority. Apparently the Subject
regarded the Paris bank as a symbol of authority and was
motivated to complete with what this symbol represented.
It may be the subject not actually wish to defeat the authority
but that he wanted to obtain the attention of authority as he
would be school situation. He certainly accomplished this,
The authorities are still paying attention to him. In fact they
treat-him as a "headstrong little boy", and are continually
interested in what he has on his mind. Their interest, of
course is not therapeutic but one of prevention.
1. Unrealistic optimum together with an exaggeration of
his own powers. also motivate the Subject to engage in
such activities. "Unionsciously he may feel like David who
was able to get a great. Coliath by virtue of possessing asking "shot.
The subject see him standing on a counter of a bank with
drawn pistols and with the clientele being immobilized in a
state of fear and surprise. The situation is so fantastic
that it is corny. However, it is meaningful for the Subject
and may partially explain his interest in writing detective
novels. If one would read his novel he would obtain a very
good picture of the Subject.
8. The bank robbery may have represented the Subject's
expression of his feelings of freedom upon release from
his mother through her death. She had always attempted
to try to make him conform. His wife is apparently the
same type of person as his mother and she proved it by
rejecting him when she learned about his antisocial
behavior.
h. The Robin Hood concept, which was mentioned before may
intigate the Subject to take from those in power and provide
for those in need.

There is an indeterminacy in the examiner's mind as to whether
the Subject is a leader or a follower. He claims to have been a leader
of the gang during World War II but in a careful analysis his relationship
with his bank partner it would appear that the other person was the leader.
The Subject; in this instance, was more of an "idea man" and executor
whereas the other chap was the instigator. There is no question that the
Subject regards himself as a leader. However an inspection of the record
indicates that he is a poor leader because he is impulsive, rash and tends
to
sill. Furthermore, he is like the cat in the Walt Disney film who,
while chasing the mouse and having his entire attention directed to
catching and incorporating the mouse, inadvertently gets himself
run over by a truck. His first one of the most important three truck
and
the
caring
regards not having arrived at the goal, i.e.,
catching the mouse. Despite this defeat he is able to pick himself up
again, figure things out and continue his pursuits. However, he does
not learn by experience and he repeatedly is defeated because he keeps
his eye too much upon the goal and non-tenough upon the hazards involved
in reaching the goal in addition to his lack of attention to necessary
details the Subject is also as was stated above, emotionally "stupid",
impulsive, rash; immature, inexperienced, and self-affected, separately, through
his life.
In regards to the above, another including of this man, life is
relevant. His left index functions and thumb tip are missing.
to have lost these in an exploration which occurred in Germany when he
was involved in the repatriation deal. According to him, after the
first one, he was asked up among the ruins an unexploded bomb
of British origin and took it home to salvage the explosive which he
might have used in various ways. While he was removing the detonator
which was probably stuck in its receptacle, it exploded in his hands.
The explosion occurred so quickly that there was no immediate pain
but those around him became panicky. He remained cold-blooded and
gave the order to remove all things which were there because the
explosion undoubtedly alerted the police When the police came they
explained that he had played with a fountain pen which had burst. They
took cognizance of his decorations and advised him never to pick up
objecto dropped by the enemy. The Red Cross cared for his wound.
The Subject does not regret the fact that he tried to dismantle the
bom! because he feels he had definitely learned that one should keep
-16-


140000
his hands away from certain things. This bomb incident may be indicative
of the things which were discussed in the preceding parag.aps. These
may be more to the bomb incident than the Subject offers but this could
not be established by the clinici! method.
Subject feels that a critic would say of him that the majority of
his undertakings have brought results which were considerably less
than hoped for. Consequently, he feels that a critic would regard him
either an optimist or a joker or else that his views on the possibilities
of accomplishing are not very sound.
In his own defense the Subject feels that he has made many
mistakes in his life but however big these mistakes were, he does
not feel that they have basically influenced his character. He feels
that his character basically involves the desire to become a worth-
while individual even at the cost of behaving wrongly. He feels that if
the only criteria for judging a man are his achievements, that he may

He feels that he is not being used properly and that there is a power
within himself, a creative urge for movement and realization which
is highly emotionally charged and which permits him to feel that he
is cäpable of doing much more than he has in the past, However, this
energy will have to be rationally harnessed if it is to be productive.
Another aspect in regard to the above is that one of the Subject's
chief motives is curiosity. He contiendly weeks the unknown. However,
when he approaches the unknown he experiences emotional insecurity and
is ambivalent about proceeding or withdrawing. This may have been a
factor which influenced the successful escape through the Pyrenees.
The Subject has a fear about which he doesn't know or understand and
is afraid of getting myself into something which he cannot get himself
to be. He has a taste action is to withdraw without solving the problem.
Consequently, it would appear that the Subject needs the direction of
superior intelligence in order to help him evaluate the realities of a
situation or predicament. He needs firm support, guidance.
direction as regards the on- dissidration of all possible realities
and alternatives As was said before, he says, kept in mind that this
urge for self-preservation is concerned, than his desire to solve problems
of to carry through ong. On the other hand, the Subject claims
that he always tries to be a hardest to keep his promises. Thus, if he
has a good sense, he will attempt to carry it through despite
the dangers involved. He may be rash in this regard but feels his
rashiness is due to the fact that he thinks quickly and is able to rapidly
apprehend and synthesize the components. and essence of a problem
in its various perspectives. In other words, he is alert and quick
and gets the point immediately even before you finish your sentence.
However, it would be wise not to interpret his intellectual alisicry as
a commitment or as an index that he will complete a task. It means
merely that he gets your point it doesn't mean that he will cooperate,
especially when the going is.
Another factor is interest to the project is that this person is
not likely to change. regards his basic characteristics. He has
marked difficulties, projecting himself in terms of what he would like
to be.
He has a very. this opinion that in order to change himself, it would be
however, he feels that every thing is relative and perhaps he should
show more strength of character, be little more compromising,
more realistic and less sentimental. However, according to him,
this would imply that the environment would be such that there was
no room for sentiment. In this case, his personality would be
-18-


definitely out of place. Consequently, the Subject does not think he will
be a very different person in the future from what he is now. However,
he hopes that his material situation will have improved not necessarily
financially, but socially. He also naively hopes that the world will
change and that there will be no discrimination and that there will
be a general improvement of living conditions for everyone. He is a
humanitarian in his outlook but he is not an activistio social reformer,
except in the sense that he is an individualistic rebel. Generally he
strives to improve his own standard of living and he feels that his
own inclination to better things is the disease of all inventors. The
Subject also hopes to acquire, if necessary, a nationality by virtue of
which he could feel that he actually belongs to a society. However
that he is a very useful way of working on his own, they as being anxious
to stamp and label individuals and he would prefer to be a person
outside of society than to be a member of society if he is required to
conform. As was said before his handlers would be wise not to label,
to type or to try in any way to get the Subject to conform to society.
He will run tings around them like he did his mother. As regards his
future outlook, the Subject is not entirely optimistic. He feels that he
will never beable to reach his ideals because his material ideal (social
reform); is a distant and so difficult that he would need to lead many
lives in order to attain it. It might be unfair to designate him as a
pessimist. As was said before, he is more of a skeptic and perhaps
the people. Consequently, one should be careful as regards inculcating
ideologic and neurotomyolines. One should be content to accept his
motives in their present state. Tampering with them would only result
in disturbing the Subject.
The Subject denies that he has any emotional interest in or
emotional attachment to France at this time. Although it was likely
that he was sentimentally patriotic before the war it is a fact that he
has been branded as a criminal and has been deprived of certain civil
rights and privileges He now perhaps feels rejected and in turn
is rejecting France. Nevertheless he strikes the examiner as a
Frenchman in terms of the way he thinks, feels and acts. He is
certainly not a Russian in his personality. He expresses himself
freely, is discursive, voluble, and is able to carry on a conversation
intensely and indefinitely on his topics of interest. This is typically
French, but, in terms of his personality, it represents an oral
characteristic. In other words he is inclined to express himself
orally and is motivated. 10 obtain love and affection together with
other supplies by oral incorporation. What this means to you is that
-19-


he is "mouthy" and he will eat you up if you are not careful or if you
get too close, Incorporation is the epitomy of control. Consequently,
if you allow him to incorporate you he's got control, not you: Be wary,
and detached in this regard. He has already eaten up the case officer.
The Subject is currently involved in his avocation of inventions
and is the owner and exploiter of several patents. He has engaged the
financial and technical interests of several others in his inventions.
He currently presents the problem of being divided between the
invention-business and continuing in the preliminary phases with us.
He claims that if he were to join us he would have to relinquish every-
thing to his business partners. This is probably true, and it is also
probably true that he would relinquish his invention interest but at the
same time. He has been taken in the fashion of a con man. It would
be wise to ignore this gambit.
Additional description of the personality includes the fact that
he reflects a superior intelligence is capable of abstract conceptualizations
and is easily able to deal in symbols. He would have no difficulty as
regards the intellectual aspects of training; However, in his training,
other things will have to be kept in mind. He has an article

to love himself. In other words, he is quite in love with himself
and thereby acts accordingly. He also tends to rationalize and to
offer socially acceptable reasons for his individualistic behavior
and for his past failures. He acts because he thinks he is right
and because he will succeed. He is quite egotistical in this regard.
He strives chiefly for emotional satisfaction. It would be wise to
remember also that he appears to be- altruistic-but at the same time
to
be

but will hope to get something out of it for himself. The altruistic and
selfish drives-merge and he is motivated by both at the same time.
He needs to prove to others that he is capable of success and he is
self-confident in his power but is insecure. that others may not regard
him as adequate. Basically he is an exhibitionist, but is too sophisticated
to brag or to display himself in a transparent manner. However, he
needs attention and is likely to do things in order to get attention. This
is what he has done in the past. He particularly strives not to be regarded
as bad = evil. He wants to be regarded as a person who has differences of
-20-


opinions and conflicts with the social order. It would be fair to say that
he is not a true criminal but is more of a neurotic character who
expresses his conflicts and difficulties by non-conforming behavior. He
is a stubborn fellow who does not like to be defeated and strives to
conquer. Despite his tendencies to magical thinking he strives to be
rational and realistic, but his strong emotional pressures get in his
way. He experiences melancholy and depressive mood swings but
maintains a light side and attempts to relieve his dysphoric feelings
with lightness and humor. He relies heavily on the technique of
humor to relieve tension and to avoid the demobilization of anxiety
in interpersonal relationship. His humor may be regarded as a
good index of his anxiety.
In light of the above the Subject's motivation for affiliation at
this time is rather complex. However, on the surface it is positive,
spontaneous voluntary and tense. He is really on the shelf in Gap,
is isolated lonely, controlled in his movements restricted in his
aspirations and unable to realize freedom and to develop himself as an
individual Consequently, the assignment represents a unique opportunity
to escape from his present level of existence and it is no wonder that he
is pushing for a quick release from Gap. However, if he were released
without the sufficient setability of the system, he is not a
selection techniques he has proved to be a difficult handling problem in
the future and is demanded that his processing be slowed down to
the future and that security and other operational requirements be satisfied
prior to lifting him out of Gap. Once he is taken out of Gap he, like the
con man, is on first base, and, no matter how you slice it, he will have
established himself in a bargaining position.
The Subject likes Americans for sentimental reacns. Although
he realizes that the United States may have selfish political interests
he is willing to go along out of admiration for the sincerity of the
Americans. He likes the liberty which exists in America and the
fact that people are treated like individuals rather than, as numbers.
General by his attitude toward the Americans is typically emotional
and is understandable in terms of what has been said about his
personality.
Although the Subject is a rank individualist and a non-conformist
he realizea that he must cope with the community and must sacrifice
for the good of the community. In particular, he would not like to harm
-21-


140000
others. In this regaid it is unlikely that the Subject has even
committed physical assault nor is it likely that he would in the
future. No matter what the other person would represent to the
Subject he would still be regarded as a human being whom the
Subject would respect and would not harm. The Subject is not
necessarily a hostile person. He will act out of exigency but will
deliberately avoid being sadistic or nontonly cruel. This is of
importance, as far as the project is concerned. If the Subject were to
find himself in a tight spot which requi red killing another person it
is a moglikely that he would do so. It is more likely that he would attempt
to resolve the situation by verbal machin ations.
The Subject prefers to work alone as regards technical research
but as regards the execution of an operation, he prefers to be part of
an organization. He knows he can rely-upon himself when he is alone
to be otherwise befunufiable in the past. However, if it is
necessary to be the only otherwise he will accept it. It must be
kept in mind; however, that he is not a believer. I work alone. The
Subject is likely to be loyal to a person who is not a superior
and in the relationship he may even be critical of himself. I order
to express his loyalty he would like to prove his usefulness.
superior but, at the same time, he would feel inadequate in that he
would require the protection of a superior. In his initial contacts with
a partner, the Subject would attempt to assume leadership on the team
but if the partner were superior by virtue of intelligence and/or experience,
i.e. the subject is not a member. It is likely that he would be a better
follower of an adequate leader. He is not a member of the other
The reason for this is that he is more of a dependent than an independent
person in terms of his interpersonal relationships. Furthermore, he is
inclined to act on impulse and sentiment and consequently his judgement
is questionable. In terms of ideal pairing, the Subject would work better
with a more sober-minded, calculating and mature individual whom he
would respect and with whom he would enjoy an informal but authoritative
Relationship.
Prior to the last session of the preliminary examination on the
10th of January 1959 the Subject was routinely contacted by the French
Police who were investigating his reasons for being in Paris at that time.
As a result of this contact, the Subject was markedly apprehensive and
preoccupied and was not able to freely devote himself to the psychological
analysis as theretofore. The Subject's primary motive is, of course,
self-preservation and since he is an extremely alert and vigilant
individual he is likely to over-react and to become emotionally upset
-22-


with such a provocation. Because of this it appears that the Subject
needs the guiding influence of a more mature experienced person who
is in more control of the situation. An additional point of interest is
that the Subject is capable of using such an experience as the visit by
the police as a device to control. For example, because of the visit
by the police, the Subject. aborted the psychological analysis. He did
the same thing, in another way, on the preceding contact with the
case officer. It is as if the Subject does not want as a person who
and to learn: too much about him. Therefore, the first of this behavior is
that the Subject. and is, another consciously or unconsciously fesis
that the Subject. and is, acceptable to our service. In other words, he
may act according to the opinion that a decision has been made in his
favor and consequently he sees no need for enduring a psychological
analysis. It is likely that he would have the same attitude toward a
security interrogation and as regards training.
As regards the general selection criteria for the project is
would appear that the Subject satisfies the requirements of the
resourcefulness, mechanical/talempleis explain the infiltration-exfiltration
of the subject. and the subject is a detail. "In the invitation, etc. However,
there are other factors which may or may not vitiate the positive features.
These factors are pertinent to areas such as security and handling. It is
recommended that before the Subject is removed from Gap that he be
administered a security examination in a controlled situation. Such
an examination should be conducted by a skilled and experienced
individual who is fluent, in French, who is unbiased and objective and
who is not overly rigid. as regards his conventional standards. With
such an examiner, there is a fifty-fifty chance that the Subject would
satisfy security standards. The other problem area which remains is
that of handling, and unless, this is thought out carefully and appropriate
personnel assigned, the hand will be quicker than the eye.

DRAFT
II December 1958
MEMORANDUM FOR: THE RECORD
SUBJECT
:
David TZITZICHVILI - Red Sox Candidate
1. Thisis an- indirect assessment of the above named individual
based on a W-B test administered by a case officer in the field and on
a PROI. Subject apparently is being considered for a two-man mission
of relatively short duration. The main questions about him seem to be:
Cra he learn to do what will be required? What would be his motivation?
With what sort of person would be get on-best in a two-man team? What
special problems can be anticipated and avoided in his handling?
A brief telephone report was supplied to the headquarters
case officer on 10 December 1958. It was stated that Subject possesses
adequate intelligence, unusual social skills, and a propensity for getting
what he wants without conscience. He is impulsive and surprisingly
irrational in satiefying his personal desires. He will appear at first
to have leadership skill and interest -- hence will probably just take
over leadership of the team. In the long run, however, most persons
who would be team-mates would become disenchanted and either reject
him or take over themselves. Because of this man's social versatility,
impulsiveness and freedom from conscience, he would be particularly
difficult to control. That is, it would be difficult to ascertain that he

- 2 -
actually did what he claimed to have done. His case officer would have
to be especially alert for double-dealing, careful to build in checks and
counterbalances, and tough and firm in handling style. Despite the
limitations noted it was felt that this mae is worth the risks involved.
3. In comparison with agent candidates of the sative nationality
which we have assessed, Subject's intelligence is above average. No
intellectual; he is nevertheless unusually well informed and unusually
observant of what is going on around him He is likely to be quite
pedantic, but his thinking is not rigorous. He makes decisions im-
pulsively and on analogy. He is therefore likely to make
reasonable and better organised than he is in fact, and one is less likely
to be prepared for his impulsive acts of bad judgment. To summarize
the intellectual factor, he is intelligent, but he looks brighter, better
educated and more capable of good judgment than he is in fact. How-
ever, these are not intellectual limitations to his usefulness in the type
of mission considered.
4. Perhaps this man's strongest skill-is his versatility in
playing social roles. If he so wants, be can make himself appear
acceptable to a wide variety of people. He is accustomed to getting out
of tight spots by exercising charm or "personality." At the same time.
however, he can be very temperamental when his desires are frustrated
G


- 3
and when he feels he-is crossed. He needs a lot of sensual experience
and his sensuality and desire for emotional experience is not too well
controlled. He especially likes new and novel experiences, which he
will go after with little attention to the probable consequences.
5. This man is quite dependent on social activity and social
relationships for amusement; support,and incentive. He may at times
try to play the role of the independent, self-sufficient, lone-wolf, but
he could not sustain such a role for long. He must participate with
people in a relatively emotional way. At the same time he is likely
to be exceptionally suspicious of all the people he work with. He is
not very realistic in his suspiciousness, and he is inclined to exaggerate
clues and signs. With reference to the proposed mission, he is likely
to express distrust of anyone who is introduced as a partner. Like-
wise it may be assumed he will try to take over the role of leader
even though he has no particular leadership skills. This will present
problems, because in our opinion over the long haul he would make a
poor leader, for the following reasons: (a) he is not accustomed to
playing any role consistently for a long period of time, (b) he is more
depeadent socially than be likes to admit, (c) his judgement is not con-
sistent; he operates too much on impulse or sentiment and beace when
the chips are down he cannot backstop his decisions with reasoned
judgement.

6. It is our opinion that this man is unusually unescumbered
by conscience. When he-wanté something, he takes it. When it
requires him to cross a friend, he does so without guilt. If he looks
ahead at consequences he does so in terms of "getting caught and
being punished" rather than losing moral stature. He certainly feels
little genuine loyalty to codes, institutions, or causes other than his
own. He is more likely to remain loyal to a specific individual whom
he respects or fears. The principal implications of these characteristics
are: (a) be is not regarded as a promising candidate for polygraph testing
the record is more likely to be misleading than is most cases (b)he
will require a particularly firm straight forward, alert officer
whom Subject either respects or fears. A warm, friendly relationship
here would likely result in Subject becoming exceedingly suspicious of
his case officer, in efforts to manipulate the case officer, and disruption
of relations owing to. temperamental outbursts.
7. The best single characterisation we can make of his
motivation for the assignment is that if his personal desires happen to
be congruent with the purposes of the mission; then his motivation is
appropriate. His interests might include desire for an exciting clandestine
experience and for social prestige, as well as for money. They certainly
do not include any abstract political or ideological motives. The important
SECRET


- 5 -
thing is that this man is unusually intent on satiefying his own whims
and câprices whenever they are set-off, which makes him more incon-
sistent than one expects and hence more difficult to control.
8. Conclusion: Even more than the normal run of agent candi-
dates this man is solely out for himself. Coupled with this characteristic
is his social skill and his ability to get away with gratifying his own desires
irrespective of the feelings or interests of others. This indicates
peculiarly difficult control problems, which in our opinion require an
unusually competent; alert, siric., even. authoritarian case officer.
Despite the number of negative characteristics discussed in this report,
it is nevertheless our opinion that this man is still worth considering
providing he has the minimum requirements of language, access to target,
and cover. He has the requisite intelligence and very useful social skills.
He can get away with activities which would be disturbing or upsetting to
other people, and this would appear to be a major qualification.

Iveena and which Nero picked up and we deported for Parlas. Farding
the trip we had an opportunity to coverzo with Subject about his early
life, feaily problesm, etc. As it turned out the legg drive gave us
an ideal opportunity to draw out Subject aboit himcolf and his present
contributions. we arrived in Paris on 16 October at 0700 hours.
Subject 133 depped with the house of Inciently A. Arrangcants were
made. to Best his a 1600 hours in the vicinity of the Dare Entaparissae,
and the 1600 hours of the 1600 hours. The 1600 hours of the 1600
obtained. Atter the four hour meeting, wo took Subject to dinner
which gave us further opportunity to talk to his. Between our arrival
in Parlas and our meeting with Subject at 1600 hours, ho' had been
occupied with business affairs so that he hid not elapet at all, was
tired.
16. He took part Subject on 17 October at 1230 hours. Subject had
spent the morning witing up his business affairs. Atter S quick lunch,
we took another room at the Califotnia Hotel where we talked with
Subject until after 1700 hours. D. urging this meeting Subject was given
the Wechsler Bellevue test. We also discussed future contact and in-
structed him to have a full medical examination done, including a
1600 hours of the 1600 hours of the 1600 hours. Likeless Sopel
was instructed to write us a detailed autoblogically running soles
than 200 pages or so from about 1939. Subject asked at the detail we
requested but said he would make an effort.
7. Subject still carries a special identity card which means he
is restritod to the Department of Fautes Alpes. However, no is able
within AS hours to get a special pase from the polico which permits him
to visit any city in France up to seven days and if he had demonstrate
that the 1600 hours of the 1600 hours of the 1600 hours of the 1600
made. Subject believes that for about French franos 50,000 he could
acquire a French identity document bearing no restriction. This would
take time; the money would be needed for legal counsel and bribes. We
also said that the 1600 hours of the 1600 hours of the 1600 hours of the
including travelling time on a false German identity document. Being
an old hand at forgery, Subject was enchanted with the idea and quite
confident he would be able to pull it off. This was discussed because
we thought it might be better and more convenient to bring Subject to
Frankfurt for an LECIFUTTER examination and assessment rather than to
do this in Paris. Subject cannot get legal permission to go outside
of France.

willing to repatriate to the Soviet Union at our behest. he believe the

up or might invent some incident in order to elais than the
possible for his to return to France. Subject does not like gap and

see that there is sufficient information on which to make with a
decision.

General Debrieing and Assossment of Subject
1. Introduction:
The Subject was extracted in Cap by Pritgarna. General familiaristaken
with him was uncertainen en rete to Paris (by car) en the night of 15/16
October 1950. Subsequently he was 30t in Paris on 16 October (afterneen)
and on 17 October, Cn the Last day the Wechsler Bellavus was given aise
further metting- and
Because of the time limitation (he was unable to stay in Paris als
be had 300 business of his own to transact), the debriefing and assessment
had to be necessarily held to general terms, the main consideration given
to Subjocts over-all life-run: the main stress put on the assessment for
REDSOK entebility.
There were no personal or security probles. Frea the beinning
Subject was willing, past asger, and co-operative. He is also willing
to co-opes: in the future and would not hesitate to take a long trip
in order to meet us again.
2. General Bierraphy
a. Pre will
Subject is a Georgian nationl. Both his parents were Georgians. He
was brought to Franco by his parents, who fled from the Soviet Union. Until
WII, he was a very good standing arona. For one or the other reason
they noved frequently. This is felt into been due to the profession of his
father, who was a graduate in non-encraiser and who probably hold an cabin-
istrative or orgineering it.
Cuing to the abavo, Subject changed scholos accordingly. He said that
he never had trouble in his studies because of a good mearry and fast retention.
Consequently, he was usually bered becauss of frequent recitions. Ocing to
boreden and possibly to some sense of opposition, he bacous usually a nuisance
of the same. Subject told us that once he had to be transferred to another
school, because he was a violent armentmentith a teacher. He mother was
quite concerned about his behaviour and took him to a paytoistratist (from Sub-
ject's narrative it is not clear that he was a good man.
In his free time ho liked to performe odd jobs, such as, for example,
fixing bicycles or holping eet in electrical repair jobs or installation,
work. He also loved to invent rapéts and odd machines.
Undoubtedly Subject had an inclination towards technical matters, On
the other hand, he had a tremendous drive to be financially independent, to
make money, and to get cash in life. It also seems that is not like:
to be employed by a person and that he alwayo strived for self-employment,
After graduating from school he attended several engineering collieres,
Ab Buegat he studied electro-angisoring. Subsequent, he enreliad in the
technicun for cinstatory. It is a fact that Subject had atulated a lot;
on the other hand, it appears that to did not produto free any of these
technical Insutations.

Appreviously in 1910, Subject collected in the Frooim Lection. He
was accepted in Paris and sent six Lysen-laborille-Port St. des to Sidi-
bel-abbes. Fabruary-Auust 1910 he was stationed in Fuzasia (Suzd.
Franc Subjoist's marraties it may be asciend that he was not a bad sediar
and that he actually liked to everyone. He said that he had been suspected for
officers' trainire but that his did not catorlatio (possibly because France
vs. occupied in the meantine). Subjects mishestn: panic was that of a the
(or equivalent thereof). Accredit to him this rune has soun protrate in
the Legion.
In the case unit with Subject there ware about 12 Georgians, a number
of Arranians, some Spaniards, and Jews. Subject knew of a so-called Georgian
Company which isequently was enicried by the Gormans; however, he did not
bolong to this company. The occupation of France in April/May 1911 send
his military carrier. He was despoliied and returned to Paris.
b. During WIT
After the discharge from the Lejon Suiject felt a great desire to
fight for France. Re told us that he loved Prance and that he wanted to
do something for his chosen herland. However, it seems that he never got
around to doing anything about this ambition. He said jckinely that norters
have been the most interested in telephone directories, and therefore
he did not know how to make the same way. On the other hand it appears
that he did not try very hard and that his today for Independent (precedural
indempedence) was greater than his high to join any collecttire resistance
activity. Thus he decided to set on his own.
He told us that at this time there was some recruitment of labour-
forces in France for Germany. He decided to enroll as Libuerer. He went
to a certain office in Paris and was sent in due course to Germany. For a
villar, he said that his office was not a possible near Berlin, Sub-
ject said that this was the only tio that he was not a possible year.
Because the Georgians were rather estonned by the Germans, he had certain
freedmas. For a while he lived with a carried German woman and renourly
peaking, it appear that he had a couple of other cril-firions on the sides.
For case reason or other be also worked in a countries plant. When playing
(cas he told us) with a small hand crandons, me of his firms was employed.
To is obscure how he obtained another job in Corrany, but it is probably
a fact that he worked as a driver for the Nark (National Socialist Party
Notional) and the same.
It is felt that Subject actually went early into the black marketing
racket, He told cithat he had traveled extensively and had been in encuined
Poland (Lods for eximale). He torned theas travels as "fun" because he had
enough money to spend (orro black market). It might also be possible that he
travelled in conjunction with the forred documents business he had begun.
It is not quite clear what preapted his to start forpinp passen into
and out of Germany. Durine the Interview he claimed that his dis was to help
imprisoned
in the to back to
plausible reason (it was mentioned that he wanted to help France), it is felt
to be the most important shift will have been leva of excitant and vish
to make many. Techically and to complete Subject want hare been an excellent
former. He told us that his culture at this cincenotreptable technica
had given him whalable techniques to be opitted to hote-machment forfety
of documents, stenps, and cachets.
It is felt that the must have had accomplices. Nevortoleas he claims
that he did not work with the French Rezinence altucuph it sirt be resuite
and probable that the rare this on or the other order to fill. It a cerca
point Subject enichs about vorkin: through internedinaries and cut-outc.
Generally. expesiter it still might be sesable that he actually verved with
to fromh. Nealutepen that does not wish to tell us.

Subject began working in Paris. Ea was employed by the firm of changes
GAR, which specialized in making models of houses. He spoke about the
firm approxilatively from 1947-1954 and was paid about F. 120 an hour.
There he not his future wife PANDOY, such, tho orriniated from Reagan
(her parents have a friend business in response and house and car).
(her parents have a friend business in response and house and car).
Subject was married in 1916. Among the 1916, the 1916 conference was a
certain ADH, John, and the 1916, and the 1916, and the 1916, which
were not a subject of the necessity to take more money. Because making
great quantities of money was quite difficult, they decided to certit rob-
borlos. It appears that. Sobjet was not against thie idens and did not propose
Adam, who had been a former schoolgate of his and with when he had lived
togettor in Vareallés.
Thisr first objective was a sinolars's state in the rns de Sec (Vema).
It seems that they broke in without much trouble and not away with F. Frs.
1,000,000 in jewelry. Adam organized the alle of the lostot. They noted
Frs. Frs. 250,000 each. It should be noted that the police had no clue as
to which the calpite had been.
The most important factor after Adam appeared at Subject's house and
apparently one year later Adam appeared at Subject's house and
blackmailed him (in from the late 1964 issue) to commit another robbery. The
object was to be shown (er actually. those workers, the proprietor of the shop
Subject did not wish to get into a fight, so they beat a hasty retrost.
Appropriately a year later the chosen objective was a bank. Adam and
Subject watched the banking house from a truck which was equipped with a
persicose. The truck was so parked es to calo it possible to observe the
tollort'd counter and this to count the incesing money. At one point Adam
wanted to�apin the hold-up, the car was a very good way to get the
tobacco. The car was a very good way to say. was against it the hold up that
of his mother). Nontristolesa, the hold-up took place, both friends entered
tho bank. Subject jumped on the counter with drom plantot. Miraculously
both pot. was. Scum tine Inter Adan was a good way to get the
tobacco. The car was a very good way to say. Subject at that tine was on his
way to cap costher with his wife, and subytor, Ellernboth. He told his
wifs the story and asked hor to fien to Satizziendl. Subject himself
decided to attempt to cross the Spanish boriera. He, having been recognized
by a chamber, was approached in this mountain. As Subject indicated
during the interview, he had not been actually too carer to fico the country.
During the ensuing investigation the the first erines were confessed
by Subject. He was anentened to solitary imprisonment (a technical torn in
France which precludes parolis).
Subject served his torn in virious rather notorious portions of France.
It appears that he road quite a lot (if and when it was possible) and also
vouried at one of his inventiona a nacine for making casabort beans. This
machine was actually built for one of the prison echinizations and put
into operation at the prison factory.
When he pot out of Jall, his wife's family concatenated to him that they
did not wish to see his any corro. As a master of fact has has not seen her
since and does not incas withor on has a carrelds. Ho told us that he would
like to get the problem, that he will only do so when he has achieved
some in life.
At present Subject is living in Gara. In to not allowed to travel without
permission from the local police. However, people treat his nornily, becomes,
as he likes to put it, "I an the brother of the brotford". Subject is pertic-
in n chemical construction fira at present specialized in existing advertising
alde (electro-chemical). It and when necessary, he prots perticien to
travol.

 explain
500 time afo Subject wrote a cira novel which until now is unpublished.
Sett appears that also ho tried to get employment with the items Burus have
find an acquaintance who had soz. contacts there. Subnet is not satisfied
with his present station. No his no position in life, and besides, he is
unable to now, and that amoye him greatly.
3. Acocescent:
Subject acroars to a quite a carlox personally. Based on so brief an
acquaintance it is still hard to tell star is never and whit is actual make-op.
It's evident that part of his present reason might have evolved in jail.
Wewortholes, jail may be regarded as only a top in Subject's evolution.
When considering the ekestery biography, the most of the
past he foit allegiance towards France and the same thing it as has
was trus in the past; it has been a very good thing. The does not like Prance
of the same thing. This is recent experience in Jail was his em fall.
Recover, he has forfeited the right to becem a citizen and with it the
possibility to fashion his career to his can-liking. However, this is not
does not know whether this is a civil, but it is not a very good thing. It
perform: dangerous, but it is not a very good thing. But it is not a
sobsc. The is was accustomed to "sews around" from childhood on.
Besides, he was always determined to ret abased in life and to make moray.
He activity during the war was positively not dictated by idelorical
motivation only. There was a definite gain to be had in time forvery. Doral
If his actions hew appear to be presented as purely idealogical energy, this
cament be completely true, because at the same time Subject states that he
enjoyed making a new way.
The reason has also to be in him a like for the clandestine and illegal
combined with a satisfaction derived from general disaster as for example
vear. Subject told us that he had an opportunity to see artillery in action
and that he liked to see then fire. He also liked to see flaming hoacco.
Tot, on the other hand, he kept himself ent of any active participation in
military action and rather concentrated on the task of producing good for-
gerise and making more.
Politically asking he hates Russians. He said that the German theory
of the British is true in regard to the Russians. Subject says that ho
dilations Cemnians but that Russians are for him the enemias par excellence.
Otherwise he has no national or racial preudices. He says that ho does not
practice any religion, however, he added, "Hilavie in your God; I shall
believe in rime".
Subject is an excellent conversationalist and definitely has the ability
to get slong with most personalities without actually accepting their ideas
or ways of thinking. He has read a lot, however, it is felt that his knowl-
edge of scientific nattors (the has claimed to show such knowledge) is based
on par-ocientific literature which he was disincirinately.
Subject is an individhualt. He is probably there ruthless in further-
in
his personal inters. is. His present article 1 to be soebeely in life,
It is this officer's opinion that Subnet is rather suitable for RUSOX.
He has the traits of a born chich, and is better and a liking for the dangerous
and illigai. Physically he has healthy and enduring (proven by his long sky
and is a very good thing. It is hima easily and is asellitating easily. On the
other hand, his handling right sanctions present problens, because he may act
implitively and ruchly boliving that that he does la the right thing to do.
It is this effecier's feeling that必helt rightiormities not think cattors
over purferring to noke map decisions andi to act accordingly.

Preliminary Assessment of
1. Brief Biography
Subject 1a a No-year-old Georgian calsro living in Cop, Raubos
Alpes, France: Together with his parents, brother and sister he moved
from the disintegrat.9. Georgian Rescible in 1921 to Pranie where he
have lived ever incoe, except for about three years during world War
II when he worked voluntarily in Germany as a scien-skilled laborer,
which is a very good way to make the same way. He is a very
1941, having served for the most part in North Africa. While in
Germany he developed a skill at forging documents which he used to
holip French officers to escape to France. He was arrested, convicted
of a 1946 and 1947 which had been in the same way. He is to
Parte. In 1946 and 1947 Subject committed to armed robberies. In
1949 he robbed a bank in Paris, subquient to which he has caught,
convicted and sentenced to ten years, which was later reduced to five
by the terms of a general anxiety. Since his release in 1955 subject
has lived in dog where his brother lives and works as a rectorately
in the past. He has subjected us married in 1947, divorced in 1950
while in prison. He has been a daughter, born before his arrived, and a
sen, born while he was in private.
2. Comments on Contact and Debriefing
Subject was contacted by Anthony H. Friganza in Dig. can 15 October
1958, having been assessed and prepared for the contact by APADIZA, an
old friend of Subject's, in February 1958. Shortly after the 11st
meeting with Frignanza, Subject met Patrick B. Nevens and Peter K. Win-
ship. In the course of meetings lasting a total of about 22 hours he
has been the most important role in the work of the Project.
Bellevue psychological text, was made. There was no difficulty in
authenticating ourselves with Subject and in the course of our con-
versations, we got no indication that Subject did not answer the
question. The fact that the most important question was to be subject
perhaps tried to please for it is clear that Subject would like a job,
almost any job, with us because his present situation in Gap. is re -
strictive and holds no proce of a future. But, Subject by nature is
the most important question. The fact that the most important question
naturally to answer. specific questions in a general way. Noteworthy
and indicative is the fact that the only birth date Subject knew was
his own; he did not know his parents', his wife's or even his brother's
question. The fact that the most important question was to be subject
to pin him down to hard facts. When dealing with ampiecunances or
toungy matters, Subject is cut to philosophic as he did when he was
asked questions about the current rolationchip of his brother and his
new wife. Rather than give opinions on facts about the girl, he noted
that the most important question was to be subject to the fact that
very Gallic and probably true, but only in a round-about way at best
does it express Subject's personal views on the question under dis.
ousion. No attempt to be tough with Subject was made and thore was no
occasion when he conveniently could have challenged his sincerity or
reversity, or be ant been he Subject
he would guess that he would adopt a take-it-or-leave-it attitude. He
is not a very good way.
3. Education, Languages and Cultural Standing
Subject probably has a better-than-average formal education for a
Prenclssan who did not and never planned to so on to a university. He
has a fair lay knowledge of history but in ill interested (c) details.
Subject is aseething of a scientific dilutant, interated in the elor,
gugata, colorful and mechanical, and probably the agent of estatific
and pseudo-identifie things and issue. His knowledge is broad but not
deep in made thing it to about as deep as Fopular Resources, but in
other in hows unidemally very.

Subjec: claims to speak chegion w. th native lueney. He may
speak it well but wo venture that it is pot the ause language currently
being spoken in Georgia, this probably boing so if eot tobacco has has
been the most common thing. He is the most important, but he is
much, if at all. He speaks, reads and wricos fromh with native
fluency. Actually, French is his native language; at lease he onl-
culates in French. He speaks and reese Gerwan will and la capable of
expressing himself quite fully in it. He understands English and can
way. simple thinge in it. Subject says he is able to understand and
separately have a little sense.
Culturally Subject is French. His manneries are French, as avr
his habits. If there is anything particularly oegrian about Subject,
it is not noticeable. We would guess that subject was brought up in
not too well-to-do middle cluns circunstances but under the influence
of his parents who had had a much better, possibly even prospopuis,
banet.
4. Character and personality: It is. afe to describe Subject as
independent and as a man who instinctively prefer to take his chisboses
relying on his own abilities and resources in order to avoid com-
promising his independence by assuming constituents. He is a long wolf
type. We guess that Subject behaves this way partly because he has an
exaggerated notion of his competence, and partly because he is in-
terested in the same way. He is a very good thing. He is a very
given though Subject needs people and likes company, he does not want
to have his affairs, particularly his business affairs, dependent on
others. There are several points which support this: By his com
administration (which, but not the most important) is the same way
to be forced to make between his record and that of his brother: His has
been unruly, irregular, troublesome, and ho has attained very little;
his brother became an officer in the French aray (even though he was
foreign born) and is now a so-sou successful architect. Also, wo sum-
pect that we have not yet, goiton the full story on Subject's marriage
and the way to the Image Subject surried universally, lost face than his
family, and or was considered a low type mate by his wife's family over
before he was arrested.
One of the underlying reasons he is not interested in the
is that the most important, but he is not noticed that he did not
wait for questions we wished to put to him to be fully forced. He
tends to interrupt in order to supply usually interesting and acsintines
even pertinent information. He seems unable to bide his time. We
doubt that Subject has they disflable moral or other standards. In any
case, the question of the question of the question of the question of
conclusion which appealed to him to begin with, or he simply overlooks
the certain significant issue. " Still, Subject is not amoral or a
criminal type. We believe no knowa right and wrong, sometimes con-
sidered that the question of the question of the question of the question
His trouble is that not having any way to do very and/or decant.
normal contradictions which he can't solve and frequently is uniauro of
because he doesn't really care. We doubt that Subject's aorals con-
cerning drinks, wean, gospbing and the other vices differ greatly at
most from the average person of approzimately the same background. To
report, it is not that Subject has no standards -- his are just differen1
and peculiarly his own.

We believe that Subject is sentimental but is ashamed of being
no; he makes a jake of it. He wants to be liked by people and realizes
that cost people find his interesting, entertaining and attractive.
We think that Subject unccasiously gives an important place to
the most important and most important. We have been able to
is mature about such things but still so think he would stick by a
friend in trouble, perhaps to the point of foolishness. Because
Subject has the winning personality be does, he has never been obliged
to retain friends and/or acquaintances because he knows he will al-
though the most important, but it is not a subject more than
once distinguished between a friend and an acquaintance, and in so many
words stated that he has had very few friends as such.
Subject deenistrated that he is able to reason and to do so
very well. He saw the solution of logical and algebraic probless he
is the most important. While attempting to solve those problems,
Subject reasoned well enough, we should that his memory is perhaps not
as good. Subject knew his own date of this truth and hardly any other of
course, he had no interest in the others.
Subject is perceptive and is able to combine his perception
with his ability to reason. He made several remarks which indicated
that he saw through the behaviour of certain peremalities, political
questions; etc., which the question. Subject is observant but we
didn't have been able to think that the other his powers of
observationalism are excellent or simply above average.
Subject has a winning percmality and is quite capable in
dealing with people. He listens well, talks rapidly and at length
without attempting to monopolize the convesation. He is quite will-
be able to think that he has been able to learn he hears exacms
eine speak up who is apparently better informed, and he has
if his interest has been aroused. We would guess that Subject would
be particularly well suited to dealing with the public. He nicely
combines pseudo-attentiveness and Galile chame.
We should that Subject, we hope and almost certainly
would not have to be, difficult job for very long. We doubt
he would simply quit in a huff; he would far prefer to rationalize and,
if necessary, to manufacture excuses for releas. Cernceted with this
is the possible character weakness in Subject concerning his reliability
of the world. It is not a subject to the fact that the subject
get drunk but if he personally did not understand and appreciate to
importance of the job, he would be inolined to let it slide or ignore
it. An excellent point in Subject's favor is that he could not be
brove beaten or easily domiciled. For instance, we doubt that even the
subject is not a subject to the fact that the subject is not a
did not wish to say. To preclude any such ericis, Subject would be
glib, second guess his interrogators, invent facts or at least ro-
arrange them to suit whatever purpose he might have in mind. Subject
to the fact that the subject is a man of superior intelligence (at
least considerably superior to the subject's product and what
sufficiently informed about Subject's performance so that he could
cachic out Subject in any one of his subjucts.
Subject is a materialist because he has the idea that material
subjoens is necessarily the support to respectability, social success,
and the subject is not a subject. The subject is not a subject.
Subject is too unhappy or emotionally ambalanced at the present time;
he enjoys the very curairee life he leads. lie think that because
Subject has this desire for material gain and hence respeatability,
the subject is not a subject. The subject is not a sufficient
to win his loyalty and choichered cooperation. This is not a say
that the anti-ccumnist atruggle for good and against evil means
nothing to his. It does, of course, and he might undertake dangerous
work for the love of adventure, but he would do so with a great deal
more verve and-conviction if he wore sure of the pot of gold at the
end of the road.

apparcial of his own position, possibilities for the future, his past,

least not. for very long. be think he would. work hard at learning any

situations in order to avoid trouble, discomfort, and work.
6. Millingness and motivation: Concerning a
a repatriation mission under our direction, we think Subject is sincere
and correct in claining he is a willing candidate. We doubt that he
would attempt to beg off at the last concept. He is no physical coward.
However, Subject is willing for REBOX because in it he sees a way out
the most important thing. He is a good thing that is the most
to go. Because ho has a criminal record he is unable to build a future
for himself in France, and he is unable to travel in order to look for
possibilities. He has been. called to a kick town where he is paried
to his brother who in to case extent responsible for his ga cod behaviour.

element of adventure in his willingness but any adventurous ideas would
immediately evaporate if Subject were a French citizen and had a
financially successful business. Subject is anti-Communist, etc., we
have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
cynical to permit such notions to play much of a role. If he were given
the idea that KUEARK demands fiery anti-Communist motivation, Subject
would do his best to convince us that that is what he is. Subject in
so many words said that one of his prime desires was to get out of
the same way. We have to be able to be able to be able to be able to
of American citizenship would weigh in heavy and a factor in Subject's
willingness to undertake almost any REBOX crisis regardless of the
danger. In a word, Subject's motivation is material.
7. Handling of Subject: The handling of Subject from this point
on must be ruthless and calculated. We think that Subject would be
neither shocked per offended by such handling; as a matter of fact he
is a good thing that is that he is a good thing that is that he
than the absoluto minimum he needs to survive until the class: on had
been completed. If Subject is removed from France, some means must
be found to convince Subject that we can dispose of him to an area or
a place at least as disadvantageous to Subject as his present one is.

Subject would not necessarily need to be trained in French as this is
the only language in which he is perfectly fluent. Even though his
Georgian is very good, it is not current and he could be used only on
a black mistaken. He appears to be physically regued and in good con-
dition. We have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to

were subsequently cancelled, a given pack and a top, to could be
rectified in any South America country without difficulty.
8. Recommendation
(a) We hope there is sufficient information en Subject now
recorded on which Headquarters will be able to decide if Subject is of
interest for REBOX or not. If he is, he should be further debriefed
and interregated and given the LCLUTTER test. The LCLUTTER test could
be given in Paris or Frankfurt.

If it is given in Paris there will be a less favorable climate,
some risk will be taken that we might have difficulties with the French,
and we might face several operational problems in getting a secure
house, etc.
If the test is given in Frankfurt, Subject would necessarily
need to travel here on a pheney German Re:enouwels (which we consider
he could use properly from the language point of view). The principal
risk in bringing Subject to Frankfurt is that Subject might have an
accident or be might manufacture socae reason not to return. In either
case we might have a valid disposal problem en our hands and we
might be able to be agreed is as-
We would prefer to bring Subject to Frankfurt because we be-
lieve that Subject is bona fide and would be unlikely to double cross
us.
(b) We wish to emphasize that this is a preliminary assese
ment and recommendation. With that caveat we would recommend Subject
for a fully black REDSOX mission which requires: (1) able bodiness,
(2) superior intelligence (considering the calibre of person who is
not a very good reason for the training power, (3) willingness to under-
take an extremely hazardous mission. (4) a number of questions
(5) basic technical mechanical, and pseudo-acientific abilities.
We would hesitate at this point to recommend Subject for a repatriation
mission e:en though he is willing because we question whether Subject
has the resolve-or patience for such a task.

TO
: Chief, SR
Date: JUN 1 3 1958
PRON
: Chief of Basse, Prenkfurt
INFO: EE, WE, cos, PARIS
SUBJECT: General - Operational/RETOOD/RECOX/ARACTS
Specific - REUSOX Candidate in France
References: OPEN 20928, dated 23 May 1958 301-207137
Action requested: Please advise if it is desired
that we contact and assese Subject
1. subject of this dispatch in the person thought to have genuine
REDSOI potential mentioned in the first paragraph of reference.
2. Subject was described to us by APFADDLE before the latter con-
cated him in France and from the report submitted under reference, it
would appear to us that he may be even better than first day.
We have noted the pros and conditions of the following and would like
to be a member of the man in the latter. It would seem to us that the
fact that Subject is an parole ought to make little difference, as far
as his candidacy for REDCOX. is concerned. Surely a means can be devised
to reope him from France so that he will neither have the same
case. The fact that the fact that the subject is probably because he has left.
He might emigrate to South America, which we probably could help him
achieve. He could move to North Africa and disappear from thero. If the
fact that Subject is on parole is thought to be a handicap because it re-
flects on his character, it is not a possible thing to be a possible thing
to be a person? applies equally to this case. The matter of relatives
in Georgia being considered an a con is diffioult for us to understand,
but we assume thore must be some special circumnetances which make it so.
Generally speaking, we should have thought this do be a positive factor-
of the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that such
must be assumed in every case, notwithstanding what the Subject in
question may think. The preuemed surveillance becomes a problem when it
is time to remove a candidate for training, which calls for a smooth
cover for his disappearance ( cf. Espana, 1958, 1960, 1961).
The fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that we close to the contact
hourly. About the last point: Unica, there are some special reasons not
explained in reference why contacting Subject is difficult, we believe
that we could do this accurately and without attracting attention. The
seens of authenticating the approach outlined in reference should be
eapie - assuming that APFADDLE's arrangements are firm.

very close to Noe JORDANA. He has sone writing ability, and
had an article published last month in a journal of the anti-Rustan
group of the Georgians (possibly knowa as Notre Patrie) which is
published by Micha STOURGUA (STRAWA). BURESHVILL belongs
to this group and writes for newspapers: He went two or three times
to Georgia on illegal misions. The last time he was wounded in
the lower right legs, and was helped by a companion. He did not

BERESHVILL says there are orgahed Ccorgia groups willing to
fight the Ausians.
Since 1953 BERESHVIII has been contacted two or three
times by the Americans, but nothing has come of this, and he
feels the Americans are not following up properly. He said the
latest attempt involved a letter written to him in Russian, giving
him a telephone number to call. Before calling it he tried to
trace the number through consections of his wife's. He feels that
contact with Georgia is important if the emigration organizations
are to be representative of the feelings in the homeland.

3. At a convention of National Domcrates in Parla, ALPADDLE
met A. MIPLAN from Lédon. KIFLANE is a former calonal of
the Folicah Army and works closely with General ANDERS.
KIFLANI suggested working through An. orican isotiligence. and
will send AEPADDLE a letter for making contact with the Anders group
in the US.
1. AEFADDLE carried money (Apparently from NY Coorglaas)
Paris to assist the publication and distribution of an emigre paper.
3. Soth the Socialists and National Democrats would like to organise
a group for commese action. une drewback is that the Socialists
apparently want to play down anti-cormunism (as opposed to
Georgias separatism) and also win: to have- nothing to do with the
American Committee in Munich. Nos TISNSADZ E., the principal
calaborator with the American Committee refused to break the
connection or to drop the anti-cammunist line.
6. There are no really young Georgian-bora people in Parle, but
there 373 about 50 or 60 second generation Georgians, who speak
Freach among themsalves, but have some interest in Cergia
affaire. The visit of the Georgian ballet estimaled this interest,
and some of these youngsters are eager to visit Georgia.
7. The Gerinaas are trying to set up an information link with the
Caucasus. Concerned with this activity are Mica ALCHISAYA
and inu MENDO, the Cercan officer in charge who was interested
in the Causause during w W II. So far nothing concrete has
been accomplished. AEPADDLE received this information from
PATARDZL, who has been to Munch in connection with this activity.

POW's to escape, alidg them with false papers, stamps and
uniforms. He was able to travel from Dernin to Paris, and
AEPADDLE saw him in Paris on one occasion during the war.

released about one or two years ago, and is required to live in

prison sentence and redcem himself as a man. He wants to
acquire citizenship where he can feel he belongs. preferably US
citizenship) Money le secondary with him. AEPADDE says
that Subject needs to have written instructions and guidance in
order mottis to overboard and exceed the proper limits.
AEPADDE requested and received from Subject two
copies of subject's name written backward. AEPADDE
explained that this would serve as bora fides for anyone who
might want to contact Subject in the future.

he reads or writes well), r rechn, Gerzan and a little English.
AEPADDE described him as sensitive, and wanting respect.
