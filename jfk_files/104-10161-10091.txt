LEAST AS FAR AS GOV IS CONCERNED. CAP AND GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN
HAVE ALL STATED THAT INCIDENT HAS ENDED AND ARE NOW TRYING TO
DIVERT ATTENTION TO OTHER SUBJECTS. MEDIA COVERAGE IS RETURNING
TO NORMAL WITH STORIES OUT OF HEADLINES AND BACK ON PAGE SIX OR
EIGHT, SUPERSE DED BY NIEHOUS CASE, UGAND AN SITUATION, OPEC PRICE
HIKE, ETC. UNFORTUNATELY, EVERY VENEZUELAN WEEKLY MAGAZINE HAS
LONG ARTICLE (S) ON CIA WHICH ARE, OF COURSE, DEFAMATORY, AND
TEND TO WHIP UP PUBLIC ANTIPATHY TOWARDS AGENCY. THEN TOO, THERE
IS STILL MATTER OF DEMONSTRAT ION AGAINST CIA WH ICH TWO DAYS AGO
CAP SEEMED TO BE INSITATING IN TWO MEETINGS WITH JOSE VICENTE
R A N G E L AND POMPEYO M A R Q U E Z OF MAS AND JESUS
F A R I A OF THE PCV. NEVERTHELESS, ON THE WHOLE, THE INTEREST
IN THIS ISSUE SEEMS TO BE DROPPING OFF AND DYING OUT RATHER
RAPIDLY.

3. LIAISONS WI TH DIM AND DISIP CONTINUE AS BEFORE- IF
ANYTHING, ODDLY WE ARE GETTING A LITTLE MORE OUT OF THESE
ASSOCIATIONS THAN BEFORE THE FLAP. AMB ASSADOR'S INSTRUCTIONS ON
LIAISON BEFORE HE LEFT ON CONSULTATION VISIT WERE "BUSINESS AS
USUAL AND LET THEM MAKE FIRST BREAK IF THEY WANT TO". IT WAS
AMBASSADOR'S OPINION THAT WHILE CAP WAS BLASTING CIA PUBLICLY HE

ALTHOUGH AMBASSA DOR, STILL
SOME THING OF A POLLYANNA AT SUCH TIMES, SERIOUSLY UNDER RESTIMATED
24
CAPIS INTENTION TO [PNG TWO OF US] AN ACT ION WHICH CAME WITHIN
246
ONE HOUR OF OCCURING. ANYWAY, THRO UGOUT ALL OF THIS BOTH DIM
AND DISIP HAVE CONTINUED THEIR CONTACTS AND HAVE TRIED TO BE AS
24
FRIENDLY AND UNDER STANDING, PERHAPS EVEN COVERTLY HELPFUL, AS

SITUATION WOULD ALLOW. TYPICAL OF [LIAISON] ATTITUDE IS DIM, COLONEL

HAVING DISCUSSED A VARIETY OF TOPICS OF (COMMON OPS] INTEREST,

CATALAN JASKED CRYMM, "WELL OTHERWISE, HOW ARE THINGS GOING?"
CRYMM REPLIED, " YOU WHOULD KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT", TO WH ICH

CATALAN] SAID, SOME WHAT GLUMLY, " YET, I SUPPOSE SO".
4. WE SHOULD NOT FOOL OURSEL VES IN THINKING THAT THE WORLD
HERE IS NOT DIFFERENT, HOWEVER. WKS CARLET-9 COVERLY REPORTED
THAT DISIP HAS DEF IN ITELY TAPPED AT LEAST COS'S HOME PHONE,
LIAISON OFFICER'S OFFICE LINE, AND TELEPHONES OF EX-COS LABANOW
AND JOE MANN, LOCAL NEW YORK TIMES REPRESENTATIVE. CAP HIMSELF
INSTRUCTED DISP DIRECTOR TO GO OUT AND GET CIA AND INDICATED TO
AMBASSADOR HE WAS HAVING SECURITY SERVICES LOOK INTO CIA
CONTACT IN VENEZUELA, PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH JOURNALISTS. TWICE

IN LAST COUPLE OF DAYS STATION CASE OFFICERS HAVE ENCOUNTERED
WHAT CERTAINLY APPEARED TO BE SURVEILLANCES. WKIDET-3 REPORTS
THAT LAST WEEK CUBAN AMB ASSADOR HERNANDEZ V IS ITED CAP AND PROVIDED
HIM A LIST OF ALL CIA PERSONNEL AND AGENTS THE CUBANS KNOW TO
BE OPERATING IN VENEZUELA. so, AS CAN BE SEEN BY ALL OF THIS,
THE RELATIVELY EASY OPERATING CONDITIONS OF THE RECENT PAST NO
LONGER PERTAIN- PERHAPS THEY NEVER WILL AGAIN- AND WHILE WE ARE
NOT BECOMING PARANOID NOR WILL WE BE UNDULY SPOOKED, WE HAVE
ADJUSTED TO THE NEW AMBIENTE AND ARE NOW BEING MUCH MORE
CONSERVATIVE AND CAUTIOUS IN OUR ACTIVITIES THAN BEFORE.
