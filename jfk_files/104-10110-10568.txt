Chief, Chicago Field office
Hargrave Secret Service
1, Al Thompson recently asked me for my opinion
of Hargrave Secret Service, 6 West Randolph Street,
Chicago, insofar is thet potential is concerned.
24
2. Chicago Field office files contain no infor-
mation on the company. The Chicago telephone directory
reflects the company was formed in 1888 and has offices
and/or representatives in the principal cities of the
world. (See attached Redbook ad).
3. Local F&K contacts had no information concern-
ing the company. Albert Johopion, an ex-F&H man who has
operated a private detective agency in Chicago for years
told me that George E. Hargraveris sole owner and is
the son of the founder. As Johnson described Hargrave
as & big, 250 pound man who has been married five times.
In business, he is the type to put on a big show and is
not averse to putting more men than necessary. on a job
in order to charge his client a higher price and profit
81732
accordingly. Mr. Johnson said that, although Hargrave
advertises offices throughout the world he doubts that
these are any more than investigative correspondents.
4. A casual inquiry put to Richard Cain, Chief
Investigator, Cook County Sheriff's office, brought forth
the comment that Cela distructs Hargrave. He said he
knows him personally and does not regard him as a discreet
person.
5. In view of the above, Cover may vent to reconsider
using Hargrave.
