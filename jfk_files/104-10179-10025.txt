shipment had been successfully initiated to his group during his absence
and su's urged that now such interest should be eteposed u. in the future.
ROBERT then briefly discussed the SINR. osterican and asked ANUNG-1 if he
didn't thank this area for the E. wa. already "known due to the number of
people who alr-ady knew of this oeration. (This includes S other people
besides ANUN-1 and A ANG-1.) ANUN-1 stited he was not sure, not would
be a very good thing. The most important, but the most important, the
lent D2 ate and should be utilized for any cutsequent airdrop scheduled in
the Pinar del Rio province
ROGERS INFORVED ANUNG-1 that his ovarizys on
various L2's and L2's had been received and woro being reviewed by the opera-
tion of the American American Association. The American American
grupher and expressed the view that these ZC areas would be cut to good use.
Finally, ho assured ANUNG-1 that no stono is being left unturned to provide
his grow, with the necessary materiel supor! which is critically needed and
that this sup ort kill be step ed up as our infiltration esophilities are in-
terested in the American American Association. The American American
any unnecessy changes when he resumed operational activities in Cuba, since
his leadership in the ANUN group was vital to our overall interests. The

5. Sora of the more significant highlights of the conv-rastions which
tork place between ANUNG-1 and the undersigned prior to his meetings with the
w/'s operator (Francisco) and Riegers are noted herewith:
a. Security: Castro his taken stringent acti in writing up
his internal security a. ainst counter-continuity forces inside
the American American Association. He has been a. search houses for concealed
weapons (usually by a hick system), and anyone failing to produce
proper identification is reorvod for questioning by the DIER.
Hence, ANUNG-1 and his organizati. are largely confining their
information about daylight hours from 0700 to 2000 hours. He
considers night or night. particularly on the streets of Havana -
as highly dangerous inasmuch as the Cill (security orian) are
constantly on the alert to stop individuals on the street to check
their identificatich documents.
b. Documentati in of A. ents in Cuba: AVW0-1 surgested using an
identificati n card issued by the Havana University for their
students. He had a sample copy in his possession, which he claims
that the American American Association is a very good way to
Similarly, a driver's license properly authenticated along with a
health certificate were considered to bo goad "cover" documents
for agents operating in the Havana area. A supply of blank identi-
fication cards will be turned over to the Staties by A. SRA-1 top

agents who can be passed off as students at the Harana University.
(Ho suggested preparing one for the w/T operator (Francisco).
c. Operaticai Expenditurs: Cueled on this aspect, USING-1 stated
his organiza: 11. could need a minimum of 50 to 60,400 resos a
month to cover their cverall operational expenses. These funds are
being used for safheouse maintenance, travel expenses, purchase of
vehicles and gasoline, allocation of funds to various sub-
factors. The cost of the new business is 1.1. vs provinces of
Cuba, and purchase of food and sup:ort of varicus and tobacco
families may be in dire need of food and medical sur:lies.
d. W/T o.eorators: To date, both APEANIC-14 and AVCENG-1 have net
net the requirements for effective cosunicatior with us on AVTM
operat. cns. However, AFTNG-1 feels that APEANIC-14 has not been
compromised or turned by the OIM and once he reis over his nervous
and social conditions. The cost of the new business is 1.1. vs
A'CLEN-1 is considered to be a 10 d W/T operator, AFTNG-1 feels
his usefulness to hi: has been considerably no:ated by the nature
of his assignment at the Naval base and his recent restrictions
of the U.S. and the U.S. and U.S. and U.S. are not a single
feels con-uncation is the weakost link in his current operations
and that direct con-unicati:ns with the Embasay is growing in-
crossingly hazardous, due to the fact that Embassy rescennel re
under close surveillance by the Castm: security forces. For this
reason he feols that Francisco will fill a serious veil in this
tubpect, once he is infiltrated into the AMITR organization in

Villas, Carzuny of Orienta) without jeopardizing both shiprents
and version el. Amees, the need for unilateral action on our
part to aup. y those fighting groups in these provinces. This
is a major hazard to satisfy ANRNG-1, however he still insisted
that his organizati n should at least be appraised of any ratleriel
support provided other groups in Cuba. He was assured that we
would take his request under consideration.
f. ANDIDY-1: AFRUNO-1 feels that n: useful purpose would be served
in sending his a: social: to join forces with. he in Havana. He
feels that AFRUNO-1 shoel: the nation's most important. the A'YON
opinion in the FDJ. when the counter-ri-voluntary forces are
fullying forced to overthrow the Castro regire, AFRUNO-1 will be
brought into the Pillar del Rio to direct the AFTY forces in this
province.
c. Nanoio Ray: AURUNO-1 considers BAY as a family dan-erouse individual
of the American American adult smoker to play a greintor role in any
subsequent Cuban gov. rameat following the o-orthrow of the Castro
rogie. In his opinion, RAY poses a ser:113 threat to VANNA's
leadership, and the FRD inside Cuba. He is attempting to draw
various dissident groups to hit the American American support
of the American American United States, listed by business interests, politicians,
and the professional class. Should RAY be persuaded to join
forces with the FRD, ANRNG-1 thinks he will continue to operate
on a unilateral basis while seeking to supersede the FRD with
his con crganization in Cuba.
h. Tony Varona and the Although AFRUNO-1 recognizes the need
to promote the forces a political front for rallying counter-
r-voluntary group. against the Castro regie, he n: netheless
feels that the FRENIE and Tony VENVA h.ve lost considerable face
in Cuba by inaction and political raneuv-ring. He is a very good
opinion of the American American community. He had been poured into
the FRA-15; but dissident groups in Cuba h.ve seen no evidence of
any of this money to sup ort their efforts to verthrow Castro.
Hance, confidence in the F:0 is at a relatively low level of the
tobacco industry. He is a very good group of the form of materiel
and financial support is needed to restate this confidence.- Ac-
cording to AFRUNG-1 this eup. ort must be forticoring soon because
such po:te as Panolo RAY are taking the initiative and will soon
control the entire counter-revelcut onary movement in Cuba.
