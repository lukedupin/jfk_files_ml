4 September 1973
RESTRICTIONS ON OPERATIONAL USE OF CERTAIN
CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS
Rescission: CSI 50-10, 13 July 1970
1. GENERAL
a. Elemental in the conduct of clandestine operations is the use of human
agents to accomplish the missions of the Operations Directorate. In gen-
eral, it is DDO policy to select agent assets with primary regard to the
agents' abilities, target access, and security, and with few restrictions as
to their origins, professions or status as members of particular groups. The
organizations is that any consenting adult may be used by the Operations
Directorate, here are, however, certain sensitive categories of individuals
or groups who operational use by the Operations Directorate is prohibited
or in some way restricted for reasons not necessarily related to security
considerations.
b. These prohibitions or restrictions stem from one of the following:
(1) The Agency has been directed by U.S. Governmental authority to
restrict or avoid the operational use of a particular category of in-
vestigation.
(2) The Agency has entered into a special restrictive agreement with an
organization, government, corporation, or official responsible for a
category of individuals.
(3) The Director or the Deputy Director for Operations has imposed
restrictions on the operational use of a certain category of individuals
due to the extreme risk or sensitivity of such exploitation.
2. PURPOSE
The purpose of this instruction is to set forth the prohibitions and policy
restrictions (as distinguished from security restrictions) which currently per-
tain to the operational use of various categories of individuals, together with
the special approval procedures to be followed in certain cases. Where ap-
propriate, reference has been made to another publication which provides
more detailed guidance than has been attempted in this instruction. The
special approval procedures set forth in this instruction do not supersede or
alter in any way the requirements for covert approval contained in DOI
and DOLF 10-5.

3. DEFINITIONS
Within the context of this instruction, the definitions listed below will apply.
Special note must be taken of the fact that the key term "operational use"
employed throughout this instruction has been defined in the most succinct
manner consistent with clarity. It has not been feasible, however, to cover in
a definition the entire scope of possible variations in operational circumstances
which may be encountered in DDO activities. The definition of "operational
use" is intended to provide guidance for the majority of cases, and must be
employed with responsible operational judgment. Issues involving a deter-
mination of "operational use" which cannot be resolved with reasonable as-
surance by the responsible operating components will be referred to the
issue of the definition.
a. Operational Use
Operational use is interpreted to mean the recruitment, utilization, or train-
ing of any individual or group for DDO purposes on either a writing or
conformity, or the number of the behalf of an element of the Operations Direc-
torate. Utilization is made of an individual or group whenever that in-
dividual or group, responding to the direction or solicitation of a DDO
element, provides information, performs services, provides cover, or supplies
financial, material, or other support necessary for the accomplishment of
DDO operational objectives either directly or indirectly, to or for an ele-
ment of the Operations Directorate.
b. DDO Element
Any person or group who or which is responsible to, owned or controlled
either directly or indirectly by the Operations Directorate. Included under
this definition are employees or members of Agency proprietary mech-
anism.
c. Operational Contact
Any association having as its purpose the initiation or furtherance of DDO
operations.
4. RESTRICTIONS ON OPERATIONAL USE
