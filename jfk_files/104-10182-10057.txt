and others can current REBSOX: Nostodt and Friganza departed to meet subject at
about 1130 hrs. taking extreme precautions against surveillance.
Subject did not appear at the rendezvous at 12 hours. We waited until 1234
hours when Friganza decided to visit: market to determine it for the
end. We were asked to determine the performance of the rendezvous
in route to Annick Friganza. The market was the greatest in the rendezvous
of the 12 hours. We were asked to visit with Subject. Subject had apparently gone to the
conges 11 rendezvous (which is understandable considering the hurried circumstances
of the previous parting when the rendezvous was discussed), had waited perhaps 1/2
and 1/2. The market was the greatest in the 12 hours. We were asked to visit 1/2. We

re-entered, looked here. Subject who caught the significance of Nostodt's extra-
ordinary and 1/2. recorded the taxi around the corner, paid him his due fare, and
redered. Nostodt, it was at this moment that Friganza returned on intuition.
The trio then went tc lunch, taking a circulious route by foot and taxi. Cover
lunch from about 13-15 nuns Hosted had an opportunity to acquaint himself with
Subject and to put to Subject several questions concerning the new.
After lunch Friganza and founted decided, we consider the circumstances it would
be added to the next day. We had a great chance that risk his arrest travelling between
Paris and Ambrt or returning to Gap to have his sarte d'identite revalidated.
Accordingly while Rosted spent the next 11 hrs. or so with Subject, Friganza
returned tc the Paris Station where he asked for the use of is rue wcher safahouse.

assigned for the use of AENSPIC. Arrangements were made to have Platipodia who
knows Subject to be at the safehouse at 160 hours (alternate 250 hrs. ) on 8 April.
Subject was instructed to go to the afbhouse, ring 1 longs, 2 month, and
1000 hours. We were asked to visit the next day. We were asked to visit the next
old that in the eve: of unavoidable. nquiry he should claim that he had been lent
the apartment by Tom Brown, a friend of John Sandor. He was instructed not to
answer the phone and not immediately to answer the door. If after persistent ringing
he felt obliged to answer the door, he should pretend he had drunk too much wine,
and the other. We were asked to the door appearing grogy. Subject was
urther instructed to stay In the same day. We were driving slightly home and to venture out
at night only if necessary to buy food. He was told that Friganza could
return for him sometime between 1, and 16 April.
Between 6 and 8 April Subject will stay with Annick During the day he will
avoid the house, going to movies, etc. Sponsring only at night to sleep.
Subject was paid Friganza 49,874 (Sincerely 87700).

The undersigned arrived in Paris on the morning of the 25th of Marth and went to
the s'efebouse where the L'ELPIUTER operator had spent the night and was ahortly
to meet Subject at the Cafe Les Sport near the Port Mailto. Subject passed by
as we were having beuring coffee and according to Instnctium's waited elsewhere. We
left while the operator collected Subjec: and tock ha to the house, enabling us
to receive an hour of time.
Subject was dismissed for lunch at about 1145, whereupon the operator and
the undersigned returned to the Embassy office where after a quick lunch the
questions for the examination were written. The operator met Subject, returned
to the house, and began the examination at about 130, it having been agreed
to be given to the American Association for the meeting of the American
operator had not concluded the examination but there was sufficient time to
continue which he did. The examination was completed about 1845 hours, whereupon
we were informed by the operator that in his opinion Subject was not attempting
to deceive on any important points, even though some of the more prosaic aspects
of his work were not in the same way.
We then discussed future meeting arrangements with Subject: Subject will
appear in front of the Cafe Georges V on the Champs Elysees at 1214 and 16 hours
on 6 April. He will wait for five minutes in front of the cafe but will hot
enter. If we are not. not there he-will return for the alternate. In any event
we are not. for the night we will be given to the American operator. We
up his affairs in Abert and be prepared to depart for Germany however, it was
also explained to Subject that we were not authorized to make a final commitment
to Subject and that much as we regretted this, this would be left until 6 April.
In the morning, we will be given to the American operator to be given to
in a hurry to catch a plane for the Hague. If Subject has any difficulties he
will write Annick. He will not return to Gap. He expects to stay with Josef
Dassaud in Abert until the night of 5 April when he will travel to Paris by
train. It was further agreed that on or about 4 or 5 April Subject will have
sent a letter to Annikfor "Mike" in which he will conform his arrival and in
double talk inform us if he has had any trouble.
We discussed with triaptoids of the Paris station the need to send "Maurice"
to Annick on 4 or 5 April to see if Subject had written.

Dates of interview: 8, 9, 10 Jan 1959
Subject: PAVID
1. Subject was met in Paris by the case officer and examiner and
submitted to an intenlve preliminary paychological examination. He was
examined via a French interpreter. The interpreter has been requested to
submit his own assessment to the underzigned.
2. Subject is 10 years of age. He was born on the 12th of July.
1918, in Georgia, USSR. At that time Georgia was a free country and not
part of the USSR.
3. Subject regards his parents as "nobles" and he feels that their
statua had a great influence on his behaviour in the period which followed
the family's immigration into France in 1921.
4. Subject feels he acquired a certain prejudicial class attitude
and abided by the principle of noblesse oblige. In other words he feels
that if you pretend to be something, you have to act accordingly. His
concept of nobility has evolved into a concept of dignity and pride in his
work.
5. The family left Georgia when the Subject was three. They fled
before the Soviet invasion. Subject feels that his real existence began
at this point. Because the father had provided himself with certain monies,
the family was able to live comfortably and even opulently. However, the
vicissitudes of life brought the family progressively to material degradation
and financial difficulties which greatly influenced Subject's way of think-
ing thereafter. Whereas the family had previously lived in an artificial
feudalistic way, life became tough. Subject feels that the family was
brought into more direct contact with reality and that this was not
necessarily a bad influence.
6. Subject actually did not want to leave Georgia. He felt it was
a flight rather than a tactical retreat. Apparently he has never been
able to accept this humiliating defeat and it may be that part of his
current motivation for affiliation involves his perception of an opportunity
to take countermeasures against the Soviets. He is a person who cannot
tolerate being beaten in competition.


72/
7. Subject was a non-disciplined child and was in constant rebellion
against his teathers' whom he reit did not discriminate intelligent children
or pay him sufficient individual attention. Apparently his rebellious be-
havour was his way of getting attention. He felt his teachers were too
distant and automatically unpelasant. He engaged in practical lucked but
was an activist in the school situation: As a result he was asked
of one school after another and has a history of attending 18 different
schools. The least that can be said of this strange behaviour is that he
was undisciplined and has always refused to abide by the conformist
and his school. He said.
attitude of his peers. On the contrary he has always felt compelled to
do those things not normally done by others. The 18 schools generally
speaking, represent frustration, the seeking of an aim to pursue, and the
hope that his ideal would crystallize and materialize. Subject is rather
abstract in this respect. Generally, it would seem that his ideal is
first of all material and perhaps also moral comfort and security. However,
he has always regarded his society, through his disappointments and
mortifying experiences, as & wicked and selfish in its majority. Since
he felt society was selfish and mean, he expressed his dissatisfaction
in the form of aggressive and destructive behaviour. Apparently Subject
was a precocious child and he experienced disillusionment in his family
and in society. It is as if he suddenly discovered to his great dis-
appointment that there was no Santa Claus.
8. At first Subject felt his disillusionment was unique and peculiar
to his particular life experience, but he soon discovered that his dis-
content was characteristic of others. He experienced this fighting
attitude within himself and he reflected it in his non-conforming be-
haviour.
9. His mother reacted to his behaviour with over-affectionate
solicitouness. She wasn't actually able to determine the reasons for his
internal distress, but she was aware something was taking place within him.
The mother was apparently a marked conformist who insisted that Subject
abide by the acsial order. She took him to a psychiatrist because of his
behaviour problems and because she did not advise him of what she was
doing and got him to a psychiatrist on a subterfuge, and because Subject
did not agree with the psychiatrist's conclusions, he did not benefit
by this experience. This indicates to us that in handling Subject it


/2/
would be wise not to approach his as if he were the problems, but to permit
his to maintain his posture that he is right and acceley is wrong. In
other words we must avoid doing what his mother did to him.
10. Subject has always indulged in a sort of introspection and
self-analysis, the purpose of which was to determine how to realize his
aspiratione. Another aspect of his system of ideals proceeds from the
life concept of chivalvich his feels his parents inculcated. This in-
volves the defense and the protection of the oppressed and the weak. It
is sort of a Robin Hood concept which he attributes to himself. This
chivalrous ideal is active to date. He feels that many people need help
and he has always wanted to help others in order to help himself. In other
words he is motivated to helping others in order to obtain love and
affection. This need for love and affection is probably the most primary
of his. motives.
11. In respect to the flight of the family from Georgia, Subject feels
he was too young to understand it. However, he feels he revolted against
1t. His idea is that one must fight, surpass and conquer. As a young boy
he felt he was much stronger than several million men. This is extremely
important as regards utilization of his services. First of all he is
motivated to succeed out of a spirit of revenge, and secondly he is self-
confidant and optimistic that he will succeed despite the hazards of the
undertaking. He is like a man who wants to kill an elephant -- all he
wants from us is a high-powered rifle -- then he feels he would be equal
to the elephant.
12. Subject also seems to reflect disappointment in his father as
a personal ideal. He regards his father as a very independent person,
kind but profoundly selfish, but who would nevertheless give you the
shirt off his back. His father was fond of the children, loved the whole
family and was happy when he saw others happy. However, Subject is con-
vinced that if his. father had succeeded, none of the things that happened
in his life would have come to pass. He feels that his motner's suicide
is a direct consequence of his father's failure to succeed.
13. When his father and sister returned to Georgia, Subject was driven
to despair by the breaking-up of the family. The death of his mother and
the departure of his father and sister was quite a threat to his security.


/8/
He tried to hold his father back and even threatened him that because of
a French law according to which a foreigner must pay his taxes before he
leaves the country, the father ran the risk of being arrested When he
told this to his sister, she became angry with his and replied that the
father was mature enough to act as well as possible. Subject's attempt
to prevent his father from leaving was conflictual for his because it
represented an interference with his father's desire and project. This
experience taught him that when his father had taken a decision, he would
carry it through at any cost. As it happened, the result was the dis-
integration of the family. If Subject found himself in the same
situation today, he would act in exactly the same way.
14, The father apparently returned to Georgia because he wanted to
die in Georgia. Subject feels that his father was doing something important
to realize his objectivity or to achieve his purpose. However, he feels
his father accepted defeat by returning to Georgia to die. The mother
did not go with the father and apparently was at her wits end after the
father left. Subject regards his mother as the axle of the family and
when he lost her through suicide, he feels she deserted him.
15. Subject's sister followed her father to Georgia out of a spirit
of affection and sacrifice. She felt that her father needed her and
Subject feels she was a tributary of his mistakes. The sister has a Ph.D.
in languages and taught courses in school. At the time of Stalin the
children would say "we have done this and that thanks to Stalin" and she
would reply "you are individuals and you have done this or that without
Stalin." As a result she was arrested and sent to a concentration camp.
With the change of regimes she obtained her freedom and got her Job back.
16. The sister's husband returned to Russia also and Subject believes
that because he had served in the German army he may have been sent to a
concentration camp. He feels the intellectual level of the brother-in-law
is lower than that of the sister. The brother-in-law apparently has an
inferiority complex. He emigrated to France at a much later date and
apparently could not adapt himself and regretted having left Russia.
17. Subject's brother, is an architect in Gap.
The brother is an independent person who is conservative and probably


/5/
conforming. He has not distinguished himself in any extraordinary fashion
and Subject unconsciously compares himself with his brother. It is likely
that he and his brother were rivals for the mother's affection and,
whereas Subject feels that his brother is jealous of him, it is likely
that Subject is jealous of the brother's accomplishments. He feels that
whenever he succeeds his brother is jealous. Subject is also identified
with his brother in a complex and interesting way. For example, he feels
that both he and his brother love the same type of women. He is not able
to say much about his brother except that he is kind, somewhat vain, and
that he is fond of his brother. However, it is likely that his brother
may have been indirectly instrumental in Subject's recruitment. It may
also be that his brother regards Subject as "Peck's bad boy" or the black
sheep of the family and is interested in
him as regards
accomplishment or success.
18. Subject was the baby of the family and still is. Whereas he
was born in 1918, his brother was born in 1916 and his sister in 1915.
Subject was more expressive of affection, particularly for his mother,
whereas his brother was more timid, shy, and independent. When the
brother saw Subject getting the mother's attention, he tried to replace
Subject. This sibling rivalry may continue to date, for example, the
brother learned that Subject was seeing a girl whom he knew. The brother
advised the girl to leave Subject alone.
19. Subject denies he is jealous of his brother. He admits his
brother has been successful but in his own sphere. Subject's new found
philosophy is not to accept the fact that he has been unsuccessful, but
to try to explain why he has not. In other words he seems to be motivated
to obtain greater knowledge of himself.
20. Subject does not consider himself as a Georgian; this is of no
importance to him. He regards the flight from Georgia as a defeat and as
a loss of the motherland which he has never accepted. He feels he was a
Georgian as a child but the most important aspect is that he feels he was
defeated by the necessity of the family's flight from Georgia. He offers
as an analogy the fact that he was committed to prison; this was a defeat
for him. In other words he was not bothered by the prison life but by the
fact that he made a wrong calculation in taking on a bad associate and con-


/6/
sequently being arrested and imprisoned. Therefore defeat appears to be
the first factor. in his life experience.
21. - At a certain time in his childhood Subject lived near: some
former Georgian resistants who were fighting against the Soviets. Subject
to
the
regarded these persons as uneducated but nevertheless
and
affectionate. He feels he certainly must have been influenced by the
exciting stories which they told his about their fights and many exploits.
He feels he must also have been impressed by their patriotism. He feels
they expressed themselves in a warm and enthralling manner which exalted
and deeply impressed him. He feels this particular association may account
for his passion which he always puts in the execution of whatever he
undertakes. One of the principal determinants of this man's behaviour
is apparently the very strong desire to succeed and accomplish.
22. Subject feels that throughout his school experience perhaps only
one or two professors understood him. These particular professors thought
that it was often necessary in life to "swallow" a great deal of useless
"stuff" so that thereafter certain essential problems could be more easily
digested. Subject feels that these professors were superior and that he
understood them, whereas he regarded the others as apparently idiotic
or worthless.
23. Subject was influenced by heroes whom he heard about such as
Lindbergh, Edison, Hitler, Einstein, and several others. He realized that
if such people existed, it meant that the possibility to act either for
good or for evil also existed. He did not identify with any one hero in
particular but always wished that he could have been one of them. He did
not actually want to be one of them, but wanted to resemble heroes in
general. Subject always remains- remembers certain great men mentioned
in history. He feels that these great men gave him the concept that a
certain order was necessary for the level of the people. However, it
appears he was disillusioned in these men and his ideals were shaken be-
cause he later learned to his: dismay that they could: commit abject or
monstrous acts. Subject feels he has made many mistakes in life but how-
ever big these mistakes may be, he does not feel they have reflected his
basic character. He feels that his character was basically based by the
desire to become a worthwhile individual, even at the cost of thehaving
wrongly. He feels that if the only criterion for judging a man is his


771
achievements, then he is a failure.
24. Subject feels that apart from the academic progress at school,
he learned that it was necessary to communicate, to express himself, to
understand and to explain. He feels that these are necessary for one to be
a member of society.
25. Subject feels his mother was a major influence in his life. He
is disappointed in his mother because he feels he loved her but she de-
serted his through suicide. He feels she sacrificed herself completely
for the children and that she filled herself because he no longer knew
how to distribute love and care: Subject began to lose regard for his
father from the time he realized that his father was not giving his
mother affection. However, he identifies with his father in the respect
that both never achieved anything significant and that they both may have
disappointed the mother. Subject misses his mother's love and he feels
his life was broken up when she died. He found himself completely alone
and all his illusions disappeared. He tried to find affection through
others. He feels the need for affection is a big part of himself but
on the other hand "I am a complicated person."
26. Subject claims he has learned the difference between a man and
a woman. This is likely to have a good deal of meaning to him, particularly
as regards his relationship with his mother. He regards women as logical
and to be determined by a psycho-feminine education. This is enough to
tip us off that he should not be exposed to handling by females.
27. Subject claims he has learned from his personal experience in
life rather than from the experience of others. In other words he has
educated himself in the school of life and has derived little from the
actual formal school situation. For example, he claims his mothers
opinions had importance only at the time she was rendering her opinions;
thereafter they were not influential as far as he was concerned. This
may be important as regards training. It is likely that he would prefer
to proceed with the task in actuality rather than to learn about per-
forming the task through the experiences or training of others.
28. Subject joined the French Foreign Legion at the beginning of
the war. As a foreigner and as an
he was subject to


B/
mobilization into the French army, but he felt the authoritié took an
awful long time to make a decision in connection with him. Because of
this, he joined the Foreign Legion and left: immediately for North Africa
feeling that thus He was becoming a member of a famous unit and at the
same time fulfilling his obligations toward the French military service.
In the beginning he was satisfied but later he was of the opinion that
France was an incoherent mess, and he bitterly regretted that he had
become acquainted with people who obviously did not know what they wanted
This experience did not have a great influence on his character except
that it expressed a profound dislike for irresolute persons. This in-
dicates that Subject is an impatient: fellow who desires immediate action
as regards his interest. He is impatient with postponement and unless he
is dealt with promptly, he may satisfy his interests elsewhere. However,
in the current instance he has no alternative and he is forced to go along
with normal procedures which he may regard as a waste of time, but will
accept.
29. Subject feels that he married because he regarded marriage as
necessary to build a family and to make a home. He feels his marriage was
a mistake because, even though he understands the value of the principles
involved, principles which were inculonated by his father, it is ridiculous
to marry just for the sake of principles without the necessary sentiments.
He feels that at the time he was merely abiding by precepts of his father
without thinking of the possible consequences. However he soon discovered,
in fact, a family did not represent anything at all, and that creating the
family was aggravating the incoherence and the division of society. In
view point getting married meant building a wall around himself. It also
meant that instead of finding a partner who complemented him, all that he
obtained from the partnership was a
reflection of himself.
He feels that the so-called spiritual intimacy is a fallacy. He claims
that, sexually speaking, women are necessary but he fails to say why it
is necessary to build a separate world with it.
30. As was explained above, the reason for his marriage are connected
with his family education. He does not regard his marriage as a complete
fiasco. He regards his w. fe as very nice. He thinks he was nice, too.


/9/
They got along fairly well with one another but did not live very com-
fortably. He did not feel there was any evolution in the marriage and he
admita to his debit that he married his wife because he wanted to ex-
perience what it meant to have children. Actually, however, he did not
want children. However, he assumed that the marriage would produce a
child when he had exactly imagined. In other words he wanted an exact
reproduction of himself. He obtained a daughter who was beautiful,
always laughing, but because of his separation after his arrest, he has
ignored what has happened with the child. His wife also had a second
child by Subject who was born while the was in jail and Subject knows
nothing at all about the second child. Subject set his wife in a model
makere shop and believes the liked him immediately. However, if the were
to do it again, he would not marry.
31. During the war when Subject was in Germany, he got involved in
a false documents business and created a gang which he led. The purpose
of the group was to repatriate or liberate war prisoners. The black
market was a worthless branch, technically speaking, of the organization.
Its only purpose was to solve financial problems. However, it is true that
the black market reached such a magnitude that a person who was interested
only in making money would have found it quite satisfying and sufficient
in itself. As a whole, the technical efficiency of his gang satisfied
him. They had freedom of motion and security. Subject was arrested be-
cause of a carelessness or a alip,ot in the actual functioning of the
gang, but rather on the part of one of the men whom they were helping.
32. Through this experience Subject learned that it was very inter-
esting to know the weaknesses of authorities and to play these weaknesses
or forces against one another. His emotions corresponded to a joy of
being the sole master of his actions and moves. He feels that if he were
to find himself in this sort of situation again, he would act in exactly
the same way.
33. When Subject was arrested by the Gestapo, he was considered by
the Germans to be a very important prey. He played the game and led the
Germans to believe that he was an important prey in the hope that such
belief would give him certain advantages. Although he realized he could
be shot for only one-half of what he had done and that. it was


10/
disadvantageous for him to exaggerate in order to mix the treks and com-
Tute the German authorities, this gave him a chance not to mention certain
partners who he made it appear as negligible. He continued this game
until he saw that the end was near. For example, there was a great need
of gas in Germany and he figured he could gain time by telling the Germans
he had invented a very interesting motor which they could profitably use.
The Germans took his offer into consideration and postponed his execution.
Shortly thereafter he was liberated by the Americans.
34. This vignette indicates that Subject has the developed capacity
of a can man and that he is capable of imaginatively talking himself out
of rather tight situations. This, of course, is an outstanding qualification
as regards the requirements of the project.
35. Subject attacked a bank in 1950. At the time he was married and
was the father of one child. He was working in a model makers shop and
although he was not, well off, he was earning a decent living. However,
because of his love for risk and out of friendship for another fellow, he
agreed to participate in the bank attack. Apparently the other fellow
trusted Subject because he knew of Subject's war activities and he figured
that because Subject had been able to accomplish certain illegal activities
that he was quite capable of attacking a bank. The attack was carefully
planned. Because there were only two on the team they were compelled in
view of the smallness of his staff to give extra attention to their plan.
36. According to Subject he was close to this young friend who
solicited his financial assistance. At first, Subject felt that the other
fellow was crazy to dare to attack a bank. He also had the normal twinge
of conscience and asked himself the question "is it right to do harm by
robbing a bank?" Subject never felt that the two alone would be able to
attack the bank successfully. Consequently, they determined to knock
over a Jewelry shop first. At each point in the developments Subject
wanted to withdraw from the whole deal by saying "if my mother learned of
this, she would die." They postponed the job indefinitely. However, his
mother died in the meantime and his iriend again approached him and told
him that now that his mother was dead, there was no longer such a danger.
Subsequently they knocked over the jewelry store.


/11/
37. Subject's chief motivation for such an activity appears to be
the following: (a) Friendship. Apparently Subject will do anything for
a friend. (b) Action: Apparently Subject relishes novelty and excitement
and daring-do. Apparently he is a Jease James type. (c) Emotional outlet
for success of planning. Apparently Subject indulges himself in problem-
solving and obtains a coepulsive satisfaction if his plans succeed. In
other words, he is motivated to carry out such an-action because of his
displaced interest in successfully engineering and. accomplishing a Job.
(d) Money. Subject apparently is not motivated for mater.1. reward. In
the case of the robbery his friend got 3/4 of the take and Subject got
1/4 Subject was. content not to spend his money freely because his wife
might become suspicious.
38. However, the friend returned after having spent his money.
Previously Subject had told him "you got your money for the marriage;
now leave me alone." However, the friend had not married and was now
des:rous of robbing a bank in order to finance another intended marriage.
Subject agreed that this would be the last job. They cased the joint very
carefully and then committed the act. The other fellow apparently threw
his money around, was arrested, and squealed. The police came to
Subject's place, found a
, and he was arrested, in his flight
to the Spanish border. Subject was fleeing to the Pyrenees because he
had learned that his bank deal partner had been arrested and had talked,
and that the police were after him. Subject voluntarily admits that he
loet control over himself and that he had failed to plan in case he failed
and had to flee. He had not foreseen or prepared himself fur such a con-
sequence. If he were to find himself again in the same situation, he would
prepare an escape even if it were only necessary for the satisfactory
planning of the project.
39. However, the question which arises in this examiner's mind is
why Subject panicked in his flight. It could have been that he un-
consciously wanted to get caught and to be punished in order to relieve
his guilt. If this is so, then important consideration should be given
to this aspect of Subject's personality as regards planning the project.


/12/
40. When he has jalled by the French police he was somewhat de-
pressed by the fact that he had greatly disappointed his close relatives
and because he was locked upon as a noisy and rash fellow rather than as
a man capable of carrying out a crime.
41. Subject feels he failed badly when he was arrested by the Germans
and also when he was arrested by the French. He feels these two failures
are consequences of the poor manner in which he chose his friends. He
feels it is now up to his to take all the necessary precautions in order
to avoid the same pitfalla in the future.
42. There have been times in this man's life when he felt that the
entire world seemed to: despite against his and when everything seemed to
collapse before him. Yet he has always felt there were ways to get out of
a mess principally by virtue of working. He continues to believe that
unless a man is so weak both physically and morally, it is always possible
for him to get back on his feet or at least to hope that this is possible.
Consequently, even when he was broke, Subject always believed there was a
possibility to fight and conquer. It is likely he will always have hope
and optimism.
43. As regards his philosophy on the two projects which involved
liberating French prisoners and the bank attack, he was betrayed by
another. Actually, however, he could not have become angry at these
persons because he felt his betrayal was unimportant. However, these
persons lost his esteem because he feels there are certain moral values
which he holds clearly, namely friendship. This would indicate that he is
more in contempt of himself for having miscalculated than angry with the
other person for having betrayed him. However, Subject does not feel that
any of his mistakes, regardless of their size and consequence, have serious
consequences as regards his near or distant future. There is no question
that his mistakes have seriously reduced his circumstances of life, but he
is optimistic and it is likely he regards this assignment as a golden
opportunity which not only permits him a chance of success, but does not
censure him for his past deeds. Consequently, he feels that to be dis
couraged about the future is nonsense for if there is a future, there is
hope.


/13/
48. Although Subject has seen many things in his life and has had
many opportunities to become angry, he feels he has never completely lost
self control. He feels he has always been the master of his actions at
all times and that these actions could have been changed by his own volition.
45 If Subject has ever been ashamed of himself, it must have been
when his behaviour was wrongly interpreted by persons whom he loved or who
loved him.
46. Subject tends to become embarrassed and confused when certain
persons who ask or accept something from him display too much gratitude,
In other words, too large a dose of affection will unseat Subject despite
the fact that he continually solicits affection.
47. Subject has continually deceived and disappointed his mother
because every time she started his in a new school, she made him precise
he would behave nicely, but each time he was thrown out of school. He is
convinced sho wanted this for his good and not for the satisfaction of
having a perfect child. However, it is likely that the mother's over-
solicitousness was actually compensatory for her basic rejection of
Subject. Therefore, she wanted him to be perfect so that she could love
him. Consequently, it is likely that she did things for him, but she did
things with him for herself. In other words, she wanted him to be perfect
so that he could be worthy of her love. He was not perfect, probably did
not obtain her love, and consequently is continually seeking the love of
other persons. However, he cannot accept this fact as regards his mother
and denies she did not act in his interest. One of his chief defenses is
denial, that is, simply assuming the attitude that such and such was not
true when he probably believes it was true.
48. Subject's actions are often 'impulsive and unreasoned. Such
irrational behaviour usually takes place with another person despite the
fact that there may be no particular tie or affection between him and the
other person. Subject is unable to explain why this is so and intellectually
realizes that any explanations which ne might offer are not sufficient
to explain such behaviour and his emotional state. In other words, this
man's impulsiveness and tendence to behave irrationally and to his own
disadvantage and in his own disinterest amounts to a compulsion which is
sufficient to determine his behaviour but which is unconscious and not


/14/
available to rational analysis, or even awareness. In this respect he is
propelled by an uncontrollable force. This is an important point of
consideration as regards his utilization in this project.
49. Subject's left index finger and thumb are missing. He lost
these in an explosion. This occurred in Germany when he was. involved in
the repatriation deal. After the bombing of Berlin he picked up among
the ruins an unexploded bomb or British origin and took it home to
salvage the explosive which he might use. in various ways: While he was
resolving the detonator wh. ch. was probably stuck in its receptacle, the
detonator exploded in his fingers. Subject does not regret the fact that
he tried to dismantie the bomb because he feels he has learned that one
should keep his hands away from certain things. The explosion occurred
so quickly that there was no immediate pain but the people around his be-
came panicky. He remained cold blooded and gave the order to remove all
things which were there because the explosion undoubtedly alerted the
police. The police came and he explained that he had played with a
fountain pen which had burst. The policemen strongly advised him never
again to pick up objects dropped by the enemy. They took cognizance of
his declarations and went away. The Red Cross took care of his wounds.
50. Subject does not think he will be very different in the future
from what he is now. However, he feels his material situation will have
improved. He does not mean financially but socially. He naively hopes
that the workd w 11 change and there will be no discrimination. He also
hopes to acquire, if necessary, a nationality in which case he will feel
he actually belongs to society. However, he feels that society is
anxious to stamp and label individuals and it may be that he would prefer
to be an individualist who is outside of society than to be a member of
society who is required to conform. Since this person lives in the
present. It is very difficult for him to imagine what his future will be.
51. Despite the fact that this man is motivated by rather vivid
ideals, he still strikes the examiner as a practical realist who thinks
and acts in a matter of fact manner. He has experienced a good deal of
life and he is quite sophisticated.


15/
52. Subject reels that a friend would regard him as unsitable,
affectionate, and a day drenner.
53. Subject feels that a critic would say of him that the majority
of his commercial undertakings have brought results which are considerably
lower than hoped for Consequently he feels he is either an. optimist
or a 'joker, or else his views on the possibilities of accomplishing
things are not very healthy.
54. In His defense be emphasizes that in his opinion the value of an
achievement does not consist of its spectacular magnitude or in its
multiplicity. For example, he feels it is not necessary to say 'good
morning" 100 times in order to understand the meaning and purpose of
"good morning." Also he does not feel it is necessary to mass produce
a machine in order to fully understand its function. However, he realizes
that, commercially speaking, it is more rational to mass produce the
machine but the repitition does not interest him. In his opinion the
creative idea and the prototype have a much greater value and importance
than the setting up of the factory which will popularize the prototype.
To illustrate his feeling further he is of the opinion that one single
thought from a great thinker appears to him to be much more valuable
than the millions of books which are published yearly.
55. In describing himself Subject reveals that he always tries his
hardest to keep his promises. He also feels that he sometimes appears to
talk somewhat rashly but he feels this is due to the fact that he thinks
fast and he is able to seg quickly the components and the essence of a
problem in its various prospectives. He is able to rapidly synthesize.
In other words he learns extremely fast and he gets the point immediately.
He is so quick that he will understand what you are trying to say before
you finish the sentence.
56. Subject is unable to see himself in terms of what he would like
to be. In order for him to display himself, it would be necessary that he
would be another person altcgether. However, he feels that, everything
relative, pertiaps he should show more'strength of character, be a little
more compromising, more realistic, and less sentimental. However, this
would imply that he would then find himself in an environment in which
there was no room for sentiment -- in which case his personality would


167
out of place.
57. It is Subject's experience that his friends love him for what
he is. He likes his friends as they are, probably because they are as
they are. The 'idea of attempting to change a friend is unthinkable for
him. He loves them for their bad points as well as their good points.
58. Subject is an optimist but also a pessimist. He feels he will
never be able to reach his ideals because his material ideal (social
reform) is so distant that he would need to lead many
in
order to attain it. It might be unfair to call this man a pessimist;
it is more likely he is a realist and perhaps a cynic.
59. This man denies that he has any interest or emotional
attachment to France at this time. However, it is likely he was patriotic
at the time of the war. Since he has been branded a criminal and has
been deprived of certain rights and privileges, he now perhaps feels re-
jected and in turn is rejecting France as his fatherland. Nevertheless,
he strikes the examiner as a true Frenchman -- he thinks and feels like a
Frenchman and is certainly not a Russian in his personality. It is likely
that he identifies the French authorities with the police. He cannot
tolerate rejecting attitudes. He is like an outsider who is loa'ing in.
It may be he has the "sour grapes" attitude by which he feels that since
he cannot have what he wants, it is not too good anyway.
60. Subject is not a planner. Despite his interest in invention
and the fact that he has pulled off a number of capers, he is more of an
instigator, a leader, and an executor. In order for him to be successful
in future projects, it is necessary that someone else plan and then tell
him exactly what to do.
61. Subject is currently involved in the invention business which
he started alone. He is the owner and exploiter of several patents and
certain persons are financially and technically interested in his in-
ventions. He is faced with a problem at this time. He is involved in
the initial and preliminary phases with us and consequently is put on
the fence as regards his invention business. Furthermore, if he were to
join us, he would relinquish everything to his business partners.


/17/
62. This person will open himself up readily to an open personality.
He will be secretive with an inhibited or secretive personality. Com-
sequently, the best person to work with this individual is a direct,
expressive and visible personality.
63. This person's social drives seem to involve: (a) General im-
provement of living conditions for everybody; in other words he is a
humanitarian. He is not necessarily an activistic social reformer.
(b) Improvement of his own standard of living. He has an inclination
to better things and he feels this is the disease of all inventora.
68. Subject expressen himself freely, is discursive, voluble; and
is able to carry on a conversation indefinitely. This is typically French
but, in particular, it represents an oral characteristic. In other words,
he is all mouth. He both expresses himself orally and he is driven by
desire to obtain oral supplies by incorporation. What this means is that
he will eat you up.
65. Subject reflects superior intelligence, is capable of abstract
conceptualization, and is able to deal in symbols.
66. Subject is a narcissistic character who feels that because others
don't love him, he needs to love himself. In other words, he is quite in
love with himself and acts accordingly.
67. Subject tends to rationalize and to offer socially acceptable
reasons for his individualistic behavior.
68. Subject strives chiefly for emotional satisfaction.
69. Subject is all altruistic but at the same time he is selfish. He
will do things for the community with the hope of getting something out of
it for himself. Both of these drives merge in a unitary fashion. He is
motivated by both at the same time.
70. Subject denies nationalistic motives for his actions and prefers
to regard them as being primarily humanitarian. Subject is action-oriented
and loves to take risk and gets a kick out of excitement and adventure.


/18/
71. Subject acts because the thinks he is right.
72. Subject acts because he thinks he will succeed and because he
regards what he undertakes as important. He is egotistical in this regard.
73. Subject needs to prove to others that he is successful. He is
self confident in his prowess but is increase that others may not regard
him as adequate as he feels he is.
74. It is interesting to note that Subject participated in the
release of the 13 French prisoners not out of patriotic motives, but to
satisfy his taste for action. If they were German prisoners, he would
have done the same thing. Actually, Subject admired the German army, had
sympathy for Germans, but did not wish the French to be harmed. This is
quite paradoxical but understandable in terms of the Subject's personality.
His emotionalized ideals are not defined in terms of politics or
nationalities, but are determined by a vague desire to help others who
need it. This combination can mislead him and get him into difficulty;
for example, his accomplice in the bank robbery.
75. Subject is a rank individualist. He is a non-conformist.
However, he realizes he must cope with the community, must sacrifice for
the
of the community, and must not harm others. In this
regard it is unlikely that Subject has ever committed physical assault,
nor is it likely that he would in the future. No matter what the other
person is or represents to Subject, he is still a human being whom
Subject respects.
76. Although Subject is basically an exhibitionist, he is not
inclined to bragging or to exhibit himself in a transparent or patent
fashion. He is too sophisticated. However, he needs attention and is
likely to do things in order to get attention. This is what he did in
18 schools.
77. As was previously mentioned, Subject helped French prisoners
get back to France during the war. He thought it was the right thing to
do but did not do it Just for France. He was paid for it but he gave
his money to help the prisoners. In terms of his hierarchy of motives,
it is likely that this person acts according to what he considerg to be
right. He also expresses self pride in doing the outstanding, the difficult,


/19/
and for which he is not necessarily being paid. He acts out of principle,
with no special reason. He helped the French prisoners despite the fact
that he had sympathy for the Germans. However, his sympathy for the
Germans was based on the fact that some Georgians had relatives in Germany
and he preferred that the Germans would defeat the Russians.
78. Another reason he helped the French prisoners was that he felt
that they were suffering and because they were suffering, he wanted to
relieve them by helping them return to their country. Thus he was best
on murturance. He always stands ready to help someone who is in need.
79. Subject's motivation for affiliation is positive, spontaneous,
voluntary, and intense. He likes the Americans but finds it a bit difficult
to analyze this sentiment. He feels the Americans have made certain
political mistakes but they reflected a fundamental and basic sincerity
which he likes. He understands the United States has political interest
but he is willing to go along out of admiration for the sincerity of the
Americans. He is not looking for special compensation. Generally, he is
quite willing to do what is asked without rational reasens. In other
words, his motivation is typically emotional and is understandable in
terms of his character organization. He feels that a person is capable
of doing anything for love of nothing. He is inclined to put things on a
personal basis. He doesn't belong to any community. He feels his early
years in Georgia have had no effect on his way of thinking or on his way
of perceiving life. He likes the liberty which exists in America and the
fact that people are treated as individuals rather than as numbers.
80. Subject's actives are genuine and are compatible with his
outlook on life. They are not necessarily original or sophisticated but
they are personal and therefore bona fide. Furthermore, Subject is really
on the shelf in gap. He is controlled in his movements and is restricted
in his aspirations and consequently is unable to realize his freedom and
to develop himself as an individual. Consequently, the assignment
represents a unique opportunity for him to rise above his present re-
stricted level of existence.
81. Subject is a very sensitive person and he attaches great im-
portance to events of life.


140
/20/
82. Another important characteristic is his curiosity and his interest
for
83. Another interesting proclivity is Subject's tendency to assume
blame for the mistakes of others even when he is not necessarily guilty.
As a child he was gifted but undisciplined and an unsuitable student
who couldn't concentrate and adapt to the school situation As a result
he was always in trouble but, more interestingly, he was always glad to
assume responsibility for the anti-social actions of others. Whether
be did this for masochiatic reasons or because he wanted to obtain the
approval of others for whom he sacrificed is difficult to determine.
What is true, however, is that he will submit himself for punishment
even though he has not done wrong. He may do this out of friendship
in order to have others feel greatful to him. He has the attitude he
should be punished for doing wrong, but should not be degraded for doing
right. Subject has always realized that he has needed help as regards
his emotional problems. He likes to be helped materially, not as and it-
self, (?) but because material help involves the implication of moral
help. For example, a dentist in Gap offered to help Subject in his in-
ventions without asking for advantages. This means a lot to Subject. He
attaches small importance to money and he derives a tremendous satisfaction
out of helping others or being helped.
84. Subject reflects a tremendous vitality that has, in the past,
expressed itself through false attempts such as the bank robbery, etc.
He feels he is not being used as he should and that there is a power
within himself, a creative urge of movement, a power of realization.
It is highly emotionally charged and he feels he is capable of doing much
more than he has in the past. Although he feels he is a complicated
person, he does not feel he is difficult to understand.
85. Subject likes to act intelligently and sensibly. He strives
for efficiency. For example, haxixxx if a person were to ask him to open
a window, he feels it is up to him to decide as regards the proper method.
The efficiency plus the results are his rewards. Consequently, he likes
practical work which involves an intellectual effort.


140000
/21/
86. Subject has a highly developed verbal intelligence and he is
able to amplify and elaborate on his ideas.
87. prior to the last session on the 10th of January Subject was
routinely contacted by the French police who were investigating his
activities in Paris at this time. As a result of this contact, he was
markedly apprehensive and pre-occupied with the seriousness of this visit
by the police and was not able to freely devote himself to psychological
analysis as heretofore. The important point here is that Subject is an
extremely alert and vigilant person. His primary motive is, of course,
self-preservation and he is likely to over-react and to become emotionally
upset with provocation. He needs the guiding influence of a more mature
and experienced person who is in control of the situation.
88. Another important aspect of his relationship with us appears to
be the fact that he consciously or unconsciously feels he has "arrived"
and in acceptable to us. In other words he feels that perhaps a decision
has been made which is in his favor. This reflects his own desire to be
accepted together with his estimation of the situation.
89. This individual, despite his past exploits, is not necessarily
a hostile person. In other words he will not do harm nor will he hurt
others who are weaker than himself. He will act out of exigency but he
will deliberately avoid being sadistic or wantonly cruel.
90. For some reason Subject exhibits a marked degree of loneliness
and isolation at this time. He seems to be seeking companionship.
91. Subject prefers to work alone as regards technical research, but
as regards the execution of an operation he prefers to be with someone or
part of an organization. He knows he can rely upon himself when he is
alone and that others had been unreliable in his past. However, if it is
necessary for him to work with two or more individuals, he will accept it.
92. Subject admits of physical inferiority feelings by virtue of his
size and strength but he denies he has feelings of intellectual inferiority.
He depends more upon his mental faculties than upon his physical. "I have
no fear of an elephant if I have a gun."


/22/
93. Subject is a stubborn fellow who does not like to be defeated
and he strives to conquer.
94. Subject always looks for causes. He is no magical thinker but
tends to be rational and realistic despite his strong emotional re-activity
which can be almost explosive at times.
95. Subject particularly strives not to be regarded as bad or evil.
In fact, he is not a criminal type but is a neurotic character who has
expressed his conflicts and difficulties in non-conforming behaviour.
At the same time he is not anti-social. He is a person who has
differences of opinion and conflicts with the social order.
96. Subject does not regard himself as an expert or
He realizes his short comings and he hopes his
will be
complemented by training.
97. Subject relies quite heavily upon humor for relief of tension
and as a defense against the development of anxiety and inter-personal
relationships.
98. An important aspect of this man's personality and history would
appear to be his so-called accident proneness. He is like the cat in the
Disney film who, while chasing the mouse and having his entire attention
directed to the catching and incorporation of the mouse, inadvertently
gets himself run over by a truck. His first reaction to being splattered
by the truck is one of disappointment as regards not arriving at the goal;
i.e., catching the mouse. He thereupon acts upon feelings of revenge on
the mouse for having caused his unfortunate accident. In addition, this
example signifies that Subject is likely to keep his eye too much upon the
goal and insufficiently upon the hazards involved in reaching the goal. It
may be argued that Subject's philosophy in his past operations are related
in some manner to his lack of attention to such details. His history is
that of the unlucky cat who manages to get himself run over successfully.
99. This person can be quite discompesed by the surprise of un-
expected occurrences.
100. Despite defeat Subject is able to pick himself up, figure things
out, start all over in a more systematic way, and continue in his pursuit
of his goal. Consequently, he does learn by experience. His mistakes are


123/
chiefly due to the fact that he is or has been "stupid" or implausible
stupid, impulsive, immature and inexperienced.
101: Subject is capable of experiencing melancholy or depressive
mood swings. However, he maintain a gay-facade and he attempts to
relieve his depressive feelings with lightness. Undemneth the gay
appearance, however, is seriousness. One of the chief motives is his
curiousity. He seeks the unknown but when he approaches the unknown, he
experiences a certain feeling which he recognizes as a threat to his
emotional security and he is ambivalent about proceeding or withdrawing.
He has an internal fear of something which he doesn't know or understand.
Because of this it may be necessary to provide him with firm support,
guidance, and consideration of all the possible eventualities. He has a
fear of getting himself into something which he cannot get out of and his
immediate reaction is to turn around and go away without having solved
the problem. Consequently, he needs a person of greater intelligence who
is able to help him to evaluate the realities of his situation or
predicament. It must be kept in mind that his self-preservation is
stronger than his desire to solve problems.
102. Subject is likely to be loyal to a superior and may even be
critical of himself in relation to the superior. In other words, he would
like to be as useful as possible in order to express his loyalty, but may
feel inadequate in that he requirez the protection of his superior.
103. This person puts no stock in emblems or signs of rank or
reputation. He regards such signs as identifying labels only and is not
impressed or motivated for glory symbols. If he were to accomplish an
outstanding feat, he would not want a medal -- all he would want was a
remark from an important figure to the effect "well done, thank you."
He feels it is sufficient only for him to know he has done well.
104. Subject will attempt to assume leadership on the team but
it may be that if his partner is superior, he would be a better follower
than he would be a leader of a less adequate person. He is more of a
dependent than independent person in terms of his inter-personal relation-
ships; furthermore, he acts on sentiment and impulse and consequently
his judgment is questionable. This would indicate that he would work
better with a more sober-minded, calculating individual. He is likely


/24/
to work beat with a person whom he respects and with whom he enjoys a
friendly but authoritative relationship.
105. There is no reason why this person cannot be handled by an
experienced, mature case officer.
106. In view of the supposed length of the mission, it is likely
that a short term operation would be more compatible with Subject's assets
and liabilities than a long term affair.
107. As regardn the requirements of the project, it is understood
that the more desirable qualifications would reflect intelligence; re-
sourcefulness, mechanical talent; small man tams ability, infiltration
exfiltration capability; good health, physical stamina, and motivation
Subject satisfies all these criteria. The other factors which he exhibits
do not necessarily vitiate his positive features.

TSD/TRATING EVALUATION
NAME
WIRQUE
DIVISION
AF/M/1
SUBJECT
Tutorial seert Writing
DATES TRAINED 2-4 November 1960
1. During the three-day period WIRQUE received some six hours training
in the operational usage of Secret Writing, covering the opcifics of his
one-comments of the two SW egovens assigned for his operation. The
interaction was given in an AP afebouse and was presented entirely in
Naglin, 1960.
2. In ecocumone with his own requirements the agent was given a
briefing in the principles and practice of SW as a clancertine means of
communication in covert operations plans at this writing envisage the use
of SW only for emergency como. It was repeatedly emphasized that the
success of an SW letter depends 50% upon the unobtrusive "normalcy" of the
open text and 50% upon the preparation of the 84 text itself.
3. Terminal Fevaluation
a. WIRQUEa commutnted that he could adequately prepare letters
bearing a carbon-type secret ink which would meet operational require-
ments. He is a very meticulum worker and possesses a high degree of
manual detectery--medictrously, yet:
b. La quite adequately mastered the development procedures for his
assigned receiving system.
4. The agent's training opcoifically covered the following:
a. Writing techniques with a carbon-type ink
b. Scarch development of SW
c. Standard defense measures for carbon-ink writing
d. Use of glancing light in defensive and offosive examination
for SW
e. Relative placements of the SW and overt texts on the lettersheet
f. Discussion of cover letters and indicators.

5. The operational supplies passed to the Instructor by SAB were issued
to WINDOUE at the completion of the training.
C1/CE Reflections:
1. WITHOUT in the opening phases of the instrutation indicated (from a
sense of indecety, I preseme) that he was completely unfrailiar with S3.
During training cessions the caliber of his questione, observatios and even
of some of the steps in S4. technique which be independently suggested for
use all analytically indicated to the writer that he was quite fullfilar and/or
sensitent experienced in S4 practices.

e. Doteentrution proredt with everything cover stary
to show that 110000/1 is an /ustrin and who has never had OTOKE

4. It is planned at this time to take
There he will be met by the undieripend, given his Austrian documenttion,
contact instructions and letter of credit, striped of any FIFIRG clothing
or personal efforts, and digitalbed. It is not a very good way to
be the most important of the new cover assignment for subject is
temporarily left oran, etchurh he has been told to look into the projects
of opening a pboto or resear) repair above. He has actually done photomeptie
work but the decision on this we will leves to your on-the-spot. Jugment. The
protection of the procecture of the procecture of the procecture of the
regrate. There will also be a reserve of one thousand dollers in a Swiss
account should expesines necessité a greater cufury. This money will emati-
tute an anem-intorant bearing, operational: loen which must be reseid by
from profits over a period of years. All other profits after to loan in paid
off vill be 110000/1's.
5. A word about the manner of an with won we are dealing. He is a
caml, energetic individual, who has displayed broadness, emning, incomity
and the most important a particular trus of mind which lenia itself reartar-
bly to mafarium and extra-flegal activities. Excitement and intrigue are
important factors in his life, ho relishes it and as a result may be a little
dollance to handle. WECUCLY 1 likes order and clear cut chain of
the procecture of the procecture of the procecture of the procecture of
may disarreo. It is irportent to his to have the trust and unconfidence of his
case officer. If in his own ind he foela assural of this and is confident
of the professional FUTCUL-tyo conetumce of the co, ho will reci:roente in
kind. He is a very good way to be the most important. He is a very good way
to assist in disement which may be carefully wrong in the cyco of the world, but
necessary because his caco officer orderal his to carry it out, then it is
riffnt and he will dutifully umtertie appropriate action for its execution
without pages of conscience. In a word, he can retimalise all actions. One
last thought which may to usefull. Bent remulte will probably be crotten it,?
when given an assignment, he bo peraitled to accomplish it in his own way.
The latter is commotical with his idea of trust and confidance.

member of a REDSOX team. This project was postponed for a year. In
the interim he was assigned to ESD, where he was employed at a covert
site, involving the cataloguing of specific information from East
German Documents, and developing and/or improving tools and methods for
the development of 17 June 1980, it was decided that Project ASSENTIENL
would not be carried out in the 1980s. The report was signed to the
deavored to place subject elsewhere, where his training would be bene-
ficial. The African Division expressed interest and had agreed to uti-
lize: him as a result of assessments. During the period from the 2lst
of October until dispatch, subject will be carried on 00A funds.
2. Security Flaps -
A. During the latter part of WW II. subject was arrested by the Ger-
man police for forgery. He was not unduly held by the criminal investi-
gation branch of the police but passed on to the Gestapo. Subject was
brought to Berlin where he was interrogated for several months at
Gestapo Headquarters. later he was tried and sentenced to death. For
the 1980s, he was arrested in the 1980s. He was arrested to
concentration camp. While in prison he resorted to a "ruse de guerre"
and told the Germans his father had invented a motor that could run
without gasoline. He offered to draw the designs of the motor and was
able to stall long enough to be liberated by components of the advan-
cing U.S. Army.
B. In 1946-47 subject and an accomplice committed two robberies of
Jewelry stores.
C. In 1949 subject robbed a bank of 1,000,000 Pr. fr. His accomplice
was apprehended and shortly thereafter confessed, implicating subject.
Subject was apprehended while attempting to cross the Franco-Spanish
border. He was sentenced to ten years in prison of which he served
only five, receiving parole for good behavior. Upon release in 1955, he
was exiled on parole to Gap, France where he worked as an architect.
D. To our knowledge thereis no indication that subject is known to
be associated with KUBARK.

Subject does not know that he is working for KUBARK. He knows that
he is connected with some intelligence organisation, e.g., ODFEX. He
does not know anything about KUBARK organisation nor its modus oper-
and.
4. Security of meeting sites, communications, etc:
These will have to be worked out in the field by subject's case of
fier. In general, it is proposed to have him be surfaced in Germany
as an Austrian accent where, making his own way to Leopoldville.
There he is to establish a new way to develop, This would pro-
vide a natural reason for his co. or anyone to visit the office. It is vague
of overt business. Longer meetings would be held clandestinely as
determined by his co. All communication channels will have to be worked
out in the field. However until contact is established, a secure emer-
gency' channel with Headquarters is being established. This channel is
do be based only in the event subject finds himself stranded or for
the energy.
5. Security:
The agent is very security conscious and will follow any direction
in the interest of security
6. Control:
On this point here are several aspects for consideration. He is
under contract to us and although he is not too interested in money, he
does enjoy its benefits and realizes that it will continue so long as
he does a good Job. The more important built in control is the fact
that he will be under false documents, and being stateless, he is com-
fortly dependent on KUBARK to perpetuate his quasi legal existence and
to use the same case, his statue. Added to this is the control which
stems from the progress of resettlement in another country. This would
give him status as a city. He is explaining these points, subject is more
than willing to play ball with.
7. Prior contacts with any security service:
As stated in 3B (2) above, the only brush subject has had in the
past, was with Gestapo and French police. These were prior to his re-
curitement by KUBARK and were not as a result of I.S. activity.
8. Training of agent:
He had received training in covert black border operations. In ad-
dition, he is being trained in small arms and demolition.
9. Cover effectiveness and the operation of the cover facility:
Subject will open a small photo or repair shop, which will give him

a degree of latitude in movement and a cover for covert contact.
Subject has undergone plastic surgery in order to change his appearance,
also a toque was made to further assist in the changing of his outward
appearance. This action was designed to preclude any possibility of
recognition by former French associates, particularly since he is to
pass as an Austrian. The cover facility, as stated, will offer access
and legal cases of people; it will provide a natural means for contact,
and
vol. 1. The work of the American Medical Association and Business tra-
diction (including) will be resulted in very interesting business. The
researchers' knowledge techniques will help facility state his opening an
establishment. VINCIEN/1 will need capital to share if himself up, buy
needed supplies and have's working funds. For the first time, the
him with funds to establish and open this cover business, we will ad-
vance him $1000.00 as an operationol loan, to be secured with a non-
interest bearing proissary note. An additional $1000.00 will be held
in reserve, should he need more money. Ostensibly it will represent
his own savings, and will be deposited in a Swiss bank. Provision will
be made to PAY 1000.00 to back from his profits. After the loan is
paid, the credit is not very much less than the credit.
He will initially transfer $1000.00 to a bank in Leopoldville. We
are certain that he will not abscond with the funds, since his docu-
mentation will be false and his pay and allowances total $5000 per
annum, he would therefore stand to lose a great deal more than he would
gain.
Being a contract agent, there is ample control if he shows signs of
spending too much time in the pursuit of profits from his cover business.
His salary and allowances will be paid in part to a personal account
in Switzerland (separate from his business account). This money will
ostensibly also represent his savings. The remainder will be paid
directly at the station.
C. Security Estimate:
WIRGQUE had been recruited in France and exfiltrated black from West
Germany to SR/005. He has had no known I.S. connections in the past. He
will be surfaced in West Germany and will proceed to Leopoldville. He
will be documented as an Austrian.
4. Background
The need for various technicians to stabilize the chaotic conditions in
Leopoldville coupled with an urgent need for controlled assets in that city gave
rise to this project. WIRGQUE's particular talents, experience, ability and
training open up a wide variety of possibilities.

In all present and anticipated conditions with the exception of a hot war, the

been given to agent for direct communication with Headquarters.

8. Timetable:
his covert training will be completed by 15 November 1960. He will be
briefed on his cover story, documents, contact instructions, etc., 15-18 Novem-
ber 1960. On/about 18-20 November he will be flown black to West Germany.
There he will spend 5 to 7 days to familiarize himself with Germany, receive
his final briefing and obtain a visa, then depart for Leopoldville arriving 9/
1 December in Leopoldville. Once where he will require 1-2 months to look over
the business possibilities and establish himself.

There will be a need for WTRGUE to establish and live his cover. This is
anticipated to take several months. Hence he will become operational in early
1961. However, it is reasonable to expect that the station will undoubtedly
place him in covert role much sooner. Nonetheless, we do not anticipate any FI
take prior to 'ind 1961.
6. Coordination
coordination at Headquarters is being effected with FI Staff, Finance Divi-
sion and SSA/DIS.

FISCAL ANNEX
Project WIRAGUE-LUAE
Burroce: The objective of this project is to provide a long term, deep cover
asset, a contract agent, WIROGU/1, in the Republic of Congo and adjacent areas in
order to build a covert act in support of operational activities and to provide
a new ability to limit supply port for UKARK personnel under official cover. For cover
purposes, WIROGUE/1 will establish his own business, a small photo or repair shop,
which will give him a degree of latitude in movement and a cover for covert contact.
To assist WIROGU/1 in establishing his business WUARK will loan
him up to $5,000-on his personal notes, non-interest bearing and due on demand.
The initial loan vill be in the amount of $4,000. An additional $1,000 loan will
be made when, in the opinion of the Chief, Africa Division, it is required and
necessary for the business to continue and operate.
Funding: Up to $5,000 in U.S. currency or the equivalent in foreign curera-
cies may be advanced to WIROGUE/1 as loans. The loaned funds will be passed to
WIRIGUE/1 in a manner agreeable to Chief, Africa Division and Chief, Finance Divi-
sion. All funds loaned to WIROGUE/1 will be secured by U.S. dollar, non-interest
agreement, and a cover for bearer on demand. Such notes will be prepared by or ap-
proved by the Office of General Counsel. It is anticipated that an initial $4,000
will be deposited in a Swiss bank, ostensibly representing his own savings, by
KUARK, Monetary Branch.
Accounting and Write-off: WIROGUE/1 will be required to sign receipts for
all funds loaned to him. Finance Division is authorized to accept these receipts
as a charge to expense and to set up the loans payable in a memorandum account
without a due date. The notes signed by WIROGUE/1 shall be transmitted to Finance
Division, and the Finance Division, and the Finance Division, and the Finance
fite. WIROGUE/1 will be required to submit quarterly income and expense statements
on his cover business and also copies of all tax returns filed in connection with
his cover business. A copy of all income and expense statements and tax returns
will be forwarded to Finance Division. It shall be the responsibility of the Chief,
Africa Division to determine when profits warrant payments on the leans and to ef-
fect such repayments.
For purposes of control and collection, WIROGU/1 will be required
to sign blank checks on his Swiss and African business bank accounts.

FROM: Chief of Base, Sio Paulo
12 October 1960
SUBJECT: Operations/REW/ODD/AMACKE
NO INDEXING REQUIRED
Accommodation Address
ACTION REQUIRED: As requested in para. 1
REPERENCE: HAPV-2021
1. In accordance with instructions contained in reference, the Base has been
servicing the accommodation address at least one a. veek through the services of
ALLOVERTER-2 who rented this post office box under an alias. On 7 October 1960
the Base forvarded a letter which ALLOMETER-2 had picked up the day before.
This letter was registered, and ALLOMETER-2 was obliged (for the second time
of the 10th day before the 10th day before the 10th day on the ends and to sign (in alias)
an acknowledgment of receipt. If it is at all possible, the Base has been
unregistered the Base would: mich prefer that this system be adopted. ALLOMETER-2,
over a period of years, has rented many different post office boxes under different
nasse, and the Base considera it a definite security hazard if he is forced to
identify himself in the manner required by the registration of these letters.
2. Headquarters attention is called to the fact that the letter which the Base
forwarded on 7 October 1960 was postmarked in Europe on 12 August 1960. Even in
the case of the 10th day, also Krasillian portal system, the Base cannot explain
such a long delay in transit. The Base has received in this past six months. The Base has
almost every letter the Base has received in this past six months. The Base has
no reason to dibelieve ALLOMETER-2 in his repeated assumptions that he services
the box at least once a week.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Mexican Resettlement Arrangements for ASENTINEL
agent AESPIC
1. At 1400 hours, 19 August, SR/DOB case officer;
Fred Kirkpatrick and Jerry Pochron from Defection Coordinators
Office of CIA met with Clay Calendar and Jim Myers of TSD/IB
re-documentations arrangements and travel routing for possible
resettlement of ASENTINEL agent AESPIC. The following
approach is to determine whether the U.S. Government
for SR/DOB's consideration. TSD/IB suggested that Subject be
sent by black flight from here to West Germany, and there
surfaced with an altered Greek passport which TSD/IB now has
available. A suitable cover story would of course be incorporated
by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government has been
has no Greek language capability. Since this passport is a valid
one, (and was, in fact, purchased by TSD/IB) and is therefore
backstopped in name, Subject could apply at the Mexican Embassy
in West Germany for a Mexican tourist visa by presenting this
passport. Once in Mexico, Subject could request emigration
and upon declaration of intent to become a Mexican citizen and
upon immunity, the U.S. Government is happy when Mexico
City.
Upon your motion, the U.S. Government can engage for
Mr. Kirkpatrick to meet with Mr. Coulidge, the CIA contact used
for introducing agency designees into Mexican private industry.
Mr. Pochron has already talked with Mr. Coolidge on two occasions
and has passed him Subject's file. From their talks, Mr. Pochron
has assured me that this arrangement is entirely feeble, Gillete
Company of Mexico City being cited as one possibility.
3. AESPIC would then openly proceed to purchase plane
tickets in West Germany for Mexico City and upon arrival there,
would be waiting for him. The time table for this entire operation
was estimated at about five weeks. Of course we did not discuss
Subject's monetary maintenance for the interim period of travel,
nor until Subject could begin earning his own living.

of Mr. Pochron expressed his concern and the concern
of Mr. Pochron of Alien Affairs Staff about the knowledgibility
of Subject re pass Agency tie-in and Agency assets. It will of
course be our job to be able to obtain that Subject is not knowledgeable
and will entail a minimum of risk to that subject.
Mexico. In view of this concern; all arrangements offered for
DOB's consideration by TSD/IB were tailored to afford step by
the Department of the Union by the U. S. Government. In effect,
all items procured by Section 1001, the United States
easily be obtained on the European black market as well as from
this Government. Subject will in effect be briefed and taken by
German Station asset to obtain his documents ostensibly on the
United States. The United States subject would be withheld pending
destination arrival. The United States has been a sponsorship
documents to be used by him for ultimate employment. Mexico
would be prepared in such a manner, as to be either legitimate or
forged. In addition it was suggested that Subject be closely
handled and advised by someone known to him to ensure the
security aspect both to Subject and to this agency.
The meeting was closed by TSD/IB's request to be
informed which the United States in theory meet with the
approval of SR/DOB, and Office of Science, Kirkpatrick
was assured that Documentation aspects by TSD/IB could be
accomplished within one week upon authorization by SR/DOB.
With your permission Fred Kirkpatrick will proceed to affirm
Mexican employment arrangements for AESPIC.

he lived with his parents until 1921. Subject at that time moved to France
with his parents. Subject grew up in France and therefore speaks native
French (Parisian). Subject does not have French citizenship, however, and
must be classed as stateless. Subject earned the first part of his baccalaureat
at Breguet (electro-engineering), then entered the Foreign Legion at the
beginning of WIII. Subject fought in N. Africa until French cantitulation in
1940, at which time he was discharged to return home to Paris. In 1943 he wont
to Germany as a voluntary workor. Ho worked there primarily as an industrial
electrician. While in Germany he assisted French officer P.O.W.'s to escape,
aiding them with cleverly falsified papers, stems, cachots and even uniforms.
It is interesting to note that while subject attended school at Breguet, he
also attended the Technicum for Cinema topography. It was from these past studies
at the Technicum that subject was able to develop technirues to apply to photo-
mechanical forging of documents, stamps, and canchots. Subject was betrayed
to Germans, arrested, and sentenced to death for esporage. Subject was able
to drag this case out by implying the existence of a lerge British run net
of which he was a part. In 1945 he was liberated by the U.S. Army and returned
to Paris. Subject lived there in relative quiet until he, together with a war-
time friend, robbed a Paris bank of a isscable amount of money. Subject and
scumplice were apprehended by the Surdie on 11 July 1950, sentenced to prison,
but released same five years later for good behavior and on the basis of their
war record.

SUBJECT: W/T Training - Agent AESAPIC
REF
: SR/TOB 60-1990, 29 June 1960
1. This, will confirm recent discussions held between
Mr. Fred Kirkpatrick of your Office and Mr. Lee Jungen of my
Staff relative to the proposed W/T training of AESAPIC. As
was explained by Mr. Jungen, W/T training an agent on a
full or part-time training. The most upon the approval of a
specific project with supporting communications annex. While
we have taken this participated in "holding" training of
agents without benefit of a definite requirement, current
operational committees now make this impossible.
2. Should a definite requirement for the international
utilization of AESAPIC develop we will arrange for the W/T
aptitude assessment and training of the private unitist
and the other. We tried that a representative of your
Office discuss operational details with an appropriate
Foreign Division within the Office of Communications. This
will enable us to tailor subsequent training in terms of
specific equipment and procedures as required by the project.
In this respect, further information can be obtained by
contacting Mr. Lawrence Eisler on extension 05/1.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Biographic Information/Case Officer Evaluation of
David TZIZTICHVILLI, alias David DURWARD
Biographic Information
David TZIZTICHVILL was born 20 December 1919 in Tollisi, Georgia, where
he lived with his parents until 1921. Subject at that time moved to France
with his parents. Subject grew up in France and therefore speaks native
French (Parisian). Subject does not have French citizenship, however, and
must be classed as stateless. Subject earned the first part of his baccalaureat
at Breguet (electro-engineering), then entered the Foreign Legion at the
beginning of WWII. Subject fought in N. Africa until French caritulation in
1940, at which time he was discharged to return home to Paris. In 1943 he went
to Germany as a voluntary worker. Ho worked there primarily as an industrial
electrician. While in Germany he assisted French officer P.O.W.'s to escape,
siding them with cleverly falsified papers, stamps, cachets and oven uniforms.
It is interesting to note that while subject attended school at Breguet, he
also attended the Technicum for Cinematography. It was from these past studies
at the Technicum that subject was able to develop techniques to apply to photo-
mechanical forging of documents, stamps, and cachets. Subject was betrayed
to Germans, arrested, and sentenced to death for espionage. Subject was able
to drag this case out by implying the existence of a large British run net
of which he was a part. In 1945 he was liberated by the U.S. Army and returned
to Paris. Subject lived there in relative quiet until he, together with a war-
time friend, robbed a Paris bank of a sisseable amount of money. Subject and
accomplice were apprehended by the Surete on 11 July 1950, sentenced to prison,
but released some five years later for good behavior and on the basis of their
war record.

2.
It is interesting to note that while in prison, subject invented a nachine
for making cardboard boxes. This nachine was actually built for one of the prison
administrations and put into operation at the prison factory. Upon dischanze from
prison in December of 1955, subject lived, vouried anclwas paroled to his brother
in Cap, France. It was Mille there that subject was contacted by this agency and
subsequently brought to this country for use as one of two agents for Project
ASLIMINEL.
Subject is presently reciding in his Vash. C. apartment and is readily
available for any interviovs.
Subject is onzaged in his eare office in several technical griduicks which
could be of value to this Agency. Two of his ideas have been passed forward
to TSD for development/explcitation. TSD has expressed interest in anotier
of his ideas, the plans for which have just boen completed.
Alion Affairs Staff of Imicration/laturalization has extended subjects'
backstopped residence status until 20 October, 1960.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
At 1130 hrs., 19 September 1960, Mr. Lester Houck and Mr. Edward
Wellies, both of Africa Division, were accompanied to SR/DOB covert
site to discuss full transfer of the remaining ASENTINEL agent,
AESPIC, to Africa Division.
Present for SR/DOB were Mike Rae, C/SR/DOB; Perry Crookhan,
Dep. C/SR/DOB (AESBITINEL Project Case Officer); and Fred Kirkpatrick,
SR/DOB Case Officer.
Mr. Houck and Mr. Welles expressed an avid interest in picking
up AESPIC on contract for operational assignment in Africa Division.
This office agreed to expedite insofar as possible the handing over
of AESPIC and, at the request of Africa Division, to assist in certain
pre-training.
SR/DOB has agreed to arrange for AESPIC certain clandestine
training and processing (denolition, small arms, medical/immunization)
in consonance with Subject's projected assignment.
This action will obviate any Mexican resettlement procedures for
AESPIC.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Biographic Information/Case Officer Evaluation of
David T2ITZICHVI.I, ailas David DURVARD
Biographic Information
David T2ITZICHVI.L was born 19 July 1918 in Tbilis: Georgia;
where he lived with his parents until 1921. Subject at that time
moved to France with his parents. Subject grew up in France and
therefore peaks native French (Parisian). Subject does not have
French citizenship, however, and must be classed as stateless.
Subject earned the first part of his baccalureat at Breguet (electro-
engineering), then entered the Foreign Legion at the beginning of
World War II. Subject fought in N. Africa until French capitulation
in 1940, at which time he was discharged to return home to Paris.
In 1943 he went to Germany as a voluntary worker. He worked there
primarily as an industrial electrician. While in Germany he assisted
French officer P.O.W.'s to escape, alding them with cleverly
faisified papers, stampa, cachets and even uniforms. It is interesting
to note that while Subject attended school at Breuguet, he also
attended the Technicum for Cinematography. It was from these past
studies at the Technicum that Subject was able to develop techniques
to apply to photo-mechanical forging of documents, stamps, and
cachets. Subject was betrayed to Germans, arrested, and sentenced
to death for espionage. Subject was pible to drag his case out by


-2-
implying the existence of a large British run net of which he was a
part. In 1945 he was liberated by the U. S. Army and returned to
Paris. Subject lived there in relative quiet until he, together with a
wartime friend, robbed a Paris bank of a sizeable amount of money.
Subject and accomplice were apprehended by the Surete on 11 July 1950,
sentenced to prison, but released some five years later for good
behavior and on the basis of their war record. It is interesting to
note that while in prison, Subject invented a machine for making
cardboard boxes. This machine was actually built for one of the
prison administrations and put into operation at the prison factory.
Upon discharge from prison in December of 1955, Subject lived,
worked and was paroied to his brother in Gap, France. It was while
there that Subject was contacted by this agency and a: subsequently
brought to this country for use as one of two agents for Project
ALESENTINEI.
Subject is presently residing in his Washington, D.C. apartment and
is readily available for any interviews.
Subject is engaged in his safe office in several technical gimmicks
which could be of value to this Agency. Two of his ideas have been
passed forward to TSD for development/explotiation. TSD has
expressed interest in another of his ideas, the plans for which have
just been completed.
Aileen Affaire Staff of Immigration/Naturalization has extended
Subject's backstopped residence status until 20 October 1966.

Dear Dat (Eduardo)
2a I am asking me if Brasil is really existing, if the
plaines have find him if the small is invented there are they
in the moon? We have send 7 letters No answer. You may cry that
are not writing to you. It is the last one. Colette had written
twice, Annick twice, I have four time, Nelly twice, Nina once, with
different name. That is extraordinary because I hope you
still alive. It is no necessary to talk about your mind. That is
the most important thing to telling you your oncle Keresselids
is dead. Atchiko was here and said he had written also and had
never received an answer.

Paris, March 7, 1960
Very dear Eduurde,
We were beginning to wonder if you were still on this planet or if you had
enupanied
Lategiated to the mooni
Since the note that you sent me a few days after your departure, we haven't
had any news from you. I never received your first letter and I was even very
very
angry for bulk-hed told me that Ach had received news of you and that you were
in South America. As for Nathela I really don't know if she received your
letter but I am going to write her a note. As for the others I don't know
their address. Be so kind as to give it to me so that I can carry out your
ordernill Time passes with incredible suffixness and unfortunately life is so
nunotonousi Apart from Nina's marriage, which was a great success and during
which we had a very good time, there's nothing very interesting. Nina and
Bernard found an apartment very near the house at Bd. Auguste Blignui almost
at the corner of the rue de la Santé, the building which is behind the little
gas station at the end of a long alley-way. Catch on! As for Titi and Aunick
they are still at home but would like to find a place of their own.
You're exaggerating when you say Hopy the "pisser" which is completely
wrong. You should instead say Hory the "bitter" for he bites carefully unfortunately

Yesterday evening the whole family was gathered including leite and Maguy to
(ondemisig)
celebrate, three days alas! 15 sunners! The atmosphere was very friendly, and
just this morning, a letter from you bright and early. It's an extraordinary
piece of luck that it's still in one piece as it was pouring out when I shouted
a letter from you. You can be sure of getting news from the whole family and
I thank you for loving us so sincerely My august former husband has just

caught double pneumonia again, he'll be ladd up at least until September which
has plunged us all into (free translation) our area in debt - a matter of many
naturally! Therefore, I'd like to tell you that your letter makes me very happy.
You should certainly be framed with the most beautiful frame that exists in this
one
whole wide world for there is surely no two like you has far as we are concerned
in
naturally. May heaven take it to consideration toward the remission of all your
sins, ainini Outfill
I stopped this letter yesterday evening when Odile came to visit me to
wish me a happy anniversary with a bouquet of flowers. She stayed for dinner
as well as Maguy and all three of us went to the movies to. see an old film
which was very funny "You Can't Take it With You" in which James Stewart was
still young.
What else is there to tell you, you know our life...nothing has changed.
So, I impatiently await another letter from you telling us what you are doing
with many details. It would be really nice if you could be here for the end
of the year. In the meantime I kiss you affectionately.

1990
SIS
has
Paris, 24 March
Hi Mid,
I hope that unlike myself you received my letter. Since the mailing of the
last letter a sensational event occurred in the family. A fourth daughter for
Atch, Sophie, born on March 13th. As you asked me, I sent them your address and
my congratulations.
Yesterday Loulou came by for a few minutes in the afternoon to give us some
very bad news. His father's condition is very bad. We are afraid it is a tumor
of the lung. Unfortunately, when one says tumor, one often means cancers I hope
to God that I am mistaken. Little (eligible) the cousin of Ramaz had a fine boy
named Christophe; and thet's the latest news!
The children should write you every day, but if you want to chew them out,
here is Nina's address: Mme. Monestier, 159 Bd. Acousticel Panagu, Paris 13.
Nelly has been working since last Monday in a very stylish and territly
expensive little shop. The job of sales clerk seems to agree with her. It is a
store for expensive linperic at the corner of rue Mironesnil and St. Honore.
I am writing you all curled up in the corner of the kitchen for we are out
of heat and today, after a few days of radiant sunshine it is raining in torrentes!
What crimes must I have committed in a previous life to lead such an ugly
life!
Write us quickly and tell us what you are doing. We know nothing, since your
last letter never arrived! I am waiting impetiently for some news from you. In
the meantime, I kiss you affectionately.

Paris, March 25, 1960
Dear "Eduardo,"
Everytody was very happy to hear from you again. You know that Minn and
Mama have already written you as well as, undoubtedly, Nina and Nelly. Therefore,
I'm the very last to write you but that doesn't mean that I don't think of you.
It's almost a year since you left. Time passes rather quickly in spite of
everything. Everybody must have already told you the most important news. So
much the worse if I talk nonsense.
Last August 15 I went to meet Titi in Algeria. We returned together early
in October. A whole year passed without our seeing each other, but with letters
every day, and we found each other as if we had parted the day before, or almost.
It was funny to see Titi exercising his functions as a second lieutenant with a
section under his orders. What a pleasure to find myself with him there. Now
when Bebert and company speak of military service I can join them. The life of
an officer's wife is not so bad. One is spoiled! The first month we were at
the sea shore. Since I love the heat this was just the thing for me! Titi left
every morning at 5 o'clock to join his sedion 25 km from the place where I was
staying and returned only at 4 o'clock in the afternoon; - the weeks passed
quickly except for the beach - and still we could not go very far because of the
guerrillas! In short, apart from going out to lunch, I stayed,so to speak,
shuttered up in my room waiting for the return of my lord and master. I tried
to go swimming alone, but the city and the beach were full of soldiers and I gave
up quickly. You cannot imagine I think what it's like to eat alone as a woman
in a restaurant dining room full of soldiers. I did not dare to raise my eyes
from my plate and, to feel looked at while eating makes you become clumsy. Hardly

any women except some middle-aged ones who give me side ways glances. There
was plenty of youth but then too thay looked at me like a China doll. That's
enough for my "military service".
Titi went back to the school of fine arts, he's coming along fine. Unless
someone offers him a wonderful position he will continue at the school. It will
be very long! He also works for an architect of firm. Finally you know the
procedure having almost been in it yourself, we are looking for an apartment.
As would like to have a home of our own. Certain people don't understand why
we want to leave 1a rue Cabanis since there's enough room there. First of all
there isn't that much! We have to quagp for the bath room if Titi wants to
walk around in his shorts he can't do it (it's not that he is accustomed to doing
this sort of thing) and the people can hear everything that's going on in the
rooms. And then again it's very understandable that we want to have a place of
our own which we will furnish as we like and where we will live as we like. To
spend a full day in bed or to eat at one o'clock in the morning, etc.-and then,
too, there is also a little friction between Mana and me. I'd like to shake her
up. If you can do it by letter don't hesitate. She's getting bitter how can she
do otherwise. She does nothing or next to nothing and she's letting herself go.
She could be so cute if she did what's necessary to get thin, and despite her
15 summers she's still well-built. What she needs is a man to take care of her,
to take her out and pull her out of her coastose or almost comostose state. I
shake her up often but as for me I am abrupt and sometimes I say what should not
be said. I'd like to find her a part-time job, something pleasant which would
cause her to get out, take a walk, see people, etc. Evidently the house is less
gay than previously and,neverthalees,we are still here. What will it be like
when only Nelly will remain who is hardly ever here because she goes out with
Rams. And then there's another thing;people criticise Mana because they see
her with nothing to do - I allow myself to criticise, but I refuse to hear

others do it.
The Ebert Homostier's
He
are almost next door to us, exactly in the building
across the street from the metro (Glaciero. They found an apartment; but, hold on
to yourself 1,600,000 frames deposit. It's crazy. It's their great features
who loaned them the money which they are paying back at the rate of 10,000 from
per month. They have received many gifts and are completely furnished. We see
them frequently. Nelly went to a beautiful school which lasted three months.
The
the
lived
it
very
much,
but
after
foking
out,
she
didn't
find
a
job.
Through
one
of my friends I found her a job as a beginning sales clerk while waiting, but
perhaps at the end she'll like being a sales clerk better. She's been working
since Monday. Nina is still in the sane job. She's waiting impatiently for
Bernard to make enough money so she won't have to work.
Mind is still the same fortunately. As for me, I've changed professions.
I am a model. Don't laugh. Evidently I am beginning in this career, but I hope it
will work out. One can earn a lot of money and it's a tiring business but pleasant
and feminine and a lot more interesting than the job as secretary there you rest
your behind on a chair all day. I began at the beginning of November and I worked
until the month of March. I've been unemployed since then, but I'a doing a lot
of looking around to find something. The manequin "cabiness" are formed only
toward the end of May. I must make some photo tryouts next week. Photography
brings in much more. If only it works out I'd like it very much.
What
more can I write you We see Louis and Néthela quite often. Néthela
has changed jobs and is now earning 150,000 francs a month. Not badi Hurry up
and write us and tell us about the things you're seeing. Do you like Brasil?
Hy dear Eduardo I am going to leave you. Write quickly if you can. I give
you a big kiss and hope to do it for good one of these days.
