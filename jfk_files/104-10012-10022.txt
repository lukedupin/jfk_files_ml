US/82/71
Dear Anthony,
Regarding your letter 6/705 of 10 May 1982, our
records indicate that Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov
traveled to Mexico, France, Spain, the U.S. and Cuba
during the period 1959-61. In 1961, he was assigned
to the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. and
Served there until August 1965. He was variqusly
described as a translator, vice-consult, and attache.
During this tour he attempted to cultivate a U.S.
Government employee assigned to our embassy in Mexico
City.
Dol-
September/October 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald
approved the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in an attempt
to get a visa allowing him to return to the USSR.
Kostikov, as a consular officer, handled this visa
request. We have no information which indicates any
relationship between these individuals other than for the
purpose of Oswald's making his visa request.
Kostikov returned to Mexico City for a second tour of
duty in July 1968. During this tour he was again assigned
to the consular section and the U.S. and the U.S. and
the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. and with following the activities
of the Central American communist parties and left-wing
groups, and he met often with members of these groups,
reportedly providing them with funds and technical
guidance. In July/August 1969, Kostikov made an unusual
Dby trip to Moscow lasting three weeks. (His family
remained in Mexico. ) In July 1970 he made a four-day trip
to flake.
Kostikov's tour in Mexico ended unexpectedly in
September 1971. Our information indicated that he was
not due to leave for another three to four months, and at
the time of his departure, there was some speculation that
the suddenness of his departure was due to the fact that
he was known to Yalvain.
