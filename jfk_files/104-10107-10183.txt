of Initial Missions
This period from 20 June to 10 July 1936 the Soviet Bloc air defense
system, 13 subjecced to eight penetrations of an unprecedented nature, seven
concerns with period of only eight days. It must be remembered that
the
provides the only basis of judging the performance of the Soviet
system. This is important because it is clear from REKAT, referiel that
coscidiarele air defense business is conducted over landlines and thus not
obsered by COMMIT. However, some tentative conclusions may be drawn from
these initial flights and these are indicated as follows:
1. In spite of the effect that these missions came es e surprise,
none of them went undetected. This is clear evidence that their
priorer course extends above (72,000) feet.

2. By 5 July 1956, the fourth flight, the USSR was aware
of the purpose of the missions and were taking counter action.
One positive action was the standard of civil flights while the
mission aircraft was over the USSR, and a second action which is
believed related is the moving of MIG-19 aircraft into East
Germany and Poland on 7 July 1956. Also MIG-19's were moved
into Hungary at about this time.
3. The performance of the Soviet system on the 5 July mission,
2011, was indeed curious. While the action evident from COMIT
is not clear an explanation which appears to fit the known facts
of offered as follows: As a result of the previous missions, the
Sovietment of the Soviet essential facts concerning the missions,
i.e., that they were for recent years. They have showe 65,000
feet, and that a penetration as deep as Moscow was not
probably surmised that the 5 July mission was headed for Moscow when
the track appeared on a northeasterly heading. The loss of the
system was not a major threat to territory was probably deliberate and
the "red herring" track return to the 5 July 1956, and does not
of a convenience to avoid broadcasting a track for all the modes
to see that a "hostile or intruder" was coming over Moscow with no
reduction in the 5 July 1956. This idea is supported by the use
of a raid number as well as the two boys beyond the point
where the track had been "lost". In addition, the 5 July 1956
labeled "hostile or intruder" when it was broadcast after it
had passed beyond Moscow. The reporting of the track when it did
not be a major threat and it has been suggested that other
sations had been instructed not to broadcast the track. Further, it may
o: may not be a coincidence but the height broadcast was almost
exactly half of the true altitude of the mission aircraft, but on
the next missions, four days later, the altitude reporting was
consistently above 50,000 feet.
4. By 9 July 1956, in addition to the evident recognition of
the great height of the mission flights, tracking was better and
in general the performance of the warning system was much improved.
5. The next day, 10 July 1956, the Soviet air defense warning
system closed a 3000 mile track with only two short periods of
confusion or track loss. Altitude reporting was over 60,000 feet
with one plot passed 68,800 which was only 100 feet off target.
6. The first eight missions proved that the air defense warning
system is deployed in depth. This was evident from both the continuity
of track and most forcefully from the ELINT data collected. Some 1461
of the 5 July 1956, the operating in the 3000 mc/s band were
examined by project ELINT as follows: 331, WHIT-37, GAGE-26,
PARTY CAKE-37, Other 30. These numbers cannot be used to
dividual radar sets since the same radar may be intercepted more than
510 TOCEN sites were located, including 213 new sites. Some
dies not permit determination were identified but available information
cluded that these signals include the 1000 mission so that it must be con-
C the limitation of ELINT to the 3000 m/s and new sites. Because
practice of collocating radars on different frames and the Soviet
former of radars may be expected to be at least double the number
c sites.

7. Confusion and track loss seemed to be related to the
presence of large numbers of fighters although the saturation point
has not been determined because of insufficient data.
8. The question of radars for height finding, the capabilities
of
TOKEN in this role, the introduction of ROCK CAKE's end later
developments are discussed in another section. It is believed,
however, that these missions were a catalyst in the introduction
of ROCK CAKEs.
