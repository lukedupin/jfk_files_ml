3. Page 63, line 21; the name "Frank Holcomb"
Mr. Holcomb retired under cover and his past relationship
with the CIA should not be exposed. It is additionally
recommended that the entire paragraph wherein Mr. Holcomb's
name appears (lines 21-24) should be deleted because it ac-
knowledges CIA operations in support of anti-communist political
operations in Italy. (page 105, lines 18-21.)
4. Page 63, line 30 beginning with "By" and ending with
"arrangement" on line 33, page 63. It is recommended that this
passage be deleted since its inclusion not only is not pertinent
2/1 to the narrative but it unnecessarily jarsjliaison with the
British and is an implied insult to the/French/liaison services.
(page 106, lines 4-7.)
5. Page 66 beginning with "Finis" on line 24 and ending
with "world" on line 27. This passage describes a specific CIA

an animated cartoon based on George Orwell's Animal Farm.
(Page 111, lines 6-9.)
6. Page 68, the pseudonym "John F. Rittenhouse" on line 34.
The author's original CIA pseudonym was classified, and even
though compromised, never appeared in the press and still exists
on various currently classified documents. (page 114, line 23.)
7. Page 71, beginning with "Spanish" on line 28 and ending

8. Page 72 beginning with "Eudocia" on line 21 and ending
with "Scribner's" on line 32. This should be deleted because
it describes the Agency's role in the translation, (publishing
and distribution/of Eudocio Ravines' book, The Yenam Way. It
also describes William Buckley's role in that operation as a
CIA officer. (Page 121, lines 17-23 and page 122, lines 1-6.)
9. Page 73 beginning with "Mexican" on line 5 through
"Rivera" on line 8. This should be deleted because it not only

10. Page 73 beginning with "Communism" on line 14 and
ending with "reputation" on line 15. This passage could serve
to identify a former asset in Mexico who is still living. (Page
123, lines 7-8.)
11. Page 73 beginning with "cover" on line 17 through
"legend" on line 19. This should be deleted because it identifies
a CIA-sponsored cover arrangement in Bangkok. Furthermore, this
particular type of cover, the movie industry, has figured in
earlier unfavorable publicity to CIA in other Southeast Asian
countries and thus serves to further render suspect the use of
such cover in still other areas. (Page 123, lines 10-12.)
12. Page 73 beginning with "planned" on line 22 through
"authentic" on line 5 of page 74 and including the footnote on
page 74. This should be deleted because it describes a specific
operation involving the forgery of a page of the/Shaighai Post,
and also includes descriptions of sources and methods. (Page 123,
lines 15-23 and all of page 124 including footnote.)
13. Page 77 beginning with "technical" on line 19 through
"station" on line 21. This should be deleted because it describes
and authenticates a CIA operation. (Page 131, lines 2-4.)
14. Page 80 beginning with "surreptitious-entry" on line 9
through "Embassy" on line 12, page 82. This should be deleted

in its support. (Page 147, lines 6-8.)
16. Page 95 beginning with "quasi-military" on line 11
through "East" on line 16. This should be deleted because it
describes various cover and support facilities used in Far East
Asian countries. (Page 163, lines 6-11.)
17. Page 95 beginning with "Hong Kong" on line 16 through
"Branch" on line 19. This should be deleted because it describes
an operation conducted jointly with a liaison service in Hong
Kong targetted against mainland China and as such is not only
damaging to current American detente efforts but is particularly
menacing to Hong Kong authorities in view of their proximity and
susceptibility to potential Chinese retaliatory pressures. (Page

This passage describes specific CIA operations/ in Tokyo targetted

efforts but are also disruptive to liaison relationships with
the Japanese. (Page 169 line 23 through page 170, line 22,

19. Page 102 beginning with "Despite" on line 6 through

21. Page 108 beginning with "tap" on line 17 through
"Embassy" on line 7, page 109. This passage deals intermittently
with various operational proposals, activities inclding a
recruitment of an identifiable individual, as well as with
sensitive methods of operation, e.g., surveillance teams.
(Page 187, lines 6-24 through page 188, lines 1-15.)

"station" on line 26. The "Ramirez" operation Describes an

need to seek the FBI's prior comments. (Page 189 lines 6-11.)
23. Page 111 beginning with "The" on line 22 through
"triumvirate" on line 23. It would seem that an effort ought
to be made to have this passage deleted or changed since itsz
damage potential to /liaison relationships with the Uruguayan"
services/ is considerable, and it does jeopardize the current

"Djilas" on line 9. This passage should be deleted because it
attests to the Agency's subsidization of publication/ of Djilas'
book. In addition an effort ought to be made to have the author
remove or appropriately alter the rest of the paragraph wherein
he refers to an Agency news service located in "Washington's
National Press Building". (Page 211, line 4.)
27. Page 122 beginning with "from" through "Gaines" on
line 31. It is recommended that OGC's attention be called to
this passage in order that they be made aware of its possib 16
interpretations. (Page 212, lines 4-5.)
28. Page 123 beginning with "Soon" on line 12 through
"Madrid" on line 35. This passage deals with the author's work
on several "Peter Ward" books and, later, his assignment to
Madrid. It is recommended that OGC's/attention be called to
this passage. (Page 212, last line through page 213, lines 1-23.)
29. Page 126 beginning with "Chief" on last line through
"officers" on page 127, line 5. This passage should be deleted
because it specifies the classified activities of a CIA officer,
Roger Gorian, his assignments in Tehran and Brussels), as well
as his involvement in the compilation of a classified "encyclopedia
study" are unwarranted disclosures of Agency methods. (Page 219,
lines 8-13.)
30. Page 130 beginning with "Free" on line 20 through "CIA"
on line 21. This phrase should be deleted because it could serve
to affect the life of one of the principals of the Free Cuba
Committee, Mrs. MaPieda Bourgin, a former witing contact, who
is now employed by the State Department. Page 225, lines 10-11.)
31. Page 150, all of lines 14 through 16. It would appear
that this description of the author's contact with Dr. Barney
Malloy of CIA is very unfair to the latter. Impplies that
Hunt had a special relationship with Dr. Malloy and an effort
ought to be made by OGC to have the author rewrite this version
in order to reflect Dr. Malloy's true role in /this) affair.

32. Page 220, lines 5 through 10. This passage concern-
ing the use of CIA alias documentation by Hunt and others in-
cludes loose language which implies that still another set of
documents was prepared by the CIA for Hunt's use i.e., a
set of documents which was not mentioned during the recent
Congressional "Watersgate hearings". As such this is misleading
and could serve to create additional difficulties for the Agency.
It is recommended that the OGC make an effort to have the author
rewrite this paragraph in order that this potentially damaging
language be removed from his manuscript. (Page 387, lines 4-9.)
