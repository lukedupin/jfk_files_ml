Chief of Station, Madrid
TYPIC/QINAR/Unidentificd Cuban in Zaragoza
1. Osvaldo GARCIA who arrived in Spain nearly two
months ago to supervise the production of two-burner stoves
being manufactured by the Spanish firma Tullers Cataluna, S. A.
(TACA) (TACA is also manufacturing the 10,000 cane wagons for
the Cubans), passed through Madrid on 23 September and told
AMATO-1 that there was an unidentified Cuban in Zaragoza
who is preparing a study on Spanish firms trading with Cuba.
AMATO-1 immediately suspected that this Cuban was an agent
of RYROCK and suggested that GARCIA get to know this person
and try to clicit biographic information as well as attempt
to get a photograph of him for possible identification.
2. Station has no idea who this Cuban might be.

2. It is suggested that Headquarters show AMBEDEW-1 a
number of photographs of QUHOON crewmen preforrably photos of crewmen
on the international circuit including those of QUTRUNK-19,
QUCRASH-1 and QUZONES-1. We would suggest against showing only
those of our assets if photos of other crewmen are not available.

SUBJECT
TYPIC/TECHS/AMAUTO-1
ACTION REQUIRED: BIRTHMIS
1. On 16 January 1969 QUOTIVID reported a discussion
between Subject and the Chief of the 'Rumanian Trade delegation
in Spain, during which the Rumanian asked when they could meet.
Subject invited the Rumanian to his home where, he said, he
has set up a small office and was beginning to work more at
home than in the office, because of the added comfort. (We
wouldn't be surprised if this was suggested by his wife who
have been of his son of her husband.) The meeting was arranged
for 1130 hours on 17 January. AMATO-1 commented that he is
up quite early in the morning, presumably to begin work in
his office.
2. The above report is the first we have received on
Subject's use of his home as an office. The invitation to
the Rumanian, of course, casts suspicion on the nature of the
conversation.
3. Since his move to new quarters, AMATO-1's home is
about 35 miles from two WOFRN staffers - Martin B. CRYUM and
Conrad B. FALAGIARO. (See attached sketch). Edwin B. RATTEREE
lives approximately 200 yards from the AMAUTO hume. This
proximity to AMAUTO-1's home by three staffers brings up the
question of the use of an RF device to monitor conversations
and the fact that the follow-up of the office is not a
has a phone in the office, most likely an extension of the
home phone. For planning purposes, we would appreciate from
MKNOVA a list of requirements for a target study in the use
of an RF device. If other means are available for external
penetration, the information is available for the user. The
comments. Please advise us also if the RF device is still
a controlled item, which cannot be discussed with or released
to liaison. Your earliest reply would be appreciated.

1. In the four month period since the forwarding of ref B,
the QUDOZE and QUTIMID Operations have continued to provide insights
into the program of the PERKUNK official establishment in Spain, the
requirements laid on it and the evolution in the thinking of
the U.S. and the U.S. Government's policy. The finding their contacts
and influence in the political, economic and culture of the
fields. These developments will provide the subject matter for
subsequent dispatches. However, in addition to such conventional
"public relations"; the QUDOZ Reports have recently carried evi-
dence to the industry. Because such activity automatically
means PEBUNK involved in Spain's internal affairs, QUOTA has
taken an even greater than 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 S C C C C C C C C C

compared who learns the details of foreign commerce in order to be
able to convene will with people. Apparently this would be a
type of overt specialty than they would give to tho corade who
in order to hide the true purpose of the world. The world is to
collect information for them as AMAUTO-1 is heard to comment that
they have to "invent" the work of this corade in order that he
might have a definite specialty: AMAUTO-1 sees to be thinking of
a specific person because he comments that he speaks two languages,
that he likes economice, and adds that at the end of two months he
you'd be able to know.
The following the return of AMADRIIT-1 on the 7th of March 68,
via PERUENE national flight, after home leave in PBRUEN, the QUOZK
material reported extensive conversations between AMADRIIT-1 and
AMAUTO-1 on future plans. Two were of MCHQUEI interest:
A. QUOZE Report of 13 March 68. AMAUTO-1 says, "this is
with the American movement in Spain and with the monopoly
that they have here". He says, "In my judgement our
fundamental problem in Spain from the political point of
the world, we have to be able to know what we have to see is
there here, we must get ourselves in motion". "That is a
very important point for us, to ascertain what are their
names, who are those who are here, how they (the Americans)
are moving". He adds that, "If we are able to find out, we
will be able to stop thes completely."
B. QUOZE Report of 14 Mar 68. AMAUTO-1 says that they have
been the most important point of Spain, with the pos-
sibility of our having access (to them) He comments that
Spain, 18 at a crossroads internally and externally. He
says they have to find out what is happening in Spain,
whether they give the workers liberty to strike, etc.
The company has been the most important point of find-
ing out "who are the monarchists, what forces they repre-
sent, to what forces are they united, who are the elements
that are being financed by the CIA and by the American
Embassy". "Which are those scattered elements that the
newspaper of the Movement has accused of being backed by
the American Government, and the new system, and power do they have?"
4. AMAUTO-1 had apparently set great things.
anti-government deoastration by workers and students which, as
Headquarters is aware, the police effectively handled. In a 2
May QUOZE Report, AMAUTO-1 repeatedly commented on what a tremen-
dous failure the demonstration had been; he kept asking AMADRIIT-1
what had happened, why the Spanish people had not responded, why
the workers had not, and finally said "The next demonstration we
are going to name here a member of the Embassy".

"You know why I'm saying this because the CIA is
directly intervening in the internal affairs of the
country, ARAGON can say it, the DGS Director can say
that the DGS Department friend Don Camilo PONSBYKORA
(phon.), and here they are not the most important
because they know very well that here the Soviet
KCB as well as the American CIA can't because the
Spaziards hate it so much. The Americans are trying
to make the DGS Department to be the most important
FRANCO is in power there is always the great danger of
a revolt here. The Americans want to have a government
in Spin of the type Italy, France and West Germany have,
been the same moment, that has a high middle class; and
where there is no sense that the DGS Department has
you have the difference between the individual who is
eating and the individual who is eating a chicken,
then-you have a dangerous problem, because in Latin
America we have but be re in Europe it's different.
The DGS why I'm telling you this they can be inter-
tuning the government that is why we want try to
find out.

ANUETO-1 Discussion of Missiles
1. On 10 January 1968, AMAUTO-1, in one of his many daily
discussions with his subordinates, reflected on the interuitional
position of his country, and among the things he said, we quote
the following which may be of possible interest to addresses.
Although the discussion was not heard because of the
cunctional inflection of the speaker, we feel that the jist of
the discussion is clear and understandable.
"We are demonstrating to the world that Cuba is
favorably disposed to do whatever. (AMAUTO-1 begins
to talk against the United States) that when the
Americans have to raise the number of people in the
country, the American population in radar. (AMAUTO-1 is
speaking excitedly and it is very difficult to understand
each word but it appears that he is talking about the
positions of missiles in Cuba), Havana, Las Várs and
the other, and the other, is the most relevant and
Miami, Now York, and all their bases and all of their
"miorda". if the Americans say they are going to
sud them (missiles? planes?), we will send them; if
they (Americans) say they are going to the other, and
the other, and the other, inside. (AMAUTO-1's sub-
ordinate remarked that 15 October 62 marked a point
in international politics, when the Yankees ordered
the Soviets to withdraw their missiles). (AMUIO-1
injected) "they (the Soviets) presented them (the
Cubans) with ten bombs".
2. Our reason for reporting this fragmentary information is
that AMAUTO-1 might be confirming the presence of of fonsivo nis-
silos in Cuba.

Plano of New Cuban Ambassador in ladrid
KION
1. The new Cuban Ambassador to Spain, Orestes
Guilleroso RUIZ Peres arrived in Madrid on the Iberia flight
of 3 December 1967 accompanied by his wife, Rilda, and three
of the 1967 and 1968. The 1969 conference was arranged
administrator and had let the various components of the
Cuban official establishment in Spain run their own affairs.
This fact plus the inevitable tendency of a bow chief to be
a "new broos" and rearrange things according to his
"new broos" and a "new broos" and "new broos" particularly
within the Embassy. However, the QUDOZK and QUTIUD operations
have shown RUIZ at least initially to be an aggressive and
vell organized individual with ideas of his. own that clearly
reflect his background in commercial affairs and prepared to
be a "new broos" and a "new broos" and a "new broos"
sweeping of a new broos. Underlying RUIZ's actions and
proposals in the clear implication that he came to David
with the specific task of upgrading the Cuban mission in
the 1967 and 1969. The 1969 conference was organized in
Madrid will transmit to the addressees the rolovant
information on this program as it becomes available from the
QUDOZK and QUITHID operations along with information on the
official Cuban personaliation administering the program.
2. A striking difference between RUIZ and his
predecessor was noted in the QUDOZE and QUITHID reports of
that first veek. RUIZ has no inhibitions over the
reduction of the 1967 and 1968. The 1969 conference replaced with
a new model and there was discussion of replacing the other
two Pugeots with new ones. Milda, RUIZ's wife, was picked
up by the wife of GOVIN dio turned $200 over to her to go
shopping at the Corté Ingleas, one of Kardid's two best

known department stores. RUIZ checked with CALLO, his
deputy, on the proper clothes for diplomatic functions in
Madrid and an appointment was to be made with a tailor.
Nilda declared that the apartment where CALVADILLA and his
family had lived economically was inadequate and they
decided to look for a chalot, something very spacious and
nearly, and they were not a great deal of experience. The
known to rent for 30,000 pesetas ($500) per month and then
turned it down, apparently for reasons other than price. A
new tolex: machine was ordered for the Embassy. The technician
stated they could install a to1teype that could only receive,
not send, messages but this seemed acceptable.
3. On Monday, 4 December 1967, the after his arrival,
RUIZ said that the family was a house of the U.S. Sevilla and
Vizo to Hadrid for a meeting. The order was couched in terms
of "wanting to meet" them, but after their arrival on
Wednesday, 6 December, all parties settled down to a detailed
meeting in which primary attention was given to administrative
information. The meeting was held on the meeting, and the
be dealt with in separate dispatches. On the administrative
side, RUIZ listened sympathetically to complaints about low
salaries, old buildings and inadequate operating budgets and
concluded by asking for a monthly report on receipts and
expenses and charges. The meeting was not met needs, their
opinions and concerns and their administrative activities. The
printing and telephone bills were the two activities of expense
that kept recurring throughout the discussions.
4. By the end of the week, RUIZ had prepared a report
on the situation he found in the Chancerry and the mission
in general for forwarding to Havana and which he first
discussed with his subordinates. He started by the
meeting, and he was asked to be given by a long all the
comrades in this mission" and declared that the staff was
complete. Apparently, RUIZ intends to make no personnel
changes and Hector GALLO Portieles, who had previously been
most eager to return PCS to Havana, now has gone to Havana.
on vacation. He left Madrid on the 20 December 1967 Iberia
fights.
5. The Cuban mission has certain financial problems
since the present budget dates from previous year's and does
not cover current expenses. However, the "new economic
activities of the consulate" are expected to assist with the
problem. Here RUIZ is presumably referring to the pressure
of the American military, including the American military
the Spanish Foreign Office working through the Customs and
the Immigration Office to force Cuban exiles to register
with the Cuban consulate and pay the $22.50 fee for a valid
passport. Enough exiles have responded to this pressure to
relieve some of the financial problems of the Cuban mission.
This source of income will last as long as the Cubans' friends
in the United States, and the United States are not.
6. The reception of Cuban official travelers at the
airport and the handling of Embassy pouches poses a
continuing administrative problem for the Embassy. Jose
DIAZ Puga, who is in charge of this airport work has to
devote himself exclusively to take a new and more than 20
years of time. He has been a living visitors to fend
for themselves. This situation has been alleviated by
other Embassy staff members jaunting out to the airport at
will to meet the incoming planes. Now, RUIZ has declared
that the rest of the staff must stay in the Embassy because
they have a work plan to fulfill. Thus, he has left himself
with an unresolved problem he must face in the very near
future.

7. The new Ambassador concluded his report with three
recommendations:
a,
Rent another building where the Chancillary,
the Commercia Office, the Consulate and the
Cubana Offices can all be housed instead of
being dispersed in separate buildings as they
are now;
b. Rent or proferably buy a residence for the Chief
of Mission. The one they now have is not
adequate;
c.
Send another person from Cuba who has the
background to take care of scientific work plus
following the contacts the Mission will have
already made. In view of RUIZ's previous
statement on the completeness of the staff, such
a person would likely be a "non-official"
representative of one of Cuba's cultural fronts
such as the Casa de las Americas.
8. RUIZ concluded his remarks by saying that in Spain
there is a tremendous field for the Cubans, they have no
language problem and they can do a great work. Such is the
goal RUIZ has" proclaimed and that Station-Madrid believes
he was sent to attain.

1. Guillermo RUIZ Perez, Charge d'Affaires of the
Culán Em.assy in Madrid, has occupied that post for
nearly a year. During that time, the QUDOZE/QUTIMID
material has revealed various facets of his personality,
showing him to be a man of volatile temper, an incessant
talker and with more breadth of experience and outlook
than the other members of the local Cuban mission.
2. In this public relations RUIZ seems to 'do well

may-be he feels it is worth establishing "some kind of

to persons with a good reputation in the intellectual

in outlining his plans for the Embassy's activities. He
has shown a certain intellectual restlessness, a desire
to keep abreast of events in the world outside of Cuba
and the world. He has been interested in meeting

early conversations with his staff soon after his arrival,
he extolled the virtues of the Yankee system of "briefing"

economically it was now necessary to give attention to
the political and cultural fields. He later commented
on the fact, that Cuba is practically unknown in Spain,
and the most acts are never seen in the local stores
and that the views of the average Spaniard has
come from the exiles. He has to discuss the
need for advertising Cuban products and to
decreating his office and his home with Cuban items and
their own products. He is little bit of Cuba to his
Spanish and foreign contacts. He is consequence of
this desire to put Cuba's best foot for the certain
harshness in dealing with the shortcomings of his
society. He is the following Cubans outside the mission, calling
attention to any deficiencies in their conduct and ways

1. At the time the referenced dispatch was prepared,
the QUOZE Reports were showing the beginning of a full
fledged fight between Guillermo RUIZ Perez, the Charge
d'Affaires of the Cuban Embassy in Madrid and his first
Secretary, Hector GALLO Portiales, and the Chairman in
human relations, and the business issues proved the vehicle
of the U.S. and the deeper conflicts and problems. In this
case, the primary problem can be simply summarized. The
members of RUIZ's staff operate independently and
their
informed
by
chief and he feels he is neither consulted. This particulariy
his suit is to be a major challenge of his sales particularly
when a relation to GALLO. The specific issues which
sparked their quarrels were RUIZ's dispute with Emilio
ROMERO, editor of the newspaper Public, and the distribution
of Che GUEVARA's Diary.
2. A QUOZE Report of 2 July 1968 outlined a hot
discussion of the new when RUIZ went into a rage over a
discussion GALLO had received from Emilio ROMERO. RUIZ
and ROMERO are not on speaking terms whereas GALLO and
ROMERO get along well. GALLO said he feared enmity with
ROMERO would bring about the public, but it was a
unfavorable to Cuba whereas RUIZ replied that when the first
unfavorable article comes out, will take it to the
Foreign Minister and settle the matter on that level. He
believes that he represents Cuba in Spain and that his

subordinates should back him by taking the same positions
in public that he takes, a not unreasonable demand on
the part of a Chief of Mission. RUIZ bluntly told GALLO
that he GALLO, had committed an error and GALLO just as
the right to get the same position. He was a very good
in a bad humor and nothing pleased him whereas RUIZ felt
GALLO- should try putting himself in RUIZ's place, something
he- claims GALLO is incapable of doing. Finally, this
particular argument ended in a form of compromise with
GALLO agreeing to call ROUERO the following day and remind
him that he has been the most important.
3. On 4 July the battle was renewed over the
distribution of Che's Diary. At that time the Embassy
only had 6 or 7 copies which were being loaned out on an
overnight basis. RUIZ said he wanted to send the Diary
"to a mountain of the House of the House of the House
of the House of the House of the House of the House of
his list of recipients. RUIZ scolded him roundly for this
and, ignoring GALLO's attempts at self-justification, told
him he had to respect the instructions he received. At
one point, he said he said he said he said he was at
least it would be better for one of them leave and go
to work in another country, for example Rumano's Several
interesting items emerged from this long quarrel:
A. GALLO has some undefined problem which Station
Madrid assumes is related to his personality and his
approach to his fellow workers. Ruiz said, "Look,
GALLO, here everyone knows the problem you have. It
is not a good thing that you have. That's what you
the comrades that have come here through many years
know of the problem. " Ruiz then insisted on the
importance of discussing problems among the comrades
and said "for example in your case, you have been
foolish in not outlining the problem. I was waiting
and especially to be able to get the same.
RUIZ commented that now he can understand
the attitude of GALZADILLA. Before, he had thought
CALZADILLA was in error but now he feels the same way.
He mentions "an ambivalence" and says he will not
react the same way, "that CALZADILLA was wrong in
limiting himself to "a reduced group of persons whereas
I will continue to go forward; but with everyone, not
Just a RUIZ.
RUIZ takes a broader view of Party membership
than his contemporaries. In commenting on the weekly
study circle for members of the Party, he set forth
his opinion that all the comrades of the local Cuban
Mission should participate even though they may not
be members because in his eyes it is as if they all
really were members.
D. RUIZ respondents a statement he has made on
previous years - the great interest of his life
preved. The most important part of the
is foreign commerce. However, in this 4 July QUOZE
Report, he added the interesting detail that he had
not wanted to come to Madrid as Charge and, in affect,
had been persuaded to come against his will. He
believes he is best able to serve in the control of
industry and that is where he could perform a
tremendous work for his country is every revolutionary

ought to be in the place of work where he is able
to do the most, "thill now, I have always
and have always gone where the revolution sent me
with my present limitation of criteria, I should
not be here". He repared his conviction that he
is wasting his talents and doing nething for Cuba
in the position of Charge in comparison with what
he is. He is the most important one of the which
I am best able to serve my country is in tre
control of industry I put myself in an industry
and I see if things are being done well or if they
have been. I have been there have knowledge and
because I arrive at my conclusions through the
accounting look, here I am waiting my presence
and my resources when I am able to be useful to
production in another position."
By the end of this 4 July report, RUIZ had exhausted all
his combativeness and appeared very depressed.
4. RUIZ is due for home leave in Havana the first
part of August. There have been indications scattered
throughout the QUDOZE and QUTIMID Reports of the last
month or two that he might not return. The information
given in Paragraph 1-D above seems to make this
possibility even in the past. It is a "developement that
Station. I am aware that the stock closed.
5. The arguments ended inconclusively. Neither man
could afford to carry the baittle to the ultimate conclusion
of an open break. GALLO has tried to make some pro-forma
gestures acknowledging RUIZ as head of the Mission and
the new development of long on home leave. However, the forcor
close association notes that the new development of a
they are more distant and cool. GALLO at one point in
this same 4 July QUDOZE Report mentioned how he had looked
forward to working with RUIZ and QUDOZE had shown an
understanding of the new development of a new system with
daily discussions of the problems of the Mission and the
events of the day. Now, their relationship is cool,
correct and business-like. The personalities of the two
of the new development of a new system will be a
quick temper, shouted and used harshr course language and
in the end got nowhere; GALLO did not raise his voice,
although his language was no improvement over that of his
boss, and tried to sound reasonable but never gave in an
understanding of the new development of a new system
the end nothing was resolved except possibly to clear the
air of some of the tension between the two men for in a
10 July QUDOZE Report, RUIZ was still complaining about
CALLO's friendship with Emilio ROMERO and saying that
GALLO only wanted to be out meeting people and not
preparing written memos on his work!

TANUTO-I Discussion of Missiles
ACTION BOURGED
1. On 10 January 1968, AMAUTO-1, in one of his many daily
discussions with his subordinates, reflected on the international
position of his country, and among the things he said, we quote
the following which may be of possible interest to addressees.
Although part of the discussion was not heard because of the
emotional inflection of the speaker, we feel that the list of
the discussions was not a matter of questions.
"We are demonstrating to the world that Cuba is
favorably disposed to do whatever. (AMAUTO-1 begins
to talk against the United States) that when the
Americans have to raise the white flag because the
first plane that appears on radar. (AMATO-1 is
not a matter of questions) that is not a matter of
standard
each word but it appears that he is talking about the
positions of missiles in Cuba), Havana, Las Villas and
Camaguey and that with these missiles, we can cover
the first place of the press. (AMATO-1 is not a
"mierda". if the Americans say they are
said them (misc:les? planes?), we will send them; if
they (Americans) say they are going to invade us, the
first plane that comes to invade. (AMATO-1's sub-
ordinate the press). IS October 62 marked a point
in international politics when the Yankees ordered
the Soviets to withdraw the defense. (AMOTO-1
injected) "they (the Soviets) presented them (the
Cubans) with ten bombs".
2. Our reason for reporting this fragmentary information is
that AMUTO-1 might be confirming the presence of offensive mis-
siles in Cuba.

When Guillermo RUIZ Perez, the new Cuban Charge met
1

with the Cuban consuls following his arrival in Spain, the
2
2
CNEUT was a long meeting at which primary attention was
given to administrative matters, trade and propaganda. The
subject of propaganda will be dealt with in this dispatch.
2. The-Castro regime has always attached great
importance to propaganda activities of all kinds and when the
new Cuban Charge d'affaires began to re-organize the work of
the American Association of the American Association overlooked.
According to the QUDOZE and QUTIMID operations, the
provincial consulates have been receiving four types of
propaganda for distribution, two of which were identified.
One was the propaganda put out by the organizations created
by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department
The other is newspapers. PACHECO, Consul in Seventh
mentioned Gramma, which he claimed many people read, and
added that lately he had been receiving Juventude Rebelde.
3. RUIZ's ideas apparently go beyond hand-shaking and
the distribution of propaganda. He asked the consuls to
make a list of all the institutes and all the scientific
centers in their territories including the special positions
of the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department
are to use these lists to develop a systematic work plan
of visiting each one, making friends, trying to obtain
scholarships for Cuba, trying to obtain publications and
propaganda of every type, free if possible or by subscription

if necessary. The consuls were told to go with the attitude
of "looting".
4. Even while he was laying these responsibilities
on his consuls, RUIZ was busy within the Embassy. In
discussions with Andres MARTIANZ, a Spansis, privilege who
had been the most important responsible for publication
of the Embassy bulletin, RUIZ mentioned that he is
interested in offering Cuban documentaries to Spanish Cine
(Movie) Clubs as they now have a large number, "an infinity",
of documentaries show the most important evidence.
In the history, RUIZ also asked to see copies of
the Embassy bulletin and in the meantime suggested MARTINEZ
do a bulletin drawing a parallel between Gibraltar and
Guantanamo. Finally, according to a QUDOZE and
11 December 1967, he said that the second person ordered
his own article, plan for cultural activity. In this
context cultural activity is not limited to art; music and
literature but also includes public information media. The
Cuban Embassy has already built a new media community contacts
with the U.S. and the American Revolution seems to draw
a ready response in Spanish intellectual circles as
evidenced by the Spanish delegates attending the Cultural
Congress held in Havana from 4-11 January 1967. He has hea-
paid trip is always not a very good but the delegates,
many of whom were not communists, were also sympathetic to
the host. Accordingly, within the limits imposed by the
conformity of the "strong, Station Madrid expects an increase in
the propaganda and political action activities of the Cuban
official establishment.

known department stores. RUIZ checked with GALLO, his
deputy, on the proper clothes for diplomatic functions in
Madrid and an appointment was to be made with a tailor.
Nilda declared that the apartment where CALZADILLA and his
family had lived or a great deal of attention.
The house is one of a chalkt, something very spacious and
well-priced. They subsequently seriously considered one
known to rent for 30,000 pesetas ($500) per month and then
turned it down, apparently for reasons other than price. A
new telex machine was ordered for the Embassy. The technician
stated they could install a telephone that could only receive,
not a single.
3. On Monday, 4 December 1967, the day after his arrival,
RUIZ ordered the Cuban consuls in Barcelona, Scvilla and
Vigo to Madrid for a meeting. The order was couched in terms
of "wanting to meet" them; but after their meeting, the
Wednesday, 6 December 1967, he said, "I know down to a detailed
meeting, the company attention was given to administrative
matters; trade and propaganda. The latter two subjects-will
be dealt with in separate dispatches. On the administrative
side, RUIZ listened sympathetically to the company, and
salaries, old builders, and the company operating budgets and
the company's share for a monthly report on receipts and
expenses and a report on the consuls' current needs, their
monthly balances and their administrative activities. The
printing and telephone bills were the two items of expense
that kept recurring throughout the RUIZ.
4. By the end of the week, RUIZ had prepared a report
on the budget of the company's factory and the mission
in general for forwarding to Havana and which he first
discussed with his subordinates. He started by assuring
them that he had "found great co-operation among all the
comrades in this mission" and declared that he was
complete. Apparently, RUIZ intends to make no personnel
changes and Hector GALLO Portiles, who was previously been
most eager for return. P.S. to Havana, 20 December 1967, Iberia
on the attention. He left him.
5. On the second place on his certain financial problems
since the present budget dates from previous years and does
not cover current expenses. However, the "new economic
activities of the consulate" are expected to assist with the
problem. Ilere RUIZ is presumably referring to the pressure
brought to bear in November 1967 by Cuban sympathizers in
the Spanish Foreign Office working through the Customs and
the Immigration Office, which was a major threat to the
with the Customs and the state and pay the $22.50 fee for a valid
renewment. Enough exiles have responded to this pressure to
relieve some of the financial problems of the Cuban mission.
This source of income will last as long as the Cubans' friends
in the Foreign Ministry are able to assist them.
6. The reception of Cuban official travelers at the
airport and the handling of the military, the American Union
is a major state for the problem for the Embassy. Jose
DIAZ Puça, who is in charge of this airport work has to
devote himself exclusively to taking care of the couriers
and their poucies when any come in, and the country's food
and food. He said, "I have been, been alleviated by
other Embassy staff members jaunting out to the airport at
will to meet the incoming planes. Now, RUIZ has declared
that the rest of the staff must stay in the Embassy because
they have a work plan to fulfill. Thus, he has left himself
with an unresolved problem he must face in the very near
Juture.

7. The new Ambassador concluded his report with three
recommendations:
a. Rent another building where the Chancillary,
the Commercial Office, the Consulate and the
Cubana Offices can all be housed instead of
being dispersed in separate buildings as they
are now;
b. Rent or preferably buy a residence for the Chief
of Mission. The one they now have is not
adequate;
c. Send another person from Cuba who has the
backside and to take care of scientific work plus
promising the contacts the Mission will have
already made. In view of RUIZ's previous
statement on the competeness of the staff, such
a person would likely be a "non-official"
representative of one of Cuba's cultural fronts
such as the Casa de las Americas,
8. RUIZ concluded his remarks by saying that in Spain
there is a tremendous field for the Cubans, they have no
language problem and they can do a great work. Such is the
goal RUIZ has proclaimed and that Station Madrid believes
he was sent to attain.

REP:
AR-2294, 30 Nov. 1967
