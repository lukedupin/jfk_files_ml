MEMORANDUM FOR : Miss Ann L. Goodpasture
THROUGH
: Administrative Officer, CI Staff
SUBJECT
: Application to Purchase Service Credit
1. This is to advise you that your application to purchase service credit
under the CIA Retirement and Disability System has been processed. The pe-
riod of your service which is not covered by retirement deductions and the
amount due to cover this period are as follows:
Redeposit Period
Total Amount Due
11 Mar 1942 - 8 Sep 1943
$241.00
2. Postponing payment will cause the amount due to increase because of
additional interest at the rate of 3 per cent compounded annually. However, so
long as the amount is not paid, you have the use of this money for other purposes.
You may postpone payment until you retire.
3. If the redeposit is not made you will receive no credit in the computa-
tion of -nuity for the period of service covered by the refund. This usually
results in a sharp reduction in the amount of your annuity.
4. If you wish to make payment for the redeposit period, please make your
check payable to the Treasurer of the United States and forward it to the Chief,
Retirement Operations Branch, 205 Magazine Building. If you prefer, you may
make inatallment payments or arrange for bi-weekly payroll allotments of $25.00
or multiples thereof. A receipt showing a statement of your account will be sent
to you acknowledging each installment payment.

1. David Konan has askod that I atate my preference with
read to hoss leave and reasignment. I will be eligible for home
leave in July 155 but it is not urgent that my leave be scheduled
exactly when due. I would like, however, to know what opportunities
exist with headquarters and whether I should be looking elsewhere
for employment after July 1053.
2. With regard to another two year tour of duty in
Monterrey, you could prefer one reasonable job than in foreseeable
here. Now that is the room for files are set-4 and the administrative
routine is established, my job, while termi Administrative Assiat-
ant, is mainly that of a cbric-typist. The practice in typing has
been good for me bit I would like to look forwarl to a more re-
sulted basis for the business. The company's office is a company
I am performing the same type job which I did in 1454 at a CAF-4
and a considerably less responsible job than the one performed at
headquarters as a P-2. While I have been taking Spanish lessons,
I know that I am not proficient enough in the language for an
assigement in Latin America, and feel that I would be better off
in another.
3. For the benefit of the case officer in assigning a
replacement, Kenan has suggested that I outline the duties which
my replacement should be trained to perform. The routine can be
learned in the field within two or three weeks.
a) Copy typing. About 75% of the time will be taken
up with routine typing.
b) Index carding. About 600 index cards a week are now
being typed for the card files and for the viaa section
files.
c) Fregaration of courier mail. Couriers usually go
to the border approximately every two weeks but there is
no regular schedule, and pouches are sometimes prepared
on a fes hours notice.
d) Communications. The incumbent should have complete
training for our codes for he will not have much practice
in the field as only two or three messages are transmitted
monthly.

e) Photography: At the present time, considerable
operational time in being made of a -darcroan at
reaidense. In addition to my own photographic
equipment, the station photographe equipment is
used there. My replacement should be trained in the
use of the duo-printer and in 35mm copy work. If he
has no personal photograghic equipment, headquarters
may wish to issue his a camera as there is only one
camera at the station. Most of the copy work has been
done with my personal rolleiflex and emlarger.
f) Administrative Reports.
(1) Station Funds. He will be responsible for
dispensing fumia, keeping records and preparation
of the monthly accounting reports.
(2) Property. He will be responsible for keeping
records of government property and preparation of
periodic reports and inventories.
(3) Exchange commodities. He will be responsible
for keeping records and preparing periodic reports
and inventories.
g) Faintensnee of Files. The station files are set-up
along the lines recommended by headquarters, and should
require little time for unkeep.
h) Information Reports. Dependent upon the clerical
workload, he may assist Karen in the preparation of
information reports.
1) Cover Job. None. If there are only two people at
the station, the replacement for my job would not have
time to perform a cover Job and consequently, would have
no regular working relationship with the Philip Morris employees.
A resourceful person can find Honterrey a very
enjoyable post-aid. The program will be prepared to
dull plass and either a single girl or man can find plenty of
things to do. There are a limited number of single persons here,
but one can always find somewhere to go and something to do. The
American colony, as a whole, is the friendliest group that I have
been at any post and they are very gracious with invitations to
their own man. If headquarters has someone in mind for this post
and will be able to laboration on living conditions in Honterevo, I
shall be glad to forward them on request.

Miles Ann L. Goodpasture reported back to SI Washington
from Shanghai on 1 April 1946. On the trip back, one developed
a rather serious ear ailment, and it is forced that an operation
may be necessary. Dr. Thompson of the Medical Division was going
to attempt to have her admitted to a hospital Monday night for
further attention and treatment. After release from the hospital
she will go to her home in Tipton, Oklahoma.
In view of the above facts, we shall show Miss Goodpasture
as being on sick leave (approximately one month) until her rotura
to duty, at which time she will fill out the form 71 and may other
necessary papers.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: Ann L. GOODPASTURE
18 October 1970 - 31 October 1971
To the immense regret of this writer Ann Goodpasture
is retiring very soon. It would be silly to rate her
competitively against any of her colleagues, male female,
and women who are not concerned. The reason for these
it recorded that she is very fit indeed to perform any of
the tasks listed as her current ones or almost any others
I can think of at almost any grade. I venture to rate her
over-all performance, thirty years of it, as OUTSTANDING.
Ann is one of the tough warp-threads on which this organiza-
tion is woven, and when she refires the fabric of this
organization will be weakened.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL:
Miss Goodpasture is indeed a fine officer who consistently
turns in a Strong performance when she is not doing an out-
standing job. She is an excellent office and project manager
who is cost conscious and she is a careful thorough instructor
and briefer. Her retirement will leave a great gap in CI/OPS
and, as Mr. Johnson has said, in the organization. I hope
she gets the official Agency recognition she deserves for
the many years she has made substantive contribution to the
C's.
