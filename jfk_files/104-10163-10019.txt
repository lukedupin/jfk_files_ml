MEMORANDUM OF CONTACT

Do Not Reproduce
SUBJECT : Jose Antonio CASAS Rodriguez (201/327702)
DATE OF CONTACT : 2 May 1963 (2000 to 2345 Hours);
4 May 1963 (0800 to 1300 Hours).
1. On 1 May 1963 I travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,
and attempted to contact Subject at his home at (216 Cumberland Street) (0)
at 1030 hours. Subject's son answered the door and advised that his
father was out for the evening and wasn't expected to return till 2200
hours. At 2200 hours 1 returned to Subject's home to be advised that
he had not yet returned but was expected momentarily. In view of the
late hour, I requested the son tell his father that a representative of
the United States Government had called and wished to speak to him on
matters pertaining to the situation in Cuba. I indicated I would return
about 2000 hours on 2 May.
3. At 2000 hours on 2 May I called at Subject's home and found
him present. He was friendly and courteous, requesting that 1 come
into the home where I was introduced to his wife and several of his six
children. He requested to see my KUBARK identification which he gave
only a cursory glance before returning to me. He then indicated his
complete willingness to supply any information known to him on the Cuban
situation and parsonalities.
3. Subject and his wife makes an excellent impression. They
proceeded to put ma at ease, offered coffee, and generally showed them-
selves to be excellent extroverted hosts. The subsequent conversation
lasted until approximately 2346 hours and was somewhat general in nusture.
Basically we rehashed information already provided by Subject during
his debriefing by U. S. authorities in Miami and already reflected in his
301 dis. Subject was rather difficult to debrief in that his English is
somewhat fractured and he is extremely disorganized in his threights.
As has a leadership to develop one theme which in turn will remind him

of a second, also of interest, which he will proceed to discuss to the
confusion of the first. This problem was perhaps compounded by the
fact that Subject was uncertain as to the type of information of interest
to KUBARK. He grasped quickly, however, the type of information
which would be of most interest to us and it rapidly became less difficult
to get to the meat of the subject we were discussing. Further contact
and debriefing of him will become progressively less difficult.
4. We are consolidating the information obtained from Subject
from our two meetings with him on 2 and 4 May below for reporting
convenience.
5. Beatically Subject is able to supply specific information of
interest on only five personalities. lie knows and was acquainted with
many other personalities in the Cuban government, but his relationship
with them is not close enough to enable him to provide information in
sufficient detail or depth to allow valid assessment as to their success-
thibility to a recruitment or other operational approach.
6. Information on five Cuban government officials, well known
to Subject is set forth below:
a. Esubio AZCUE, born about 1912, is presently
employed as a consul at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico
City. AZCUE is a long time friend of Subject. They met
during the mid-1950's when both were involved in revolu-
tionary activities attempting to bring about a democratic
socialist regime in Cuba. AZCUE is married to a Spanish
woman and was involved in the Spanish revolution. He
was a very close friend of Manolo (ASTRO who was
a former president of the American American Association
reverbilminries which included Field CASTRO. about
1962 AZCUE was living in France and is believed to have
been arrested by French authorities en charges resulting
from his involvement in smuggling penicilia and other
antibiotics into France. Subject believes that AZCUE has
about five children. During early 1961 while in Mexico
City, AZCUE was contacted by Subject in order to obtain
advice re the advisability of his defecting from the Castro
regime and requesting political asylum in Nexican. As a

result of this contact Subject obtained the impression that
AZCUE is suffering from a lack of funds. Since AZCUE
is somewhat of a snoo and a fancy dresser, he finds this
situation unpleasant. AZCUE also habitually has a mis-
tress which in turn is a drain on his pocketbook.
(1) According to Subject, AZCUE is an
excellent dramaman who studied architecture
at the University of Halaman, although he never
obtained a degree. Subject assesses him as a
kind man, very happy-go-hucky, but impetuous
and one who "blows with the wind". He doesn't
seem to have the powers of concentration or of
single purpose which would allow him to be suc-
cessful. Subject feels that AZCUE has appended
himself to the Castro regime since it offers him
a purpose in life and a feeling of belonging to
something.
(2) Subject described AZCUE as being a
very brave man. He felt that should AZCUE be
approached by UBAARK and the most to coop-
ment of the American American Internet to
agent work would not affect his decision. In
summary there would be a reasonable chance of
persuading AZCUE to cooperate with KUBARK if
a suitable monetary and ideological inducement
were offered him. Subject feels, on the basis of
their 1861 conversations in Mexico City, that
AZCUE is not too enthused about the Castro regime
and it is possible he has become even less in
favor of it during the ensuing period.
(3) Subject: appended that it would be helpful
in any approach to AZCUE to attempt to convince
him that Fidel CASTRO was directly involved in
the "gungter" revolutionary group responsible for
Mamolo CASTRO's murder. AZCUE was a very
close friend of Manolo CASTRO's and was affected
greatly by his death.

b. Enrique RODRIGUEZ Loches: RODRIGUEZ was
born about 1912 and is presently Cban Ambassador to
Morocco. RODRIGUEZ was involved for a long time in
revolutionary attempts to overthrow the BATISTA and pre-
vious regimes in Cuba. He was with CASTRO during the
1958-59 period in the Sierra Miasatre. Subject became
noted and with and a close friend of RODRIGUEZ when
both were not the same. The same so-called revolutionary
"Directorio". Subject all the following: "The
lived CASTRO since their first meeting during the 1958-59
period. Both Subject and his wife alleged to have received
a letter from RODRIGUEZ written in the Sierra Miasstre
in which he listed his dislike of CASTHO and among other
things referred to him using the Spana equivalent of the
1958-59. Yet, by恆stitute". Subject advised that unfortunately
this letter, the President Subject is convinced that
if he met RODRIGUEZ on the state! tomorrow the latter
would have no conçumptions about setting down for a long
discussion on old times as well as the political situation
in Cuba. Subject is also convinced that he could on friendly
terms "talk defection c: recruitment with RODRIGUEZ
should they have the opportunity to move.
c. Orlando BLANCO, born about 1923, is married to
a woman of Puerto Rican birth which makes her an American
citizen. BLANCO, according to the latest information avail-
able to KUBARK, is stationed with the Cuban Embassy in
Morocco with the rank of counselor. Subject met BLANC.:
when the latter became subordinate to him in the revolu-
tionary "Directorio" working towards the overthrow of the
Eftaia regime. Despite BLANCO's revolutionary activities,
the American Times as being relatively passive politically.
Both BLANCO and in 1923 he believed to have applied for
employment with the Cuban foreign service as a means of
leaving Cuba. Subject feels that is possible they will not return
to Cuba when their tour in Males' eyes. During 1960-61
BLANCO was employed in the National Park of Cuba. During
this period Subject obtained the impression being BLANCO
had become anti-Castro. Subject, however, assesses BLANCO
as a non-couragious type of individual who might be fight-
ened at the Idea of working as an in-place agent. As an

example of BLANCO's lack of courage, Subject cited the
fact that he and his wife aten.pted to avold Subject's wife
while Subject was an aaylee in the Argentine Enbassy in
Hahana, Incidentally, BLANCO's wife's name is Isabelle
LAGO de Blanco and the is on excellent terms with Subject's 08
wifn Subject is apparently convinced that BLANCO would
we Ceome an opportunity to meet with him providing he
sacured that the fact of the meeting would not become known
to hala Cules auropora.
Furre CHOMON 1ediavilla (201-270370): in es-
cesses Subject was only able to reiterate the background
inferior of a cos CHOMON outlined in paragraph 5 of UFCW
1874, 13 Jalan 1963. In order to place his relationship
with CHOMON in the subject produced a personal
letter to him from CHOMON which was written in January
1965 and referred to Subject in this report, the year of terms.
Subject allaged that CHOMON has confided in his own many
maiters of personal and political nature for man.
As an example, he cited a difficulty in which CHOMON
has been involved during his tenure as Ambassador to the
USSR of his highest subject was (attained in Moscow, CHOMON
at that time having an affair with a Russian translator/
secretary as a group of by the Soviets. This person's
husband became knowledge of the relationship between
his wife and CHOMON and beat on the first day in Cuban
Embassy one day and proceeded to demand that CHOMON
leave his wife alone. Subsequently a formal protition
received through Soviet foreign service channels. As a
villain of this incident, CHOMON asked Subject to
walk with him (the didn't trust the Soviets and felt the
Cuben King of his was bugged, in order to discuss this
problem and it is a solution for it. Although CHOMON
did not specifically state anything in this vein, Subject
obtained the impression during the last two meetings in
the Argentine Embassy in early 1963 that CHOMON was
anything but happy with his lot under the Castro regime.
Subject felt it would be worthwhile and alleged his willing-
ness to prepare a "recruitment letter" for mailing to
CHOMON in Cuba.

SECRET
- 6 -
e. Treal CHON:ON Iedavilla was born about 1830
in Camaguey, and, according to latest KABARI informa-
tion, is presently Charge d' Affarres of the Chon's Regional
is Iraq. Prior to this assignment, CHOMON was the
Secretary with the Cuban E:888883 in Morocco. Subject
described CHOMON as a sensitive, slightly effeminate
individual who is relatively uninterested in politec. Sub-
ject feels that CHOMON outlined the position with the
Cuban foreign service by virtue of the fact that he is Fauire
CHOMON's brother. Subject feels that F. Moreal CHOMON
would also welcome an opportunity to talk with him if the
concern of the problem of the fact that he is a very
ment. He speculated that any attempt to gain CHOMON's
cooperation would depend on the position Fauire CHOMON
has assumed toward the Castro regime. Subject feels
that most of Ficreal CASTRO's decisions are based on the
attitude and opinion of his older brother Fauire. If through
letters from or conversations with his older brother, Floreal
had obtained the impression that Fauire was becoming dis-
satisfied with the Castro regime, he probably likewise
would assume such an attitude and conceivably be receptive
to a recruitment approach.
7. OPERATIONAL PROPOSALS: We are currently retracing
the individuals listed in the proceeding paragraph. Upon completion of
these traces, it is suggested that a dispatch be prepared to Mexico City
Station outlining all information on Esubio AZCUE including that supplied
by Subject. This dispatch would also outline Headquarters interest in
the proposed program. The proposed program was a new program for
City Station would be asked to describe the extent to which they could
support each an operation through surveillance of AZCUE, locating his
present residence and other information relative to this current activities
and political orientation. (Commen:): We discussed in principle with
the Subject whether or not he would be willing to travel to Mexico City
with a KUBARK case officer for the purpose of such an approach. Sub-
ject tentatively indicated his willingness to cooperate in such a venture
but appeared to have some reservation to the danger that might accrue
him. He pointed out that he has a wife and six children to support and
soon expects to be joined by his father and mother-in-law who are cur-
rently in Miami. We attempted to reassure Subject that very little danger

would be involved since he would be under surveillance by NUBARK
officers at all times and would serve only as a means of effecting the
introduction of NUBARK to ALCUE. Although we canad be certain,
we feel that 1. properly presented Subject would cooperate with KUBARK
in such a venture.
8. The information reflected above and relating to RODRIGUEZ,
BLANCO, Floreal CHOMON, and Faure CHOMON, will be made avail-
ably to SAS/11's order to determine whether or not ther nay be interested
in expoliting these leads. An operation involving the preparation of a
letter by Subject for-forwarding to Faure CHOMON would be simple to
prepare but difficult to carry out in that we do not have a current home
address for him. Subject indicated that he believed Faure CHOMON in
1961 lived on First Street, 105, Apt. 7, in Libana. However, we can-
not be sure that this address is current. Subject indicated that perhaps
the most of the Droidry Grillo Living at Auncision 10, 4th floor, in Madrid,
Sandy 1081. The following is the following: the 100% of the 100% of the
She is allegedly the cultural attache with the Cuban Embassy in Madrid.
Forbaps it would be possible to obtain CHOMON's current address
27,15 through COS Madrid. Conceivably COS Madrid could asalits liaison
15-2
with the Spanish service to place intercepts on this address and thus
obtain Faure CHOMON's current home address in Habana, assuming
he is corresponding with this individual.
9. MISCELLANEOUS: We were only able to obtain the names
of two individuals from subject who be believed definitely to be G-3
officers. These were the individuals who accompanied Faure CHOMON
when he visited Subject in May of 1961 at the Argentine Enbassy in
Habana. The first of these was Carlos FIGARELLO, aka El Chino,
FIGARELLO was born about 1930 and Subject was able to say little more
about him than this in as much as he spent most of the time during this
meeting taking with Faure CHOMON. Cu CHOMON's second visit to
the Argentine Embassy he was accompanied by (fina) JIMENEZ, aka
Wincenito, also born about 1930 and the son of (fina) Santos JIMENEZ,
JIMENEZ was, according to Subject, at one time the director of the
revolutionary newspaper "Combate". Subject was unable to supply
further information on this individual.
10. Subject was shown the KUBARK list of Cuban diplomatic
and consular personnel abroad dated April 1963 and was able to identify
a number of individuals appearing on this list as known to him. These
individuals would be basically FI leads and Subject indicated be was not

well acquainted enough to describe their personalities or otherwise aid
in an operational approach to them. We are listing them below, how-
ever, in the event some of them may be of specific operational interest
to SAS/F1 components. Any individuals falling into this category can be
the subject of future detailed debriefing on the occasion of my next meet-
ing with Subject.
a. Jorge SERGUERA Pivieri, also Papito, is currently
the Cuban Ambassador to Algeria. According to Subject,
SERGUERA is a homosexual.
b. Eduardo MACHADO Cartas, born about 1925 in
Lajas, Cuba, is presently employed as the Cubana Airlines
representative in Canada according to latest KUBARK
information. Subject hasn't seeing a MILACHADO for about
twenty years, but used to know him well in that he dated
MACHADO's sister and in this fashion met him and the
family.
e. Joe BARRIAL Dominguez: Subject believes this
name appearing on the KUBARRIAL list to be incorrect.
BARRIAL is listed as Charge d' Affaires, minister coun-
selor it the Cuban Embassy in Chile. Subject knew an
individual of this name who was associated with the same
revolutionary group to which Manolo CASTRO belonged.
d. Manuel PAYAN Viero is originally from Slego de
Avila, Cuba. During HATISTA's regime, PAYAN was
studying in Spain. Subject does not believe PAYAN to be
a Communist. PAYAN's wife is believed to be identical with
Maria Antonio RODRIGUEZ de Pefan who is also listed as
an employee of the Cuban Embassy in Chile.
e. Oscar PINO Santos, Cubaan Ambassador to China,
is an acquaintance of Subject. Subject was unable to provide
farther worthwhile information on PINO.
f. Flora DIAZ Parrado, born about 1910, is currently
employed as a counselor with the Cuban Embassy in France.
Subject believes that DIAZ is apolitical and has been a mam-
ber of the foreign service for a long time. He also believes

12. We asked Subject whether or not he was acquainted with any
individual belonging to the Cuban military. He could supply no signifi-
cant namer or information in this sphere. He did advise us that a
potential source for this type of information was one Eloy GUTIERUEZ
Menoyo. According to Subject, the BUREZ was formerly a Cuban
army officer and would have many companies area. As an aside,
Subject stated that GUTIERUEZ had supplied weight to Fidel CASTRO
during the 1958-59 period through an individual who has been
(fru) GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ apparently in turn obtained the was
from a (nu) SAGARO who was a resident of Santiago de Cuba. Cf. even
when the subject stated that GONZALEZ was, during this same
period, in contrast, CTO to SKORZENY in Madrid and Belgium. Sub-
ject could no longer recorded there he had heard this information and
could only add that as he remember GONZALEZ had seen SKORZENY
in Madrid and russela, Belgium, during his period. It is felt that this
piece of information my be of more than 100% more since in that we
recall having been told several years ago that SKORZENY was of opera-
tional interest to KUBARK. As we remember, SKORZENY was at that
time suspected of or reported to be the key figure in a Communist/RGB
lifegal funding apparatus. We will check with the CIG. WE, and EE,

15. UFGA 7428, 31 January 1963, contains information obtained
by JMWAVE regarding Subject and indicated him to be emotionally un-
stable, scenario, and generally reputed to be something of a nut. We
are inclined to agree with this information in so far as Subject's eco-
nomical theory. In the second, During his stay of almost one year as
an sayeise in the A: gentiun, we have a habana, Subject spent the copious
spare time available to him writing an example. On our meet-
ing with Subject on May 4th, Subject provided us with a hina.
short summary of this document. According to this summary, Subject
has been attempting to correlate economic cycles with peaks of sunspot
activity. He backs up his "economic argument" with reference to the
questionnaire of the case Calendar. If Subject has been expounding
this statement, public we are not surprised that he is considered some-
what of a nut. We have been given a letter, that many otherwise same
and useful people believe in horoscopes for similar superstitions,
We do not feel that this quirk in his personality. We have been con-
sidered derogatory in terms of his possible operational exploitation by
KUBARK. Although we have spent less than ten hours with Subject, our
impression is that he is a rational individual in terms of his attitude
towards and relationships with other individuals and personalities around
him. As a matter of fact, we obtained the impression that Subject pos-
essess more than his fair share of what is sometimes termed "common
sense". The handwritten summary of Subject's economic theory as per-
taining to counspots is appes:ed to this memorandum as attachment.
