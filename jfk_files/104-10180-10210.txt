COVER
Cover for Peter J. Di Gerveno
ACTION BIODORO: INTERMIS
1. The cover for Peter J. Di Gerveno was discussed by Robert S.
Hunkeler, Chester R. Dagnillo and the undersigned on 7 and 9 November
1967. The purpose of the conversations was to determine the most
suitable cover to be used under the broad umbrella offered by
Hunkeler's various enterprises.
2. The following conclusions were reached:
a. That Di Gerveno will come to Caracas as the
representative for some of Hunkeler's sales lines.
Specifically he will be the representative for IDENTITY-1,
which is Hunkeler's marketing firm.
b. In addition to representing THENTIY-1, generally,
he will specifically be IDENTIY-1's sales agent for IDENTIY-2;
IDENTIY-3; and IDENTIY-4 and possibly for IDENTIY-5.
The following work is to be used for a wide variety of
industrial economy. This is based in the construction industry and
as anti-corrosive coatings required by most petroleum companies
in Venezuela. Hunkeler has conducted talks with IDENTIY-6, a
large local holding company engaged in a broad variety of
enterprises. IDENTIY-6 is interested in the IDENTIY-2
line. As sales agent for IDENTIY-3, in Fig. 1, the IDENTIY-2
line is a new product of IDENTIY-6, and would not interfere with
IDENTIY-6's market or activities. Under these circumstances Di Gerveno
would enjoy a degree of immediate sponsorship by an important local
firm which should assist in the rapid solidification of his status
cover.

INTENTY- in this line of limid fortified fertilizer in which
IDENTITY- in this line of the lower, since the local fertilizer
industry is also protection in the form of inpert licensing restrictions,
it will take from one to two years of necotiation to determine whether
the GOV will permit the importation of this line. Di Gerveno would, in
conjunction with INTENTY-6, represent INTENTY-1 in the necotiation
to obtain such permission. Again, this is a major problem of the reduction of
sponsorship by the government. While the public Pi Gerveno to at least meet
the extent of government officials. While his orerational objectives
do not involve the GOV as a target, he could provide assessment and
other operational data useful against this target.
5. INTENTY-4 produces a line of concrete block manufacturing
machinery and accessories. There litting the tobacco capital
and the tobacco industry. The chemical and chemical schedule-but the number of
conjugative buyers is limited. Such a line would not of itself support
Di Gerveno's cover, but would be a satisfactory supplement there to
which would be useful in explaining the fact that he will not devote
his full time to any one activity--and to account for at least that
portion of his income which could not be justified on the basis of
his work on the sale of tobacco products.
INTENTY-5 produces wrought iron for the utility industry.
IDENTITY-1 is considering accepting representation for INTENTY-5 on
a hemisphere wide basis. If this line is accented, and Di Gerveno
represents it locally, it will also help to enhance his status and to
account for what would normally be an unusual work pattern.
7. We do not wish at this point to set into a detailed
discussion of financial arrangements. If, as we hope, 'I can't know
does make some sales, commissions, or other products. We wonder
excise the price of the product at least a proportion of these,
would favor it as an incentive to work at his cever. If not, we
have confidence that he is a well enough disciplined professional,
to work at it in any event.
8. We would expect that the operational duties we have planned
for Di Gerveno will take about 20 hours a week. This would involve
meetings with the inside case offered; meetings with the agents;
preparation of contact reports, drafts of cables, intei reports and
dispatches, by the industry think about his operations.
10. Under these circumstances, we desire that he he thoroughly
trained in his cover duties and that he have a thorough knowledge of the
products he is to sell. If it takes 6 months to train in--we expect
the 6 months to be used. As part of the training, an application of
for his PCS arrival, the new training, and training with IDENTITY-
10. We have been with and Hunkeler should visit Caracas teetheir.
ni Gerveno can be introduced by Hunkeler to his concrial contacts,
they can seek office space, and, generally, law the grecurdicr! for
hi Gerveno's PCS arrival shortly after the extornatory trin.
11. Please keep us advised on action taken, and present en this
proposal.
12. Just before the release of this dispatch we have learned of
Subject's death. This is a cause for recent--but we would like to
ask Headquarters to retain this cover needs. Rosal and to seek a possible
substitute for Di Gerveno who will have not only mood knowledge of the
Spanish language, but sufficient commercial background to fit into the
proposed cover.

NONOFFICIAL COVER REQUEST
FOR INDIVIDUAL
To insure the most effective application of nonoffleal cover, it is
essential that cover requirements be brought to the attention of Central
Cover Staff in the earliest stages of planning. As soon as it has been
determined that an agent is to be placed under nonofficial cover, either
or in the same manner as the other. The final cover is to be placed
Central Cover Staff should be arranged. (When outside recruitment of
an agent for a nonoffical cover assignment is contemplated, Central
Cover Staff facilities are available to facilitate "clean" recircumients and
other facilities. The final cover is to be placed under nonofficial cover
period.) Initial discussions will be informal and exploratory and should
result in the elimination of unsuitable cover possibilities. Central Cover
Staff, Nonofficial Cover Branch telephone extensions are 5144 and 5122.
Following the initial discussion, and based upon it, a cover require-
ment will be provided for the use of the original cover. The final cover
be submitted to Central Cover Staff. It is specifically requested that a
headquarters case officer other than the agent himself be designated
to deal with Central Cover Staff in the development of the desired non-
official cover including the preparation of the cover requirement mem-
orandum, in order to ensure that this development may proceed on a completely
objective basis. This must be given to many be keyed to the paragraphs
numbered below to obviate repetition.
No commitments will be made with any cover organization until
the final cover is to be placed under nonofficial cover. The final cover
cover and the agent's participation in the operation have been concurred
in by the field and/or the Chief of Operations, DD:P. Such memoranda
are to be signed by or for the division chief. Each agent proposed for
a nonofficial cover assignment is subject also to personal interview by a
member of the second and all Cover Staff, for assessment as to his suit-
ability for the proposed final cover. This interview, when required, will be
requested by Central Cover Staff.
At the conclusion of the discussions with the operating divisions and
discussions between the United States and the United States, the owner
agreed to the formal documents ordinarily will be prepared:
a. The first, a "Letter of Cover Instructions" addressed to the agent
will be prepared by the Central Cover Staff. It will outline exactly
the cover story to be employed and will specify what is expected
of the agent to maintain a proper relationship to the cover fa-
cilities. The final cover is to be placed under nonofficial cover
agent and/or his case officer by the Central Cover Staff case officer,
after which the agent will be required to acknowledge the receipt
of these instructions. The branch chief concerned will also be
SECRET


asked to indicate that nothing in the "Letter of Cover Instructions"
conflicts with instructs given the agent by the operating di-
vision.
. When the cover facility is a legitimate organization rather than
an Agency-controlic mechanism, a "Letter of Understanding"
with the cover organization is prepared by Contract Personnel Di-
vision. It is the "contract" with the cover organization.
The "Letter of Understanding" and the "Letter of Cover Instructions"
be submitted to the operating division for comments and concur-
ce before presentation, respectively, to the cover organization and
the agent for signature. Sanitized copies, in duplicate, of both the
tter of Cover Instructions" and the "Letter of Understanding" will
turnished the operating division-one copy of each for headquarters
nition and one for transmittal to and retention by the field station
its guidance and reference by the agent as required.

contemplate (a) continuation in a nonofficial cover status; (b)

SECRET
recruitment of new agents, penetration operation-and a state-
ment should be included as to the identities of any individuals
and organizations, in the U.S. or abroad (other than CIA staff
personnel, cover facility officials, and those listed under 2(C)
(4) above), who are or will be made wilting of agent's CIA or
U.S. Government affiliation while he is under this nonofficial cover.

The city in which the agent is to reside should be specifically
stated and alternates in order of preference should be given
3. Indicate localities outside of agent's permanent location which
agent should be free to visit and state the frequency and duration
of such visits. Also it is important to know whether or not the
time and intervals of such meetings will be determined by the
agent or dictated by influences or circumstances beyond his con-
trol.
4. Special groups agent should be able to contact
It is sometimes possible to relate a cover to a particular group
in the operational area, i.e., social, cultural, political, commercial,
If this is considered an important factor in the cover, this agent
of the requirement shall be given by the agent's organization.
5. Approximation of income which agent must be able to at-
tribute to the owner organization. Sound cover, of course, re-
quires overt (cover) explanation for a reasonable approximation
of the sum actually to be available to the agent through Agency
salary and allowances. However, a professional Intelligence
agent's qualifications frequently cannot plausibly command an
ostensible income from commercial or other laye sources
approaching his Agency income. Firm understanding should be
had relative to the agent's living within his cover income. Reser-
vation of a portion of his Agency termination may be required.
A less desirable alternative is the provision of additional cover
for income.

agent must devote to operational duties.

munication through the cover facility. If this is desired, the
justification and frequency of such communication facilities
should be Indicated.
8. Cover Suggestions

by the agent or the operating division emphasizing the agent's
special suitability to the cover suggested and or the special ad-
vantages of the cover visa-vis the target.

SECET
18 August 1967
MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/3
FROM
: Chief, WH/3/Venezuela
SUBJECT
: Assignment of Emilio Rodrigues
1. I wish to make it clear that I do not oppose
the assignment of Rodrigues per se to Venezuela, but I
do have some reservations on what he is going to be
doing. COS, Caracas intends to use him as the case
officer for the CIHAVOC and CITILT Projects. Since both
I
are basically CE/CI projects I think this is a great
approach to the U.S. Department of Labor. It is
necessarily requires a great amount of files research
which Rodrigues in his cover situation will not be
able to do. This will entail a greater amount of work
for the inside case officer, defeating the purpose for
which Rodrigues was originally considered; freeing the
insides of the U.S. Department of Labor.
2. The introduction of Rodrigues into the CIHAVOC
Case will also introduce one more step through which most
of the vital information that CIHAVOC-2 produces must
pass. For example, his info now goes through CIHAVOC-1
to the case officer. With the addition of Rodrigues
one more time consuming step will be added.
3. I am also of the firm opinion that different
case officers should be used for these operations
since both are penetrations of the same party and at
times produce similar info. In addition, both are
extremely sensitive and the compromise of one could
possess the U.S. Department of Labor.
4. If Rodrigues was assigned to Caracas for the
handling of a sensitive case which exposure would be
embarrassing to the United States, such as a high level
political penetration or a sensitive Soviet/Satellite
Case then it would be well justified. However, I feel
that his assignment as an outside case officer for
these two activities is not since they could be better
handled and serviced from the inside.

5. Finally, the cost of placing Rodrigues in the
field is not commensurate with nis planned utilization.
It will cost over $49,000 for the first year and
approximately $35,000 per year from then on. See
attached approximate schedule prepared by WH/Support.
An amount the current budget cannot easily absorb.

SECTION C - BARCAYIE COMENTS (cont'd)
wherever he has been.
Subject's l'hustic ability (bi-lingual spamisi-linging) and
his logical, orderly approach to his work are particularly effective
of the subject to clandestine communications, not only is he fully
qualified to instruct agents in SW and OWL (including; the use of numerical
and literal cipices), but the clandestine messages he prepares himself
are notable for each content, unambiguous style and concise format; other
incares less fluent in Spanish frequently consult him concerning their
own OWL or SU messages.
Although Subject of a career agent, he has functioned in a stark
capacity of the work of his tour at this Station, lacking experience
with internal procedures at the beginning, he is today itully familiar with
operational administration and support matters, and has files (operational,
administrative and production) are among the best and best complete in the
Branch. He is by nature a gregarious person but is also sol-sufficient
to an advanced degree and likes to the most important and most important
of the work of his work. He is a routine detail which could be handled
by his secretary or one of the Branch IAs but this characteristic has been
least valuable during IDY trips when circumstances have often left him
vattout the possibility of any qualified assistance, in all has work he
shows a healthy regard for operational and administrative economy and is
cost-conscious in the use of funds and material.
Subject's performance merits an exceptionally strong evaluation when
is the substantial advantage of the industry. He is already working in his grade. He
is not studying able agent handler in Cuban operations and as he
acquires broader experience, can be expected to compare equally favorably
with officers running denied area operations anywhere in the world. In
terms of personal character and professional talent, he is a fine officer,
dedicated to the work of this organization, and it has been a distinct
pleasure to have served with him.

SECTION D - 3
COMMENTS BY REVIENG OFFICIAL
The Chaff of Station has chosen to review this report
in order to underline the very high operation held by the
Station concerning the performance of the officer. The
excellent educational background, intense d votion to duty,
coprage, imaginative approach to operations, agent-mandling
ability, and his tradecraft skills have even noted in other
areas. The work of the Board of Directors of the
wissues to note that during the reporting period, need with
a number of new operational challanges and a miscable amount
of independent work in areas far resolved from the Station
Incitium, Subject has turned in an unusually strong performance.
The work of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors
being mounted into a denied area Subject demonstrated
exceptional attention to detail, a line knowledge of tradecraft,
and unusual good judgment in a number of diricult operational
situations. Thus, the reviewer fully occurs with the narrative
comments and the performance evaluations of the rating officer.

Renewal of Robert S. HUNKELER Contract
ACTOR REQUIRED - REVENUE
Action Required: As Indicated
1. The present contract with Robert S. HUNKELER expires on 31
March 1967 and the question of renewal is up for immediate treatment
and decision. The paragraphs below outline the major factors to be
considered in this matter.
2. HUNKELER is a former staff officer who resigned from WOFACT
in 1964 to establish a market research and marketing firm. He was
recontacted in the spring of 1965 and employed as an independent con-
tractor by the then COS, JINWAVE, who expressed the hope that this
relationship might set a standard for use by WOFACT of former staff
officers as long term clandestine assets and outlined HUNKELER's duties
and responsibilities as follows:
a. To provide cover for WOFACT personnel abroad.
b. Spotter and assessor of Central American consular
community in Miami.
c. Spotter and assessor of recruitment targets throughout
Latin and Central America as developed through his travels and contacts.
d. Third party recruiter and agent handler, but only in
certain carefully controlled circumstances.
3. These original concepts framing HUNKELER's activities have
continued as the major guide lines to his employment. Also added was
the task of reporting such positive and operational intelligence as he
might elicit from his contacts and associates.

4. The following summarizes the progress that was made in these
4
eas during the two year period of HUNKELER's contract status with us.
A
100% of the 100% divided for a Berlin based agent, ANTHRILL/1,
Although the agent was protected by Berlin Station, management of his
cover was competently and proactively handled by HUNKELER, HUNKELER
has continued to offer his services in the area of the 100% development
although he could provide a cover office anywhere in the Latin American
sphere, has specifically suggested Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Costa
in the 100% development in the process of opening, on his own
initiative, branch offices in the 100% development of the Dominican Republic and
again volunteered them for possible use as a "new" program. The 100% development
Station Caracas has shown some interest in taking advantage of the offer
There has been no other use by WOFACT of this HUNKELER potential during
the past two years. Such use in the future is an open question depend-
sive in part on whether WOFACT has a requirement for cover facilities
and services. The 100% development of the 100% relationship with HUNKELER
and LISA.
and LISA has met frequently with membership of the Central
Latin American consular community in the Miami area. The 100% reso-
sultions were enhanced by HUNKELER's activity and participation in
reliant international organizations concerned with business and social
relationship in the nation and North American countries. Some operational
information was gathered since these persons, but none of them ever
shaped up as a valid intelligence target worthy of further development
and recruitment. It is not expected that this target area will be of
any more interest in the future than the 100% development.
c. HUNKELER has a large number of business associates through-
out Latin America and in his travels has contacted a number of government
officials up to the presidential level. Most of these contacts have
been of a business nature. One of them, a Panamanian legislator, is of
the interest to the Panama Station. Interest in the others has been
minimally. Future prospects remain open, but must be considered as long
range.
d. There has been no use made of HUNKELER as a third party
recruiter and agent handler during his two year tenure. He has de-
clared himself always ready and willing to take on agent handling tasks,
but the Station has found it more advantageous and efficient to use
inside personnel for this. It is highly unlikely that station policy
will be a result of a new strategy.
4. HUNKELER has been on several business trips during this period.
On these occasions he was given an intelligence brief and his operation-
al expenses were defrayed by WOFACT, especially results, in terms of dissemin-
ated reports, have generally been negative;
5. Recently, HUNKELER provided an introduction to some individuals
who have a potential for use in the JUNION program. There was some
discussion of continued activity for HUNKELER in this program, but it
was the consensus that there was not sufficient promise in his contri-
bution to merit retaining him for this purpose alone. It can be ex-
pected, however, that he might, in the future, assist in entree to
other people.
5. Station JUNAVE is of the opinion that employment of Robert S.
HUNKELER has not had the results that were hoped for when the contract-
ual relationship was first established. Recognition of this was implicit
in the renegotiation of his salary scale from S4800 to S3600 per annum
of the 100% development of the first year's contract. It is also the
opinion of this Station that the 100% development of the 100% development
in the near future although it is recognized that a long range of
environment. Those statements are made without prejudice to Robert S.
HUNKELER, and the 100% market has a reasonable, willing and coop-
erative attitude in his relations with the Station representatives and
discussions of tasks and the prospects of the 100% market should
be noted that HUNKELER wants very much to retain some form of the
ship with the organization, as much for reasons of interest in the
intelligence profession an for income he might derive.

Hieadquarters Action Requested
7. To summarize it is JNAVE's view that HUNKLER's only actual
potential value to WORFECT is as a support agent to WH Division as a
whole, in supplying the official cover and possibly in spotting, develop-
ing the "SPECIAL" and JUNION assets. His value to operations of JNWAVE
Station itself will be non-existent or minimal, since there is Httle
HUNKELER can do for that Station which cannot be accomplished more
easily by a staff employee. Therefore, it is requested that Head-
quarters review this case and comment as soon as possible. The
alternatives are:
a. Renewal of contract as it is at present salary of $3600
per annum.
b. Terminate. HUNKELER has advised that he is not prepared
to accept a salary under his present level. It is suggested that the
following representative memoranda also be read in this connection:
UFGT 18719, Memorandum in Lieu of Fitness Report
UFGA 26782, Unofficial Cover Opportunity, Caracas
WFGA 26598, JUNION/Donald James Miller
UFGA 26619, HUNKELER's Office of Community, Haiti

8. The above was outlined to Robert S. HUNKELER on 15 February
1967 by his present Case Officer, Jeremy F. GEDLAND. After an object-
ive and frank discussion, HUNKELER requested that he be permitted an
opportunity to prepare a memorandum setting forth his request. He
supportunity to prepare a memorandum setting forth his Headquarters in
situation and further asked that it be forwarded to Headquarters in
conjunction with the present memorandum. The officer agreed that
he should be granted the chance to so expensive himself and to be heard
on all levels where his employment was being treated of. HUNKELER's
memorandum is attached.

ATTACHMENT TO UFGA 27019
MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Operational Review of Robert S. Hunkeler
DATE:
16 February 1967
Background:
1.
Shortly after Hunkeler resigned from KUBARK he
met with the then Chief of Station on several occasions
concerning Hunkelers potential use as a Station asset.
It was between the period following his resignation, and
before his first contract with the Station, that the COS
told Hunkeler that he was in a "cooling off period" during
which time Hunkeler should devote his energies towards the
settlement of his personal affairgrand the development of
his own business interests. Hunkeler was also told that
his value to the Station and to KUBARK would be increased
if he were free from all ties with KUBARK and ODYOE in
order that Hunkeler may be available at a later date for
KUBARK assignments. The COS did not, however, make any
commitments to Hunkeler.
Developments:
2.
During the months which followed Hunkelers resignation
he proceeded to attend to his personal affairs in Lakeland,
Florida, and established his company, Identity A, in the
WAVE area.

3.
After a number of months had lapsed, Hunkeler
was contacted by the Station COS and was recruited under
a contract in the amount of $500.00 a month plus operational
expenses. Hunkeler expressed a willingness to undertake
any assignment and a desire to actively participate in
operations. (His initial target was largely limited to
the monitoring of the activities and the personalities of
the foreign consular corp in the WAVE area and reporting
on matters of operational interest as they came to Hunkelers
attention.)
4.
Shortly after Hunkeler was placed under contract
he submitted a paper to the Station which spelled out a
number of specific tasks which he could, under the cover
of his company if required, undertake for the Station
or KUBARK. (These assignments are still compatible with
his present cover and background) There follows a list
of these tasks;
(a) Sale of KURIOT doctored parts and supplies
to the government of PBRUMEN through middlemen
and in a manner as to not disclose Hunkelers
involvement.
(b) Providing non-official cover facilities
to persons being assigned overseas and who require
a tight, realistic and flexible cover.

(c) Recruitment pitches, courier work, or
related assignments anywhere in Latin America.
(d) Monitoring of diplomatic and commercial
activities in the WAVE area.
(e) Reporting on targets of operational
interest, both in the WAVE area and in those
countries where Hunkeler visits.
(f) Spotting and assessment of specific operational
targets in the PREPRIME and in Latin America.
Review of Accomplishments:
5.
Whereas Hunkeler remained ready and willing to
travel anywhere at anytime for any KUBARK assignment, he
was advised that his long range value would be jeopardized
if he were to take operational assignments involving any
degree of risk. Hunkeler was, in his opinion, "kept in a
vacuum" as regards his being able to serve field Stations
which have not to this date been made aware of his availability
to travel except in those cases when his business travel takes
to a country and the field Station is advised of his presence
in the area.
6.
From the outset Hunkeler began to report on develop-
ments in the WAVE area and he began to work in organizations
which would permit him to penetrate the diplomatic community


- 4 -
and strengthen his operational capabilities in terms of
being able to spot and ageses Latin American political
leaders. Hunkeler got him-self appointed to a policy
making position in the Identity B, he was elected to
the position of President of Identity C, appointed to
the Board of Directors of Identity D, was elected to
the position of President of Identity E, and became a
delegate to several conferences (Panama, Jamaica and
in PEPRIME) of the Identity P.
7.
It was largely as a result of Hunkelers Latin
American oriented commercial activities and his organizational
activities that he was able to provide timely and valuable
reports on the Dominican crisis, establish a personal
relationship with Identity G and persons close to him,
spot and access several Panamanian targets, and report
on the activities and recommendations of Identity H, an
organization which provides commercial policy to the President
of Panama. (See
) Hunkeler kept the Station
up to date on the personalities and activities of the Consular
Corp in the WAVE area, and has furnished assessments and
biographic information on 12 members of this group.

8.
Other accomplishments include the following;
(a) Operational -erorting: During the last two
years Hunkeler has traveled to and submitted
operational and/or intel reports about Mexico,
the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Venezuela,
Panama and Costa Rica, in addition to reports
originating in the WAVE area.
(b) Establishment of Cover Facilities: In 1966
Hunkeler set up and maintained cover facilities
for an agent who was initially trained in Hunkelers
companies and subsequently assigned to a European
post where he remained until a person821 reduction
cut caused his termination. The cover aspects of
this cover operation, however, were tight and
professionally manged by Hunkeler. Other cover
facilities developed by Hunkeler in this period
included a cover office facility in Haiti, Venezuela
and the Dominican Republic.
(c) Other: In late 1966 Hunkeler met with an Officer
assigned to the WAVE Station for the purpose of
reviewing the operational potentials of the Caribbean.
Hunkeler was able to provide the Officer with the
names and introductions to persons well known to
Hunkeler who are now in the Caribbean or residing
in Miami and available to participate in zent, p.a.,
or informant capacities.

Present Situation:
9.
In early February, 1966, Hunkeler met with a Case
Officer of the 'racas Station who reviewed Hunkelers existing
business activities in Venezuela and who told Hunkeler that
the Caracas Station desired to use a Hunkeler company for
non-official cover purposes in Venezuela. The success
of Hunkelers commercial activities in the Dominican Republic
(and the corresponding move by Hunkeler to open an office
in Santo Domingo) is a recent development and there has not
yet been time to query Station Santo Domingo as to whether or
not they have a requirement to use Hunkelers facilities.
(Hunkeler is presently phasing out of much organizational
work in the WAVE area in order to devote more time to the
chore of setting up his operations in Santo Domingo and
Venezuela where both of his companies are currently doing
business.)
10.
There are several aspects of Hunkelers present business
activities which have not yet been finalized: He will soon
terminate his lease at his present address and has not yet
decided where to re-loate his offices; he is still in
negotiations with an investment group in Haiti and may
undertake a consultant type survey there which would provide
access to Haiti of possible interest to that Station.

Future Potentials:
11.
When Hunkelers contract was about to expire in
February, 1966, he met with a Station Officer and advised
that he was fully in accord with a salary cut from $500.00
to $300.00 a month in keeping with budgetary cuts which
were evident at that time. Moreover, Hunkeler voluntarily
ceased requesting reimbursement for operational expenses
choosing to use his KUBARK income for entertainment expenses
which of tines have operational value to KUBARK. Although he
has expressed his strong desire to continue his KUBARK
relationship under a renewal of his present contract for
$300.00 a month, he has advised that he does not care to
renew his contract for a figure of less than $300.00 a month.
