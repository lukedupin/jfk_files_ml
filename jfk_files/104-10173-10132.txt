20 December 1973
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt
1. I. phoned Paul Burns, Special Assistant to the DDO, and
said that we had some leads that could be followed by whoever has
the action in the DDO in tracking down Hunt's activities during the
fall of 1964, when he was alleged to have been engaged in surveillance
activities of Barry Goldwater.
2. I said that our files showed Hunt was in DO Division (Burns
was not familiar with that title, but recognized it as the predecessor
of FR Division) and in August 1964 was assigned to the Washington
field office. I suggested that Stan Gaines, who was Deputy Division
Chief of DO Division and now DCOs Bonn, might be in a position to
give a few groups on what Hunt was supposed to be doing then. I
suggested that he be queried by cable. Burns said Gaines is staying
on under contract for a while, so would continue to be available.
3. I said that Fig Coleman was on the Iberian desk when the
Hunt assignment to Madrid was brought up in 1964 and when Hunt
went to the field in 1965. He could give the background on the assign-
ment, which seems to have been through Karamessines at Helms'
direction. His recollection would give leads. I told him that Coleman
became. COS Madrid later, after Hunt left Spain, and could provide
information on what Hunt did not do for the Agency during that period.
I suggested that both Helms and Karamessines should be queried.
I gave as a possible press treatment that Hunt was engaged in
domestic operations (something Senator Baker is pursuing) and that
his assignment to Spain after the election could be presented as giving
him time to cool off. I thought we had to pursue the matter to be
sure we'know the facts.
4. I asked Burns to be sure that we are on information distribution
of cables to the field on this, given our assigned responsibility for
keeping files on Watergate. He said we are on the PLMMFLANK for
messages to Helms. He would advise the action officer. I said we are
available for any help we can give.

MEMORANDUM FOR: OPS/RMO
SUBJECT
: Watergate File Research - Final Report
1. The files of the immediate office of the Chief. OPS/DSG
have been checked for material relevant to the subject of this
memorandum. The check included chronological files of communi-
cations of which I was the author while assigned to Madrid, Spain
in the period July 1970 to July 1973. Nothing pertinent was found.
2. I have attempted to recollect any other details which
conceivably could be pertinent and which relate to the period
of my assignment to Madrid. The only points which I recall but
on which I have no documentation are these:
a. There were occasional. joining inquiries made of me
by American residents of Madrid about the reported presence
in Spain of E. Howard Hunt in 1972. My standard reply was
that I knew only what I had heard rumored. For the record,
at no time did Hunt contact me, and I have never known of his
having tried to contact any Station personnel in Spain during
the period 1970-73. I made no effort personally to ascertain
whether or not Hunt was in Spain, and I had no effort made by
any other person.
b. A Station officer, possibly Richard Ouderkirk, now
assigned to Guatemala, was given some information by an
informant in 1972 concerning reported activities in Spain
by Robert Vesco. I suggested that the information be given
informally to the Embassy's European Union. The
objective of the Commission was to be proposed with keeping abreast of
developments related to-Vesco. The Station did not pursue
that subject, as I recall, because it was not a topic of
reportable interest, according to requirements of the period.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General
SUBJECT:
: Howard Hunt
1. At the recent request of the Deputy Director for
Management and Services, the Office of Finance has searched
its records to determine if we could find any payment to
Mr. Hunt in an amount of approximately $30,000 that required
no accounting.
2. We have searched the following records:
a. The expense runs for the period July 1964 to
June 1973 for the immediate Office of the DCI,
the immediate Office of the Staff,
C1 Staff, CA-Staff and the Office of Security.
We have checked the funds items that were re-
flected in the average expense records but have
identified the thing relating to Mr. Hunt.
b. The Madrid Station, JNAAVE and FR/Washington
Office of Accountings to determine if there were
the passed by the Stations to Mr. Hunt during
the year he served under non-official cover in
Madrid. We could find no payment to Mr. Hunt
either in his true name or his two identified
pseudonyms.
c. Mr. Hunt's travel claims for the period
1960-1972 and have found nothing in these
travel claims that were not consistent with
normal travel expenses, i.e., transportation,
per diem.
d. We made a specific analysis of Mr. Hunt's
advance account for the period he was under
non-official cover (July 65-Sept '66) and have
E2 INPDET
CL BY: 006567

SECRET
SUBJECT: Howard Hunt
determined that $33,500 was advanced to him
for travel and transportation of household
goods to and from Madrid with one trip to
Paris for he and the country. The
U.S. Department of All of this advance was fully
accounted for. However, in his accounting,
one item appeared unusual. It was an
expenditure of $1,600 for a sensitive
operation which was approved for write-off by Mr.
Desmond Fitzgerald on 1 June 1966 without
further accounting.
3. Also, we confirmed that no other Agency advance accounts
were established for Mr. Hunt during this period.
4. At the beginning of his non-official cover tour, it
was necessary to establish a bank account in his name. The
EUR Division accordingly was a third in account at the
Chase Manhattan Bank in Mr. Hunt's name to receive all non-
salary payments. (Mr. Hunt`had an account at Riggs National
Towco receive his salary and allowance payments). The
following deposits were made to the account during 1965 and
1966:
Account opened: 13 July 1965
13 July 1965
$10,000
22 July 1965

15 September 1965
5,000
6 October 1965
5,000
19 July 1966
5,000
$30,000
All of the above have been accounted for by submission
of travel and transportation accountings.
5. We feel at this time without specific guidelines that
further searching would be somewhat fruitless. One strange
aspect of the non-official cover assignment in Madrid is that
all the costs were charged to the support allotment of the
EUR Division which is not normal as non-official cover people
are usually assigned to a project. It is unusual to have a
case officer abroad for one year on an appraisal assignment
without hin incurring operational expenditures.

6. The Office of Finance has not found operational
expenditures except for the $1,600 mentioned above.
Therefore, it is suggested that Mr. Karanessines be questioned
as to a project or projects to which Mr. Hunt's operational
expenditures if incurred would have been charged.
7. Another possible course of action is to request the
Director to approve my asking a cleared contact at Chase
Manhattan Bank to provide a transcript of all entries into
Mr. Hunt's Chase Manhattan Bank account.
8. We are currently reviewing records of all cashier's
checks prepared and issued by Monetary to determine if any
were payable to Mr. Hunt's Hopefully this effort will be
finished by the end of the week.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt
1. I spoke with Fig Coleman about Hunt's assignment to Spain.
I.had spoken with him back in August when we were inquiring into
reported activities involving Mrs. Hunt.
2. Coleman said that he got out of the War College in May 1964
(by which he fixed-the time), and took over the Iberian desk. Bill
Ryan was C/EUR (or was it WE Division at the time). In early autumn
Ryan said that he had just been-informed by the DDP (Karamessines)
that Hunt was to be assigned to Madrid as DCOS, as a directed assign-
ment by Helms. A memo was prepared and sent to the COS, Jim Noel
(now retired). There was nothing further for about a month when Ryan
called Coleman in and showed him a RYBAT letter from Noel stating
that Ambassador Stanley J. Woodward would not have Hunt in the
Embassy.
3. Woodward had been the Ambassador to Uruguay when Hunt
was COS Montevideo. He had a low opinion of Hunt and was counting
the days until Hunt left. The President of Uruguay visited President
Eisenhower in the States, at which time he requested a personal favor-
that Hunt be reassigned to Montevideo. So Hunt took another tour.
Woodward was outraged, and had his revenge in 1964 when Hunt was
to be sent as DCOS to Madrid.
4. After a couple of months--early 1965--Ryan called Coleman
in and, observing that there was more than one way to skin a cat,
told him that Hunt was going to Spain under nonofficial cover. This
didn't require anything special, Ryan saying that he didn't know
much about it. It came to him from Karamessines on Helms' order.
Hunt was to have the telephone number of the COS, but he would do
nothing for the station. Hunt was to submit administrative vouchers
for reimbursement of his expenses and they were to be paid. Coleman
said he never saw Hunt before he went out. He knows that there was
no operational reporting, to indicate that Hunt was doing anything.


14/00000
The vouchers were not large, although the documentation was poor.
Colcman raised the question with Ryan about his signing off, and
Ryan said he could talk to Karamessines if he wished. Decause
Coleman had a close personal.association with Karamessines he
did just that. He was told by Karamessines that he didn't know much
about it either--Heims said send him out, " He was instructed to go
ahead.
5. In early July 1966 (4 July) Coleman went to Madrid. He
had a ten day turnover with Jim Noel. Hunt had already gone and
he did not see him. Noel said he didn't know what Hunt did, but
that Coleman need not worry because he was gone.
6. Several months ago Noel was at a seminar at which
Ambassador Woodward was also present. At the time he asked
about Hunt. Woodward said it might still be dragged into the press;
Tad Szulc hid been after Woodward about the Hunt assignment to
Spain. Coleman observed that Szulc did have a long article on Hunt
in the New York Times, and the Spain assignment was mentioned,
but without any conclusions as to its significance.
7. Coleman said the RYBAT file of C/EUR may have something on
the event, but not much. A letter out and the reply, but not much more.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt--Madrid Assignment
1. On 22 February 1974, Mr. Frederick N. Evans
and the undersigned interviewed Mr. Edward Ryan,
Chief, Staff D, Deputy Director for Operations, on
the subject of Mr. E. Howard Hunt. During the period
of Mr. Hunt's assignment as a Contract A agent
to Madrid between July 1965 and September 1966, Mr.
Ryan had been the Director of the Department of
Divertor and the Director for Plans. The purpose of
the interview was to determine if Mr. Ryan had any
information bearing on the matter of the operational
assignment of Mr. Hunt during this period.
2. Mr. Ryan stated that the assignment of Mr.
Hunt both to the European Division and to Madrid was
handled without benefit of the routine processing
procedures through the Western European Division.
Mr. Ryan was a member of the Department of
by Mr. Thomas Karamessines, the Assistant Deputy Director
for Plans. With regard to operational duties, Mr. Ryan
was unaware of any specific project or target for Mr.
Hunt. Mr. Ryan made the specific observation that if
Mr. Hunt produced positive intelligence on the Iberian
target during this period the officials responsible
for this effort within the Western European Division
were totally unaided.
Mr. Ryan stated that most of his knowledge of
Mr. Hunt's activity and the nature of his assignment
during this period came more through heavsay than
direct official knowledge. For example, he cited the
comment nade by a mutual acquaintance of his and Mr.
Hunt's to the effect that Mr. Hunt stated that while
in Madrid he was going to "play golf and write books."
Mr. Ryan was asked specifically whether or not he was


14-00000
under the impression that Mr. Hunt's written activities
were either being encouraged or subsidized directly
by this Agency in any official effort. M. Ryan re-
sponded that he was personally not aware of any such
arrangement. He added as an expression of personal
opinion that Mr. Hunt had no operational function and
was simply granted the opportunity to write books for
his own personal gain at Government expense during this
period.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Conversation with Sam Halpern
1. I met with Sam Halpern for about 20 minutes this morning
in CG10, where he is cleaning up some details before he goes to
his new assignment as DC/DCD. I told him generally about our
attempt to reconstruct Howard Hunt's assignments and financial
transactions, and asked him particularly for recollections he may
have of Hunt's assignment in Spain in mid-1965 to the fall of 1966.
2. Halpern said that he has no recollection about such an
assignment. In June.1965 he moved from WH Division with Des
FitzGerald when he became the DD/P. At about that time
Halpern's father died and he was in New York for the funeral
and ten days of religious observations following that. He was back
in mid-June and in and out from then on as he got ready to attend
the National War College which began in August. He did not return
to that office until the end of June 1966.
3. Halpern observed that during this period Karamnessines
was ADDP with Helms moving up to be DDCI. He thought it entirely
possible that Helms and Karamessines could have handled this
on their own.
4. Halpern said that Evan Parker had come into the office
of the DD/P shortly before Helms became DDCI, and had returned
from Honolulu for that purpose. He stayed on for FiteGerald until
Halpern returned from the National War College, He suggested
someone might talk to Evan Parker who may have known something
about it (although he may not). He also suggested talking to Georgia.

MEMORANDUN FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Watergate--Frank A. O'Malley
1. At 3 p.m. on the afternoon of 19 February 1974,
Mr. Frederick N. Evans and Lawrence J. Howe interviewed
Mr. Frank A. O'Malley at his residence, 6419 Lakeview
Drive, Falls Church, Virginia. Mr. O'Malley retired
from this Agency in June of 1972. Prior to retirement
Mr. O'Malley was an officer in the External Employment
Assessment Committee, retirement Activities Division of
Associate Office of Personnel, and was a member of the
position
to assist personnel retiring from this Agency in finding
post-retirement employment. In this capacity Mr. O'Malley
had been instrumental in the placement of Mr. E. Howard
Hunt in the Robert R. Mullen public relations firm. The
purpose of this interview was to attempt to determine if
additional information could be developed from Mr. O'Malley
with regard to the placement of Mr. Hunt with the Mullen
Company.
2. Mr. O'Malley began the interview by recalling
the nature of his past Agency associations both with Mr.
Hunt and the Mullen Company. Mr. O'Malley stated that
prior to assuming his responsibilities in the Office of
Personnel he had served with Central Cover Staff in the
American Association. Mr. O'Malley was a member of its
In this capacity he had become familiar with the activi-
vities of Mr. Hunt while Mr. Hunt functioned on the Covert
Activities Staff primarily in the propaganda field. Mr.
O'Malley stated that he first came in contact with the
Secretary of the Board of Directors, along to find an organi-
zation to handle the public relations and the other part
Agency activity known as the Free Cuba Committee. Mr.
O'Malley related that he had arranged this cover through
the Christianform Organization and that his duties in-
volved all aspects of the funding of this activity. Mr.
O'Malley described the nature of his working relationship


14/00/00
with Mr. Robert R. Mullen as being close and cordial.
Mr. O'Malley stated that Mr. Mullen was in the habit
of confiding to him information concerning other Mullen
business contacts and projects. In response to a
specific question, Mr. O'Malley stated that during the
period of the year, Mr. O'Malley the Mullen Company dealing
with the Free Cuba Committee. Mr. Mullen told him the
However, Mughes Organization was a member of the

that Mr. Hunt was referred to his office for placement
assistance through the Office of the Executive Director,
then Colonel L. K. White. Mr. O'Malley stated that in
view of Mr. Hunt's interests in the public relations
with Mr. Robert Mullen. Mr. O'Malley was to put Mr. Hunt in touch
with Mr. Robert Mullen for the time to be successful in
benefit of Mr. Mullen's guidance. Mr. O'Malley recalled,
after the initial meeting, Mr. Mullen mentioned having
met Mr. Hunt some years previously in Paris, France.
Mr. O'Malley was a new ranged interviews with various
organizations including the Mullen and Mullen's department
Copper Company. Through the offices of the Mullen Company
an interview was arranged with the General Foods Corpora-
tion, a Mullen client. Mr. O'Malley stated there was
"the need for the development of the successful in
"selling himself" during any of these interests. Mr. Mhat
no job offers had resulted. In response to a question
as to whether or not executive level interest was still
being shown in Mr. Hunt's post-employment placement,
Mr. Mullen. Mr. Mullen. Mr. Mullen. Mr. Mullen
Director of Central Intelligence, was listed as a. charac-
ter reference on Mr. Hunt's resume and that Mr. Helms
signed a letter of recommendation to the Kennecott Copper
Company and Mr. Hunt's behalf. Mr. O'Malley recalled being
contacted to the Mullen and Mr. Mullen. Mr. Mullen. Mr. M
Mr. Mullen, who stated that a decision had been actively
expand their operations. In view of this expansion, Mr.
Mullen had decided he would himself offer Mr. Hunt a job.
Mr. Mullen had stated that he was interested in having Mr.
Hunt begin work immediately. However, Mr. O'Malley re-
called that Mr. Hunt completed retirement formalities and
actually started work for the Mullen Company approximately
: Week to 10 days later.

A. Mr. O'Malley stated that conicct was maintained
with Mr. Hunt while at the Mullen Company on a continuing
basis, because Mr. O'Malley was interested in Mr. Hunt
for possible referral of the Council. Mr. O'Malley
O'Malley also understood that there was Cover and Con-
mercial Staff interest in the Mullen Company, and that
Mr. Hunt became instrumental in discussing several aspects
of the cover operations in his capacity as an officer of
the Council. Mr. O'Malley recalled referring various
Agency officers to Mr. Hunt for guidance when these indi-
viduals expressed an intent in entering the public
relations field. Mr. O'Malley could recall disappointment
in feeling Mr. Hunt had genderly been less helpful on
these occasions.
5. Mr. Hunt contacted Mr. O'Malley on several occasions
request that the of retiring Agency oversees with
specific qualifications. These instances were approved appen-
ly after Mr. Hunt had assumed his responsibilities with
the White House. In one instance Mr. Hunt requested re-
feral of a recently retired Agency secretary. As re-
previous memoranda and discussions, Mr. O'Malley was unable
to recall the name of this individual. He did, however,
the committee would be asked to be asked to down the
individual whom he referred. As a point of claim for
Mr. O'Malley said that this individual had not previously
been known to Mr. Hunt, nor had she previously worked
for him in any capacity. Mr. O'Malley also recalled a
decision to make the committee with the Committee on
the area of locks and surreptitious entry. As a result
Mr. Thomas C. Amato was provided to Mr. Hunt at that time.
It is Mr. O'Malley's recollection that Mr. Hunt specifically
applied that a person with Mr. Amato's qualifications was
needed to be asked to be asked to be asked to be asked to
Hughes Organization in Las Vogas, Nevada. Mr. O'Malley
stated the opinion that it was his impression that the
duties involved would include the monitoring of a listening
device in an undisclosed location. Mr. O'Malley reiterated
his understanding that Mr. Amato did not accept Mr. Hunt's
offer of employment.
6. Mr. O'Malley then recalled request from Mr. Hunt
for a recommendation of a security service organization
to carry out an electronic countermeasures "sweep.' Mr.
O'Malley recommended the Mackenhut Corporation. Mr.
3


14-00000
O'Malley recalled that Mr. Hunt expressed dissatisfaction
with that suggestion in part because of that in
viewed as that firm's political orientation. Mr. O'Malley
did not elaborate further on that remark. Mr. O'Malley
then suggested the use of Anderson Security Consultants,
Incorporated, a commercial cover entity of the Office of
Security. Mr. O'Malley stated that insofar as this
issue, Mr. O'Malley was not a member of the purposes and that
Mr. Hunt could be assured of the reliability of the
vices, he felt this to be a reasonable suggestion. Mr.
O'Malley stated that during a subsequent phone call when
Mr. O'Malley asked how his suggestion had worked out,
Mr. O'Malley said that Mr. O'Malley was not a fine job. The
At this point Mr. O'Malley was asked whether he was from
his associations with Mr. Hunt he felt Mr. Hunt was in
the habit of making glib comments which were not neces-
sarily accurate in order to pass over a subject. Mr.
O'Malley said that Mr. O'Malley was categorically so. He said
he was sure that Mr. Hunt had not to be a result of
occasions and that, therefore, he was in no position to
be sure that Mr. Hunt had actually, in fact, used the
services of Anderson Security Consultants. Mr. O'Malley
volunteered the opinion that he suspected the electronic
countermeasures "sweep" was to be carried out in the offices
of the Committee of the House.
Mr. O'Malley responds to a question as to whether he had
ever referred anyone to McCord Associates, Mr. O'Malley
replied that he remembered having referred Walter Brayden.
Mr. Brayden for a time acted as bodyguard to Mrs. Martha
Mitchell. As an aside Mr. O'Malley mentioned that Mr.
Brayden had refused to carry a firearm in spite of the
"referred" of the following: "The fact that the authority
ity of the Attorney General. Asked specifically that he had
ever referred either William Shea or Teresa Shea to Mr.
McCord, Mr. O'Malley stated that he did not recall specif-
ically referring Teresa Shea and that he was sure that he
had not referred William Shea to him. So, contrary to
previous statements, it is now Mr. O'Malley's belief that
in all probability Mrs. Shea was not referred by this
Agency to Mr. McCord.

8. Ret..ning to Mr. O'Malley's p. rious responsibilities
in coordinating funding for the covert action activities
of Mr. E. Howard Hunt, the issue was raised as to whether
or not the funding of Mr. Hunt's projects continued between
the 1966 and September 1966 while Mr. Hunt was a contract
employee in the next year. The Committee was called
that at the time of Mr. Hunt's assignment to Mardid
statement disseminated for consumption within the Agency
was that Mr. Hunt was retiring. Mr. O'Malley stated that
the Committee will be believed. Mr. O'Malley was quite
certain that during the 1966 period, and the Committee
project funding for Mr. Hunt. In response to specific
question Mr. O'Malley stated that on Mr. Hunt's return to
staff employment the projects and funding which stopped in
July 1965 were again resumed. Mr. O'Malley was not aware
of any project names or funding mechanisms or post-assignment
accountings in connection with Mr. Hunt's activities in
Madrid.

3. A review of the circunstances surrounding Mr.
Hunt's conversion to Contract Type A employment and
assignment was then undertaken by Messrs. Yalo, Caufiold,
Hudson and the undersignature of the United States,
and the United States reviewed for possible indications
of the nature of the operational activity undertaken in
Madrid. A review of travsl vouchers indicated that Mr.
Hunt and his family made accountings indicating departure
from Washington, D. C., on S August 1965 with an arrival
of the United States. The Department of the National
travel were charged to the budget of the Western Hemi-
sphere Division, Deputy Directorate for Plans, Madrid
Station Support account. A subsequent accounting sum-
marized PCS travel expenses and included a payment for
apartment rental for 16, 17 and 18 August 1965 with a

Bank of New York City. A review of all payments made to
Mr. Hunt through the Chase bank account through Mr. Hunt's
operational advance subsidiary account, or 14.42 account,
had teen made. There was no record of any operational
account. The Department of the National Trust, the Sen-
Mr. Yala stated that this fact defined his concern. He
felt that it was inconceivable that Mr. Hunt could have
undertaken operational activity without some transfer of
or accounting for funds. To date, no such records have
been made to Mr. Hunt. The Department of the National
dixrash or operational FAN number has been located. Al
expenses connected with Mr. Hunt identified to date were
charged to the Madrid Station Support. A review made of
Madrid Station records has not indicated any "Developmental
Committee" of the National Trust and the Department of the
tional Activity (00A)" funds expended by or on behalf of
Mr. Hunt. These two accounts would normally be the source
of operational funding not charged against a specific pro-
ject activity.

for S. A coyow of all of the traysl vouchers on record
a project. In addition to the PCS and return vouchers,
two other accountings are on record. One accounting
covered a trip to entire Hunt family to Paris "for
the renoval of visas." The number of voucher covered a TDY
trip from Madrid to Washington wille turn to Madrid

the travel order number - "no travel order." The account-
ing was approved and signed by Mr. Thomas Karamossines,
then Deputy Director for Plans. No justification or
statement of Purpose for this TDY was given on the account-
ing.
The Rale deternained that further review of possible
sources. Mr. Identification of operational funding was in
order. Mr. and gave instructions that the entire 1442
advance account must be reviewed for other possible
channels of funding outside of the New York Chase account.
After discussion, it was agreed that particular attention
be taken to any items connected with publishing or book
royalties. Mr. Yala noted that the royalty offset waver
provision amended to Mr. Hunt's contract was, in his ex-
perience, somewhat unusual.
Mr. Yala was informed by the undersigned of the
intention of the New Mr. Edward Ryan, currently Chief,
Division D. who was a member of Mr. Hunt's Madrid assign-
ment, Deputy Chief of the Waste Commissioner Division. Mr.
Yala suggested that Mr. Davis Powell was interviewed.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Interview of Mr. Rogers Brooks
on the David St. John Novels
1. At 0930 on the morning of 15 February 1974,
the undersigned interviewed Mr. Rogers Brooks, Chief
Contract Personnel Division, Office of Personnel.
The purpose of this interview was to determine if Mr.
Brooks had any information not contained in the Con-
tract Personnel file of Mr. E. Howard Hunt on the
latter's activities while a Contract Type A employee.
2. Mr. Brooks summarized his recollections by
5371, and Mr. Brooks, who had been working
was not entirely unusual for highly sensitive contracts
to be administered without the contracting officer being
made aware of the operational objective involved. Mr.
Brooks stated that he recalls some of the controversy
and the use in preparing the contract dealing with the
question that the contract was aware, but he was
unable to recall any of the details. He was Mr. Brooks'
suggestion that the Office of Finance to contacted and
that their contract personnel records on Mr. Hunt be
checked for information.

MENORANDUN FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Interview with Mr. Raymond A. Rocca
on the David St. John Novels
1. On the morning of 14 February 1974 Messrs.
Frederick Evans and Lawrence Howe interviewed Mr. Raymond
A. Rocca, Deputy Chief, Counter Intelligence Operations.
The purpose of the interview was to follow up on infor-
mation contained in Office of Security files which stated
the belief that individuals in the Counter Intelligence
Operations office had knowledge of the writing activities
of Mr. E. Howard Hunt. This belief was a matter of record
in the files of the former Security Research Staff and was
attributed to Mr. Paul Gaynor, now retired, and Mr. Edward
Smyles.
2. During this interview Mr. Rocca was specifically
asked whether or not he had knowledge of the existence of
any form of official sponsorship or encouragement to Mr.
E. Howard Hunt to write novels to improve the image of
the interview. He said, "I think that the most important
or not any assistance was ever requested of the Counter
Intelligence Operations office to be provided to Mr. Hunt
or whether or not that staff had ever had any relationship
with Mr. Hunt whatsoever. In response to these questions
about the current and future of the American Society's degree
of any such arrangements nor at any time was he party to any
assistance or any requests for assistance to Mr. Hunt. Mr.
Rocca stated that the particular section which he had been
most actively concerned in the past years was responsible
for the use of the American Society's office in the
of "setting the record straight." In this sense, the "image"
mission of the office was to counter misinformation cur-
renily in the media or otherwise believed to be part of an
adoption of the American Agency. Mr. Rocca foals that any
assumption that Mr. Hunt was to be a very complex agency
sponsored image activity would have probably lead to the
conclusion that it was done under the Counter Intelligence
Operations. However, Mr. Rocca emphatically stated that
this was not the case.

3. Mr. Rocca was thoroughly candid and cooperative
during the course of this interview. He was unable to
suggest alternate means of attempting to determine if
any official Agency sponsorship of Mr. Hunt did in fact
exist. Mr. Rocca did venture the opinion that he felt
that in all probability an official acquiescence on the
part of senior officials might have been involved rather
than the fact that the fact that the majority all in
this discussion that the nature of any informal support
given to Mr. Hunt would be far more difficult to define
in the absence of any formalized agreements.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Possible Agency Sponsorship of the
David St. John Novels
1. The dotalls summarizing an interview on 4 February
1973 with Mr. Walter Pferrhelmer, Curator, Historical
Intelligence Collection, were set forth in a memorandum
on the letter of the 1973. He told him dated 6 February 1974. Mr.
Xuhn was briefed by the undetected by the 1974. Mr. Kuhn
during the afternoon of 5 February 1974. Later the same
afternoon, at Mr. Kuhn's direction, a conference was held
with Messrs. Scott Breckenridge and John Richards of the
Office of the Inspector General.
2. During this conference, the speculation was entertained
that Mr. E. Howard Hunt had, for instance, been under Agency
of the 1973, Mr. Kuhn, a group of Mr. Richard Hoins in his
preparation of a series of spy novels under the pseudonym,
David St. John If it can be accepted as a reasonable
supposition that Mr. Hunt had some highly compartmental
for the 1973, Mr. Kuhn, a group of the 1973, Mr. Kuhn
is a rite these books, then it is likely that this relation-
ship continued after Mr. Hunt officially retired. It is
specifically noted that Mr. Hunt retired 30 April 1970.
Subsequent to the retirement, a David St. John book appeared
in print in 1971 and another in 1972. These manuscripts
were apparently prepared by the 1972. That Mr. Hunt was
enjoised that Mr. Hunt, a Philip Morris, a legalist.
1. Minutes from the Office of the 1974 Counsel make
references to a concorn of Senator Baker over an allsged
financial relationship between Mr. Helms and Mr. Hunt
which continued subsequent to Mr. Hunt's formal retirement.
Senator Baker has reportedly made reference to a payment
of some thirty thousand dollars with the paronthetical
comment that Mr. Helms would not have that amount of money

to provide Mr. Hunt from his private funds. Mr. Richards
of the Inspector General Staff opinioned that if the
Agency had sponsored the St. John books, it was likely
that Mr. Hunt had so informed Senator Baker.
4. Adding possible weight to this line of speculation
is the fact that subsequent to publishing the last St. John
novel, Mr. Hunt published a novel entitled, Eduardo, using
his. old Agency issued alias, Edward J. Hamilton. The
suggestion is that this writing effort was done by Mr. Hunt
free of any fiduciary relationship with the Agency involved
in the use of the St. John pen name.
5. Mr. Howard J. Osborn, Director of Security, was
briefed on the above by the undersigned in the presence of
Mr. Tuhn on the evening of 5 February 1974.

subsequent copyright applications were submitted without
the address. Mithin five minutes of the conversation with-
Mr. Karacassines, Mr. Pforzheimer recalls being called by
Mr. Richard Hoims, then Deputy Director of Central Intelligence.
Mr. Pforheimer recalls the substance of the conversation as
being. "Forzheimer's death, this is the first book to
come along with the second year. I good about the Agency. "Why
not like the Goddamn thing?
3. The undersigned asked Mr. Pforzheimer, who to his
knowledge, would be in a position to confirm or deny whether
Mr. lllunt was under any form of Agency sponsorship in his
workplace. Mr. Pforzheimer explained the results.
That he was never officially briefed by Mr. Pfortheimer replied
only Mr. Hoims or Mr. Karamessines could provide the answer.
Mr. Pforzheimer was then asked if either Mr. Angleton or Mr.
Rocca of Counter Intelligence Operations would have any
knowledge of this activity. Mr. Pforzheimer replied that he
doubtly said:
4. Mr. Pforzheimer went on to relate that he was
occasionally tasked to do research for Mr. Hunt. He recalled
on one occasion being asked to research the Indian religious
fites involving use of funeral pyres. Mr. Pforzheimer
remembered that this theme figures significantly in Mr. Hunt's
question. Mr. Pforzheimer was a "which appeared under the
St. John pen name in 1966. Mr. Pforheimer parenthetically
pointed out the origin of the pen name as being the names of
Mr. Hunt's two sons--David and St. John.
5. Tracing Mr. Hunt's career assignments, it is noted
that he was assigned to the Office of the Deputy Director
for Operations then designated, the DDP/Operations Group, in
the 1966, Mr. Pforheimer, and Mr. Pforzheimer, was a member
during 1965. From June 1965 through September 1966, Mr. Hunt

any indication that any of the David St. John manuscripts were
ever submitted for review in accordance with Agency regulations.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Kuhn
SUBJECT: General Gaynor's Recollections
1. This date, at your instruction, I called Gen. Paul F. Gaynor
to seek his recollections regarding his knowledge of the writings of
Mr. Hunt and any official who might be aware of the circumstances
of any Agency involvement in that effort.
2. Gen. Gaynor advised that his memory is not altogether clear
on the matter, and that he was "reaching, " but stated that has he
reconstructs the matter:
a. He became aware that Hunt, while in WH, was accomplishing
a steady flow of spy books, and that security approval was not being re-
quested on the manuscripts before submission to publishers. (He stated
that this activity continued later, as he recalls it, in CI Staff, and
agreed with idea that the volume of writings was sufficient to indicate
that a great of time was involved in Hunt's writing.) Gen. Gaynor advised
that he raised the issue "up front" on several occasions. The reaction
he received to his raising the issue was that "Keep your stinking nose out
of this business. " He stated that he was lead to believe that Mr. Helms
desired to improve the image of the intelligence profession and the Agency
and that Hunt's books were a part of the program to do so. He stated that
he was never told outright that this was the case, but the responses he
received lead him to believe this was the case.
b. He suggested that two people might be able to assist in clearing
the issue, Ray Rocca and Walter Piorheimer, both of whom were involved
in the "image" materials. He stated that Piorheimer seemed to be aware
of the details - on an up to date basis - of Hunt's departure from the
Agend, he said that public relations firm, to the other party, and the
gained the belief that he was not going to bring his desk outside the building,
but being paid by the same source as before. He also advised that he kept
Miss Ethel Mendoza fairly current on what he was learning about Hunt's
activities because she followed the case for him, and suggested that her
recall about what he had learned and when and what resulted, might be
better than his at this date. (He also mentioned an incident in which Morse
Allen while on a TDY was told by a COS to ask Headquarters to remove Hunt
from the Ares because of his direct liaison with the president of the country,
and other activities which were confounding station operations. Later, the COS
told Morse to forget about relaying the message, with the implication that
trent was being directed by higher authority in the Agency and the COS did not
wish to set in the middle by complaining. He said Morse would probably

c. He also suggested that another person--definitely no friend of
Hunt--who might have some recall or have picked up information about
the book-writing matter might be Anita Potocki of CI Staff, formerly of
Division D. (I gather that she did not have official knowledge, but because
of her dislike for Hunt, she made it somewhat her business to follow his
career. )

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Contract Personnel Division
SUBJECT:
Terence S. CRABANAC - Retention of
Royalties by a Contract Employee
1. You have requested the opinion of this Office in regard to
the retention of future royalties which might be earned by Terence S.
CRABANAC as a result of his literary efforts. We believe that he is
entitled to retain such royalties without an offset against his Agency
salary.
2. We have been advised by Mr. Gene Stevens, WE/Support, that
CRABANAC's cover does not includes the role of a writer; CRABANAC's
cover for status will only be a light one of a retired. Foreign Service
Officer. Therefore, paragraph 7 of his contract dated 4 July 1965 may
remain as written. Royalties from the fictional works that he writes as
a profitable hobby will not be emoluments received from or through his
"cover activities."

1. Reference is made to the telephone conversation
of 25 July 1965 between yourself and Rogers C. Brooks of

a field wherein he has an already demonstratad talent based

of the preparation of Mr. CrabanaC's contract, the specific
detail of his cover was unknown.
3. Request your opinion in regard to the retention of
possible royalties earned by CrabanaC as a result of his
literary efforts or whether such income should be properly
offset.
