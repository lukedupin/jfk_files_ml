MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Career Management Group
SUBJECT:
Promotion of Mr. Calvin W. Hicks
1. I would solicit Career Management Group and the Promotion Panel
to consider the overall career of Calvin W. Hicks when deciding on the cur-
rent cycle of promotions from GS-13 to GS-14.
2. After Mr. Hicks EOD in 1950, he advanced rapidly in three years
to GS-11. He was promoted to GS-12 in 1956, six years later to GS-13 in
1962, and since then has been almost 12 years in grade. He has had over-
seas tours with FE and NE Divisions, has served as a training Instructor, on
a PM task force, and with Miami Ops and area branches in WH. In these
assignments he consistently received Strong ratings. Despite a largely para-
tional study, he has been a professor of students from the University of
and developed the skills of an operations officer doing operations-oriented
reports work in the Intelligence Watch. As of this date he has the longest
continuity in the Intelligence Watch and is rated as a mature and thoughtful
individual who exercises excellent professional judgment. He was recom-
mended for promotion from GS-13 to GS-14 in April 1968 and in April 1969.
In 1970 he was recommended for a GSI by: FI Chief, Peer desIiva. He was
again recommended for promotion in March 1971, in November 1972, and in
November 1973.
3. Admittedly, promotions are competitive and the rankings are rela-
tive and must be adjusted to the headroom available. The overall history of
his career would seem to argue the equity of granting the often recommended
promotion to Mr. Calvin Hicks as he nears the end of a career. Mr. Hicks is
49 years old and has a family of five children. He has a medical hold which
will not allow him to serve overseas at this time and he therefore, contem-
plates retirement at age 50 (in late 1974). He is and will be until then a
valuable member of the Intelligence Watch.
4. I recommend that the promotion which has escaped him in the last
decade be granted at the time of this year's promotion cycle.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Career Management Group
Mid-Career Officer Branch
SUBJECT
:
Reccmendation for the Promotion of Calvin W. Hicks. (056361)
to GS-14
1. I would again like to recommend the promotion of subject officer from
GS-13 to GS-14. Mr. Hicks has been with the Intelligence Watch since June 1967
and his performance has been characterized consistently by exceptional proficiency.
He serves on a rotating schedule with seven other officers doing identical work,
some of whom are currently in GS-14.
2. A medical hold has precluded any further overseas assignments and for
this reason his stay in. W has been extended until November 1974, when he will
be 50-years-old at which time he plans to retire under the Agency retirement
system.
3. Mr. Hicks' resourcefulness and ability to apply the multitude of
reporting instructions and techniques have been convincingly demonstrated in
crisis situations such as the recent Chilean coup and the Middle-Eastern crisis.
He has consistently displayed initiative and good judgment in meeting unforeseen
crisis with rapid and effective action and has clearly demonstrated his ability
to continuously adjust to rotating shifts and the irregular flow of traffic.
4: For his sustained high level of performance in 1972 Mr. Hicks received
a quality step increase in recognition and as proof of the high esteem in which
he is held by his superiors. He occupies a GS-14 slot. His promotion is again
recommended in recognition of his long years of Agency service.

1. The officers of the Intelligence Watch (IW) performed

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Foreign Intelligence Staff
SUBJECT
Intelligence Watch Assistance to
European Division
1. As I am preparing to leave the European Division,
a note of appreciation is in order for the sorvices rendered
to us for the four years of my tenure hero by the officers
of the Intelligence Watch.
2. At a time of increasingly complicated intelligence
collection and reporting problems, our Agency has come of
a long time to recognized that information often cannot be
allowed to be made in the area of the industry. The
must be able to respond to national needs and world events
round the clock. The Intelligence Watch, more than any
other single institution, has made it possible for us to
ensure that the information that its cooperation particularly
under strained reporting conditions are being Presidential.
trips abroad, for instance -- but have allowed the
presence and judgment helpful at other times. I know that
my staff relied on IV extensively.
3. I am making a point of recognizing this because
the Intelligence Watch -- a bit like our Agency as a whole --
is apt to be the attention with an occasional slip than
the record of continuing accomplishment and success in
scoping with problems from what I have been able to observe,
the job has been well done.
4. I hope you will bring this memorandum to the
attention of those concerned.

MENORANDUM FOR: Chairman; DDP QSI and Honor and Merit
Awards Panel
SUBJECT
:
Request for Quality Step Increase
Mr. Calvin W. HICKS, GS-13 (056361)
1. I recommend that a Quality Step Increase be
awarded to Mr. Calvin W. Hicks.
2. Mr. Hicks is one of three officers in the Intel-
ligence Watch, FI Staff, on whom identical recommendations
are being submitted. These officers, all in grade GS-13,
which are not a member of the Board of Directors, is
identical to that done in the same office by five other of-
ficers, GS-14 and 15, and all three have been rated "Strong."
3. The Intelligence Watch is the primary intelligence
dissemination office of the Clandestine Service. Its out-
put of over 2,000 reports a month is the chief end-product
of CS collection operations. Watch Officers serve on a
work of the Board of Directors, which are not a part of
he serves alone. He must make quick, independent dissemina-
tion decisions. Mr. Hicks has done well at this work. He
is alert and conscientious and has a sharp operational sense
which is extremely useful in the handling of CS intelligence
information. He has been recommended several times for pro-
mation of the Board.
4. The high quality of Mr. Hicks's performance has
continued for more than two years. There is no reason to
expect any decline in it. His enthusiasm continues, and
his tour has recently been extended for another two years.
5. Consideration has been given to recommending him
for an Honor and Merit Award, but on balance I believe that
a Quality Step Increase would be more appropriate.

SUBJECT
:
Performance on the Intelligence Watch
During the President's Trip to Europe
1. Now that the President's trip to Europe has been
concluded. I feel that a special commendation for the
Intelli- Watch (18) is in order.
2. The contribution that is being made by the officers
in the Intelligence Watch is often taken for granted. Thus
it was natural for us, when we formed our task force to
the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. for positive
intelligence disseminations around the U.S. eventy-four-
hour-a-day available it. we were not disappointed. The
systea worked smoothly and efficiently.
3. In addition to that, it became clear that the
Intelligence Watch officers were willing and able to go
beyond the simple call of duty. We came to adhere their
competence, courtesy, and cooperation with the U.S.
of the U.S. and the U.S. and would have been immeasur-
ing to have difficult, since the U.S. were working under
an unusual strain, caused by the simultaneous outbreak of
crises in different parts of the world, their performance
is that much more to be commended.
4. Please convey our appreciation to all officers who
had a part in this fine effort.

since June 1967, and serves on a rotating schedule with seven other
officers doing identical work, five of whom are currently in Grade CS-14.

both quantitatively and qualitatively has been consistently of a very

At least a year is required before a Watch Officer can perform at a high
level of proficiency. However, in the case of this officer, in a little

it over since. Although most of his integrity experience had been in para-
tention, the employer has been able to be able to be able to be able to be

even tempered and level headed. His mintakes are few and infrequent and
these are usually of the clerical variety, not in matters of judgment. I

intelligence is the portion of the iceberg which shows to the intelligence

the Watch Officers were commended by the Chief, TI Staff and the Chief,
Europe Division for their performance during the President's trip to
Western Europe. The simultaneous outbreak of crises in different parts of
the world Further added to the burdens of the Watch Office at that time.
N. Hicse made a real contribution during that period and deserves the
commendation personally in a high degree.

3. Prior to his assignment to the Intelligence Watch, Mr. Hicks
served with Mr Division and with the others Operation. In his an exten-
sive background in paramilitary operations both in the Field and at
headquarters. All of his Times Reports for the six years preceding
his assignment to the Intelligence Watch have borne the overall rating
of "strong." He has been described as "highly motivated" "incorse and
capable. He has been further complimented as "working well with others
and the other officers, and the other officers, and the other officers, and
described him as "serious, hard-vorking and dependable." His performance
in his present assignment has demonstrated these same qualities. He has
managed the transition from active operations to the life of a desk bound
intelligence officer with ease. I recommend him with enthusiasm for
promotion to 08-14.

EDWARD J: CARROLL
CHIEF, FI/INT/W
ATTACHMENT
I
heartily endorse this recommendation that Mr. Hicks be
promoted to GS-14. As his supervisor points out, Mr. Hicks,
when he came to the Intelligence Watch, was essentially a
guerrilla warfare field operational officer. Positive intelli-
gence information reporting and the handling of reports were
new to him, and called for professional skills and other
qualities radically different from those which most of his
previous experience had brought into play. Yet in a relatively
short time, Mr. Hicks has developed the skills required of a
Watch Officer, and thanks to this and to other strengths has
become one of the most valuable officers in the unit.
