It is noted that Reference F identities Jorge
MAEDO as a former anti-Castrista who was tortured and doubled by
the PHRUNEN Government; HADDO appears to be the correct spelling.
"Cuca" or "Cuchi" WARTINEZ, who has held the position
of AUSPELL National Coordinator for Civil Resistance, is a personal
friend of AUCUCA. The National Coordinator is a person an
in the Mexicas Embassy. SW Mossago 12 from ANCOG-3, dated
8 December 1962 and received 12 December, reported that QUANTUM-51
01
advised "Cuca" to hide or bo cautious because NEDINA had turned out
to bo a G-2 member. The messago said that this was learned from
AUSPELL prisoners and that, during interrogation, they wore asked
many questions about "Cuca" and AMCOG-2.
b. When the AMBITN-53 security review mentioned in Reference A
is received, additional investigation as necessary will bo made at
JNAAVE.
