1. IN RESPONSE REF A QUESTION, AVAILABILITY IS MAIN
DES-NFD
FEATURE, BUT EASE IN ADMINISTRATION AND SECURITY ARE ALSO
FACTORS INFLUENCING OUR PROPOSAL TO COMBINE PHOTO OPERATION
WITH KOVALUT TECHNICAL OPERATION. APARTMENT UNDER EARLIER
B
CONSIDERATION WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL PROBABLY SOMETIME
IN MAY, AND WE DO NOT NOW HAVE ANY SUITABLE CANDIDATES TO
TAKE POSSESSION WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. COMBINING BOTH
OPERATIONS WILL REDUCE NUMBER ASSETS INVOLVED, COSTS, AGENT
MEETING AND PROJECT ADMIN. SECURITY WILL BE ENHANCED BECAUSE
TWO ACTIVE SITES IN SUCH CLOSE PROXIMITY CKPOLAR INSTALLATION
WOULD DOUBLE COVER PROBLEMS AND DOUBLE NUMBER OF CLANDESTINE
MEETINGS TO RETRIVE PRODUCT.
2. IN SUM, BOTH APARTMENTS IN QUESTION HAVE ESSENTIALLY
SAME DESIRABILITY FEATURES FOR KDVALUT OPERATION. HOWEVER,

KDFACTOR Operational Report, 1 March 1972 through 31 July 1972
KITHUR REQUIRED: REHINDS

REFERENCE
: HMMA-41,734, 10 March 1972 (Previous Report)
INTRODUCTION
1. The KDFACTOR Project has been terminated because of develop-
ments reported in other channels. This will be the last of the opera-
tional reports forwarded to Headquarters and primarily a wrap-up of
developments to date.
OPERATIONS
2. The KDFACTOR Project supported two visual and photographic
surveillance points (KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) directed against the
MHILARSH installation. Operations from the KDLITERAL surveillance
point were suspended on 4 July 1972, the equipment removed on 7july,
and the operator, KDFACTOR-2, terminated the same date. Operations
from the KDABSINTHE surveillance point were suspended on 28 July, the
equipment removed on 29 July, and termination of KDFACTOR-5 and his
family accomplished the same date.
ADMINISTRATION
3. Oliver J. MANKUNAS continued to have responsibility for
inside administrative chores and agent handling throughout the period.
Processing of the photo product was accomplished inside the Station.
PERSONNEL
4. The project included five salaried assets. KDFACTOR-2
operated the KDLITERAL basehouse. NDFACTOR-5 operated the KDABSINTHE
basehouse with the assistance of his wife KDFACTOR-6 and his two sons
KDFACTOR-8 and -9. Both KDFACTOR-2 and -5 have served BKTRUST in
their photo specialty since 1957.

5. KDFACTOR-2 will continue to reside in the KDLITERAL building,
as part of his termination agreement, until probably sometime in
December when he will move to new quarters of his own. The KDLITERAL
building (MEXI-03, Unit 15) is part of the KDVAWLT complex of build-
ings which will be disposed of as reported in other channels. If this
occurs before December, KDFACTOR-2 will move at the time of disposal.
6. KDFACTOR-5 and his family will vacate the KDASSINTHE apart-
ment o/a 31 August. KDASSINTHE is located in a building owned by
KDABBEY who plans to dispose of his equity in the property in the
near future.
PRODUCTION
7. KDLITERAL: Before being closed down, KDLITERAL, through
KDFACTOR-2, was the source of within-the-compound photographic cover-
age of PCS and TDY MIHARSHERS. He provided an average of three rolls
of film a week and provided weekly written reports based on his
visual observation of the target area.
8. KDASSINTHE: Operated by KDFACTOR-5, KDASSINTHE produced an
average of six rolls of film a week and was our principal source for
information on visitors to the MIHARSH installation, especially
"WOCOR-type" persons and political exiles. This segment of KDFACTOR
was also our main source of information on MIHARSH license plates
and automation.
In addition, KDLITERAL and KDASSINTHE both provided detailed
"attendance sheets" on all MIHARSH personnel. With the loss of this
combined coverage, it will be difficult to identify personnel assigned
to the MIHARSH installation or to monitor their daily movements in
and out of the compound. The two surveillance points also provided
periodic photo studies of the MIHARSH installation itself with empha-
sis on coverage of the construction changes and modification or addi-
tions made to the communications antenna system.
SECURITY
10. We were gratified to receive the very favorable Headquarters
KDFACTOR security review which was forwarded as HMM-19,061, 28 June
1972. There is no need for further comment.
PROBLEMS
11. Only the developments reported in other channels.
FINANCES
12. KDFACTOR Project termination costs have been charged to
FY 1972 with the exception of rent payments and utility costs which
are being charged to FY 1973. The breakdown of agent termination
costs is as follows:
KDFACTOR-2
$102,000
KDFACTOR-5
29,575
KDFACTOR-6
35,380
KDFACTOR-8

film and provided weekly written reports based on his daily visual
observation of the target area.
5. KDABSINTHE: Cerated by KDFACTOR-5, KDABSINTHE produced
100 rolls of film and continued to be the principal source for infor-
mation on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, with special atten-
tion given to visits of "WOCORK-type" persons and political exiles.
This segment of KDFACTOS also continued to be the main source of
information on MHHARSH license plates and automobiles.
6. KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE both continue to provide detailed
"attendance sheets" on all MHHARSH personnel. Without this combined
study, the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE has been used to evaluate the
the MHHARSH installation of to monitor their daily movements and
activities. In addition, the two surveillance points provide periodic
photo studies of the MHHARSH installation itself with emphasis on
coverage of any constructionchanges and any modification or additions
made to the communications antenna system. Both sites are also
available to service special support requests as required. During
the period, KDLITERAL performed a number of special photo surveys and
a three-week frequency sweep requested by NOMES.
SECURITY REPORT
6. KDABSINTHE: We were no known problems of security relating to the
project. In response to Reference B. request, we have reviewed all
phases of the operation and believe that project security is sound.
The project assets have all been with us for many years and have
established themselves as respectable long-time residents of the
area. All five assets, four in one year, were not available to the
project. The project assets were all been GSSWIRLED. The assets
derive a substantial portion of their livelihood from their ENTRUST
employment and would thus lose a great deal if security factors ever
necessitated a termination of their work for us. As an additional
safeguard, the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented
from each other, and there has never been any indication that either
segmentation or the use of the equipment.
8. The only termination of a project asset in recent years was
KDFACTOR-1, who formerly processed the photo product from both
surveillance points. KDFACTOR-1 was terminated amicably in March
1971. We still maintain periodic contact with him; and his brother,
KDADEAGE-14, continues to be one of the most important
opinions of the project. The physician with a wide circle of
friends, and on a number of recent occasions he has been very helpful
when we have taxed his expertise in his field or requested background
information on people in the medical profession. Although KDFACTOR-1
processed the photo product, he was not knowledgeable of the exact
surveillance point locations. Delivery and pickup of the finished
producing equipment was not available.
9. Contact is maintained with only two of the five assets.
KDFACTOR-2 and -5, both of whom are responsible for the operation of
their respective basehouses. Both KDFACTOR-2 and -5 are met weekly
to obtain the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE product for timely processing
and analysis by the Station. Meetings with KDFACTOR-2 and
-5, both of whom are responsible for the operation of the products.
KDFACTOR-5 consist of car meetings early in the morning along his
route of travel to his overt job. These meetings last only long
enough to pick up the product, provide new supplies, and pay salaries,
rents, utility bills, etc. Emergency contact plans and
the Station and have been forwarded to headquarters for both KDFACTOR-
2 and -5. KDFACTOR-6, -8, and -9 are members of KDFACTOR-5's inme-
nance family and could be contacted through him asking his emergency
plan.
10. We have taken action recently to guard against the contin-
gency that one of the present sites might be blown, and alternate

OPERATIONS
1. The NDFACTOR Project continued throughout the past six
months to support two visual and photographic surveillance points
(KUDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) directed against the MIRHARSH installation.
ADMINISTRATION
1. Noard T. BAGUAS handled the administration of the project
until early April 1971 when project responsibility reverted from the
Ops Support Section back to the NDETOP Section. At that time Timothy
H. ARCHIBOLD assumed the inside administrative chores, and agent
meetings were turned over to the outside case officer Bruce H.
FERNAID who had previously handled the assets. When ARCHBOLD de-
parted PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J. MANKUNAS assumed his responsi-
bilities. MANUNAS also took over agent meetings from FENALD left
on home leave on 25 June and will continue to handle the project
assortment.
3. Processing of the photo product is now accomplished inside
the Station by Phemia B, CHAUVEAU, KDFACTOR-1, who formerly did all
the processing in an outside safohouse/darkroom, was terminated
amicably in early March 1971, and at that time the responsibility
is to be given to the other one the new arrangement has proven to be
more than satisfactory, Agent has have now been cut to a
minimum, and the processing of the product and delivery to the con-
sumer has been speeded up considerably.
PERSONNEL
4. The project includes five salaried assets. KDFACTOR-2
operates the KDITRIAL base house and has been employed in this
capacity since 1957. KDFACTOR-5 operates the KDABSINTHE base house

with the assistance of his wife, KDFACTOR-6, and his two sons,
KDFACTOR-8 and -9. KDFACTOR-5 has also served JRLANCE in this
capacity since 1957.
PRODUCTION
5, KDLITRERAL During this reporting period, KDLITRERAL,
through KDFACTOR-2, continued to be the source of within-the-compound
photographic coverage of PCS and TDY MHARSHers. He produced 76
thousand patients. He had been well written reports based on his daily
visual observation of the target area.
6. KDABS INTHS: Operated by KDFACTOR-5, KDABS INTHB produced
167 rolls of film and continued to be the principal source for infor-
mation on visitors to the MHARSH installation, with special atten-
tion given to visits of "WOCORK-type" persons and political exiles.
This segment of KDFACTOR also continued to be the main source of
information on MHARSH license plates and automobiles.
7. KDLITRERAL and KDABSINTHE both continue to provide detailed
"attendance sheets" on all MHARSH personnel. Without this combined
coverage, it would be difficult to identify personnel assigned to
the MHARSH installation or to monitor their daily movements and
activities.
SECURITY
8. There were no known problems of security relating to the
project. The termination of KDFACTOR-1 should pose no security
problem: Contact was broken ancitably, and it is not a possible
basis for the use of the security. The result of again if his services
are needed. Of the remaining assets, all five have been SGSWIRLED
in the past. They derive a substantial portion of their livelihood
from their JKLANCE employment and would thus lose a great deal if
security factors ever necessitated a termination of their work for
us. As an additional safeguard, the KDLITRERAL and KDABSINTHE opera-
tions are compartmented from each other, and there has never been
an extension that either segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's
existence.
9. Contact is mainly in the case of the security.
KDFACTOR-2 and -5, KDFACTOR-2 is shown are responsible for the operation
of the security of the Base houses. Both KDFACTOR-2 and -5 are not
weekly to obtain the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE product for timely
processing and analysis by the Station. Meetings with KDFACTOR-2
are car pickups at periodically changed locations in the suburbs.
Meetings with KDFACTOR-5 consist of car meetings early in the
morning along his route of the building. The work of the meetings
will be used to be held for the K&P, the K&P, the product, provide new supplies,
and pay salaries, rents, utility bills, etc. Emergency Contact
Plans are on file at the Station and have been forwarded to Head-
quarters on both KDFACTOR-2 and -5. KDFACTOR-6, -8, and -9 are
members of KDFACTOR-5's immediate family and could be contacted
through him using his emergency plan.
PROBLEMS
10. There were no known problems connected with the project
during the reporting period.
FINANCES
11. The termination of KDFACTOR-1 and the subsequent elimina-
tion of outside photo processing costs accounts for the drop in
anticipated project expenses shown below for FY 1972 and FY 1973.

OPERATIONS
1. The LIEMPTY Project continued throughout the period
to support two visual and photographic surveillance points
directed against the MITHARSH installation and to support the
related photo processing of the product.
a. LICALLA is the designation of that portion of
the Project that covers surveillance of the rear and
grarden area of the MITHARSH installation. It operates
from one of the units (MEXI-03) of the LIMESA, Station-
frowed on the portites, and it includes only one agent:
LIEMPTY-90.
b. LILYRIC is the designation of that portion of
the Project covering surveillance of the front entrance
of the MITHARSH installation. It includes LIEMPTY-13
and LIEMPTY-14, which is the main topography by
his wife, LIEMPTY-14, who is the main photographer,
observer and log-keeper, and their two sons, LIEMPTY-28
and -27 who assist in photography, maintenance of arrival
and departure logs on target personalities, and preparation

of the typewritten reports submitted to the Station.
The basohouse (MEXI-152) is located near the front of
the NHIRASHI installation and it is owned by LIMOUSINE.
(Contrary to Reference B and B 1000, MUSINE
is the actual, not "ostensible", owner of this
property. Please see
8 January 1968, for
full details of the various property transfers,
destruction and re-construction of buildings and
passage of operations connected with the Project,
and press.
c. Photo processing is accomplished by LIMEMPTY-4
except in special cases when prints are required
quickly and are processed within the Station. LIMEMPTY-4
has a darkroom located in the rear of his medical
office and he handles the work after normal office
and the room.
2. Outside office
Outside office for Bruce H. FERNALD handles the three
key agents of the Project (LIMEMPTY-9, -13, and -4). He meets
with each once a week for passing requirements, paying agent
and sub-agent salaries, rents and other expenses, providing
supplies; and rotricving the product. Inside cause officer
Timothy M. ARCHBOLD handles the internal administration of the
Project and is the Station contact with FERNALD.
MEETING ARRANGEMENTS
3. LIMEMPTY-13: He is met by FERNALD in the early hours
of Tuesday mornings at about 0730 in Polanco, an area far from
the basohouse. LIMEMPTY-13 parks his car and walks through a
central park on Calle Horacio where he is intercepted within
the area and is located in the LAND, driving his car. During a
drive together, instructions of the proposed plan are taken them
and, once a month, LIMEMPTY-13 is paid his salary and the
salaries for LIMEMPTY-14, -26 and -27. After drop-off LIMEMPTY-13
returns to his car and proceeds to his full-time job, thus
avoiding any direct route back to the basohuse operation.
4. LIMEMPTY-15: After completing his surveillance workday
from 0800 LIMEMPTY-16, to complete his willten reports and
drives to meet FERNALD at the end of the meeting. The
The location of car meetings varies but remins within a quiet,
fairly secluded section. After leaving FERNALD, LIMEMPTY-9
proceeds to his cover job at a brother's automobile dealership
for the remainder of his day, again avoiding any direct route
from the car.
5. LIMEMPTY-4: After receiving the unprocessed take from
LIMEMPTY-9 and -13, FERNALD prepares instructions, as suggested
by log entries that accompany the take, and goes to LIMEMPTY- 4's
medical office waiting room in the late afternoon. For these
meetings, FERNALD appears to be a pharmaceutical salesman or
a patient and gets to see LIMEMPTY-4 only after all other visitors
and the car. The patient is not a customer. The patient is
both LICALLA and LILYRIC for processing and retrieves the
processed take that he had left the week before. While this
arrangement means that some of the product (those photos taken
soon after meeting with LIMEMPTY-9 and -13) are almost two weeks
and the car. When the Station is open, we have not found this to be
unacceptable. When the Station operates the essence in special
circumstances, the Station WOACE technician can handle the
SECURITY
6. With the exception of the potential problems connected
with the Raymond H. GERENDE/LIEMPTY-19 divorce, of which
Headquarters is aware, there are no known problems of security
connected with this Project.

T. During the period of this report, LIENITY-4 processed
approximately 142 rolls of 36-exposure film. Roughly one-third
comes from LICALLA and the remainder from LILYRIC which
commands the better view and move trafficked approach. In
addition to this routine workload, LIENITY-4 was called upon
frequently for additional prints and enlargement of special
targets or interest.
8. LIENITY-9 (LICALLA), in addition to his architecture-taking
(perched for seven hours daily atop a ladder or movement to see
above the heightened garden wall), regularly provides a detailed
analysis of the potential of the new HARDS and
activities. The photos are an indispensible tool in the day-
t6-day REDTOP operations program, providing photo identifications
of PCS and TDY MHHARSHIORS and assisting to determine probable
changes in the development of the new HARDS and the
compound. The detailed "attendance sheet" helps in keeping
track of MHHARSHIERS present, their patterns and changes in
pattern of activities. This information is often the principal
tool in PREAMPART activities, assisting in identifying the
probable MHHARSH contacts of double agents despatched to the
MHHARSH installation.
9. Following are some sample requirements which were levied
on LIENITY-9 during the reporting period:
a. weekly reports of work being done at the installation
by YERSHOV and PANOV (DIRECTOR 025386), TDY construction
workers since May 1970.
b. special reports on the activities of AEMERGER who
was under the microscope prior to home.eve departure
in July 1970.
c. reports on the activities and associations of
Mikhail Vasilyevich UNNOV (201-819913), TDY AMTORG
representative from New York who is of JKLANCE and
LNERGO interest.
d. watch for the arrival of Viktor Nikitovich KRESOV,
AEKICK officer of Executive Action Department.
e. confirm arrival and provide details of activities
and associations of Subject of 201-866272 (Mobile ANGUS),
LNERGO/LNREAD double agent.
f. special report on ASTURNKEY throughout the period.
(LIEMPTY-9 is given a target for concentrated coverage
and reporting over a two or three montl period at a time.)
10. LILYRIC was provided with the same requirements as
LICALLA (paragraph 9 a-e, above), LILYRIC is the main source
of license plate and automobile information both on MHHARSIERS
and on visitors to the installation, and has a standing
requirement to report by phone the arrivals of all obviously
available items. One such individual, who now visits regularly,
has been tentatively identified as the language instructive
the MHHARSHIORS. 3 on and a potential field which we will
investigate.
CHANGES
11. Effective 1 July 1970, all of the agents of the Project
received salary increases (HMA-39548, 10 October 1970) for a
net increase of $2,184.00 U/S/D per year.

operations are essential for an understanding of the functioning

of the Project, the Station proposes to report semi-annually
hereafter. on 31 October and 30 April, including sufficient
financial and other data in April to assist in the project
of the Project. The Project is a standard REDTOP and other
Station operations has been well documented over a long period
of time. There have been no recent additions or changes in
either personnel or basehouse properties and none is contemplated.
Any significant events which might affect the Project's operation,
such as the GERNDE divorce, will, of course, be reported
separately.
13. The basic operation of the Project remains the same with
only spot requirements in support of specific objectives
changing from time to time.

HWA-39188
The logs showed that ATTUNNEY might have made the first meeting,
but would certainly have been late for it. For the alleged second
meeting, however, the log showed that ATTUNNEY was in the MIHARSH
Embassy for the entire period of the meeting (subject of MEXICO CITY
3389 later amended his story to say that ATTUNNEY has been
introduced in the 1970s. The 1970s, the 1971s, the 1972s to spot the
subject of MEXICO CITY 3542, 25 June 1970, making visits to the
MIHARSH Embassy, and reported these visits by phone even before
the Station had learned, from LIEVOY, of this person's telephone
contact, and the 1970s, the 1971s, and 1972s. The 1973s, the
also routinely reported to local LIEVOY, along with a request for
license plate resolution if a WOLADY license plate is spotted.
Late in June, LILYRIC was alerted to report the possible visit of
a person who had made a phone call to 201-087316, offering the
latter some "interesting information." LILYRIC spotted and
photographed a person who had selected with the caller, and
attempted to send a new name.
6. LIEVOY-4 continues to handle all photo developing and
printing (except when certain prints are needed quickly), and in
spite of his leg injury, from which he is now recovered, he did
not miss any deadlines. The fact that GRENDE has been terminated
to the party. The 1970s, the 1971s, and 1972s, the 1973s, the
though he is married to one of GRENDE's sisters. FENALD has
established good rapport with him, and he has stated that GRENDE's
problems are not his and will have no effect on his association.
7. The above recital of LILYRIC and LICALLA: activities would
seem to indicate a heavy CI emphasis. Actually, this is not the
case. While CI is an important by-product, net only for ourselves
to the same time, the 1970s, the 1971s, and 1972s, the 1973s,
the day-in day-out bread and butter photo and fixed surveillance
information is of great importance to our positive operations. The
dntn base which has been built un and maintained by LIEVOY
facilities, along with the services of LIEVOY, LIFRAI. and
LIEVOYACH, give the Station an INFINASIVE sumnve* ammaras which
is vital to our program.
8. With respect to the approved project renewal forwarded
with Reference B, we have the following comments:
a. Through an oversight, we neglected to report in
Reference A that LILYRIC base house rent was raised as of
I January 1970 to an annual rate of $3,360.00 (USD).
b, LICALLA base house rent was raised, effective 1
July 1970, to an annual rate of $1,378.00 (USD). (Reference
B shows that this figure has already been requested for
1971.1)
c. As indicated in Reference A, salary increases for
all remaining LIEVOY personnel will probably be recommended
in the near future.
b. GRENDE dark room rent (MEXI 137) is now being
paid to LIEVOY-4 pending the completion of GRENDE's new
house the lab work was being done temporarily in LIEVOY-4's
office. With the suspension, and now the termination of
GRENDE, it became necessary to maintain the new
GRENDE's new design and creation felt it only fair to pay LIEVOY-4
this fee ($80.00 USD per month), not only for the use of his
space but also for increased water and electric bills.
(particularly the latter) resulting for high to develop,
print, and dry, and water, and water, and third through December
1969, the June 1970 LIEVOY-4 was paid retroactively for
the period 1 January to 30 June 1970. It is planned to continue
the monthly payments, so this item should bc restored in the
next project renewal request.

MIIHARSIERS undoubtedly assume we have a LILYRIC-like facility, and
act accordingly, are another vital element of the REDTOP program.
LEMPTY-4
9. LIEMPTY-4 has continued to develop and to print all of
the LICALLA and LILYRIC photographs. He has been met regularly by
Bruce H. FERNALD (taking over for GERIRED) since 26 November 1969.
The first few meetings at that time (late November and early
December) were arranged by the 1969 conference. He was a member and
of the 1969 conference. DIPTY-4's reports on GERIRED's family problems
and related security arrangements. Since mid-December, LIEMPTY-4
resumed a regular schedule (usually weekly) of meetings at
pre-arranged sites and times. LIEMPTY-4 has been used to special
extension in the meeting of the 1969 conference. The 1969 conference
was
for "Victor" (FERNALD) FERNALD can change meeting
plans by directly calling LIEMPTY-4. The only personal problem
directly involving LIEMPTY-4 was surgery on his knee which required
his wearing a full cast of the hip. He was a member of his
this post-arranged site. He has been unable to drive, FERNALD has
been
not
to
contacting LIEMPTY-4, for the exchange of LICALLA/LILYRIC films
and prints, at LIEMPTY-4's office, under a suitable pretext and with
appropriate security precautions. LIEMPTY-4's services are
invaluable since the Station could not, on a continuing basis,
process the LIEMPTY material in its own photo lab.
SECURITY
10. Other than the security problems inherent in GERIRED's
personal problems, there have been no security problems during the
reporting period.
FUTURE PLANS
11. As for GERENDE, the Station has reached the conclusion
that he must be terminated. This is not an easy decision to make,
nor will it be easy to confront GERENDE with this decision. He
has, after all, devoted 15 years of his life. He has been
awarded a member of his wife and his father. Station has been able
to get along without his services. Furthermore, the constant
security risk posed by his wife is, frankly, an unacceptable risk.
To try to molify her by promising 'her a portion of his salary is
probably unworkable in realistic terms. He is a member of his
service. He is a member of his wife. The Station, therefore,
intends to terminate GERENDE prior to the end of FY 1970. GERENDE's
contract calls for a termination bonus of one month's salary per
full year. This would come to $8,750 (Univeralty) and $10,000
per month. The amount of the amount of activity of the operation by
ensuring that the termination is amicable, it will probably be
necessary, as stated in paragraph 6, to give GERENDE about $10,000
(USD). Furthermore, it will be necessary to inform LIEMPTY-19 of
the termination, and the termination of the termination of the termination
of the termination, he is to be given some money herself. The
Station does not believe that it would be equitable or sound from
a security point of view to use the money which GERENDE himself has
earned for this purpose. The terms of the termination of the main
term of the termination, believes that the sum of $2,500 (USD)
would be a reasonable amount. Total obligations for FY 1970 in
the LIEMPTY Project are currently estimated at slightly less than
$33,000 (USD). The Project is based on the terms of the terms of
$38,870 (USD) leaving unobligated approximately $6,000 (USD). It
was a member of his wife and his father. LIEMPTY Project be amended for
FY 1970 to provide an additional $8,000 (USD) to be used in the
GERENDE termination. Funds will be available at the Station.

LICALLA, LILLYRIC, and LIMABTY-4 are concerned. In changes in

Case. Officer and Chief of Station
FROM
: GERENDE
SUBJECT: GERENDE Background and Status Report
of Present Marital Conflict
1. While this is not intended to be a full exposition of my
personal and private life over recent years, I would like to make
known some of the factors that have, from my point of view, led
up to the problem.
1. The realize that the interests of the organization and the
interest of the individuals who may have opportunity to come in
contact with my case dictate as little personal involvement as
possible in the lives of agents. Indeed, the requirements of
security, compartmentation and efficiency prescribe the nodule
and the use of a new product of a new product. The new product
personal not only in the sense of earning a living but also in
manner of living. Ideally, the less said about an agent's private
life, the better, but, as the years go by, changes may occur which
go unreported or uninticed and which may bring about unexpected
information about the product. The new product is a new product. The
Station, as I have, for lifteen years with little or no personnel
handling problems, no security flaps, no obvious problems on the
job, and something comes up like the abrupt separation of my
wife (LIBERTY-10) and we with the new product. The security
is a new product that some explanation is necessary.
Should it be in order, I would like this explanation tc reach not
only my present case officer and Chief of Station but also the
former Chief and officers with whom I have had the privilege to
work over the years.
3. I would like to give thanks, in advance, for the patience
and understanding that have been shown me thus far. Whatever the
final outcome, I know that people have been bending over backward
to be helpful and patient in hopes of an early solution to the
conflict.
4. Back in September 1959, shortly after our wedding in late
1958, my wife and baby girl, were moved, by the agency, into a

the best thing to do was to invest in land and build a house big
enough for our growing family which by now had a fourth child on
the way. With three friends as partners, I entered on a land-buying
area, I had a new home of a complicated as we bought the land in
the form of company stock. The land was a new home of a land
assets were distributed, as land, to the four partners. I paid for
our share with the proceeds from the sale of a small lot I had been
paying for since 1955, LEMPTY-19 was at first reluctant to tie
the land. I had a new home of a land. I had a new home of a
deed straightened out, she threw herself wholeheartedly into the
project and the building which began in August 1967. While LEMPTY-19
purprised the construction, I worked during September and October
1967, I had a new home of a land. I had a new home of a
from Czechoslovakia which came to train in the pro-olympics. My
father-in-law deposited money in Mexico to help us with the major
part of the financing of the house. We used $286,500 pesos of its
money and about $60,000 than the new home of a land. The new
house was a new home of a land. I have in March 1968. We were very short
on furniture and shortly after moving, in bought three bedroom sets,
an autonatic washer and even a piano. Naturally, cash was scarce,
dirt was plentiful. The yard was a pile of rubble, the carpentry
and the house. The store no closest to the house was unpainted.
Thevefter, we did things on the house as the money come in
continued with carpentry, finished the store. The new home of a
built a fence and front gate.
7. Six months after moving, the farmer knew for the Olympics and
I worked, unofficially this time, with a new home of a land. The
Austrick, a new home of a land for the month with the Dutch and
Belgian radio and TV group. LEMPTY-19 was, once again, caught up
in the atmosphere of being among Europeans and doing something
exciting and out of the routine of home and children. She fell in
love with the Australians as well, and for several months all she
had to be a new home of a land. We were to Australia to assist
thought but decided that she had a new home of a land to invest nor the
youth and technical training to make it as pioneers "down under"
and, on the other hand, family, friends, a house, and you seniority
here in Mexico.
8. Toward the end of 1968, LEMPTY-19 decided it was time for
me to be a new home of the master bedroom as she could no longer face
that aspect of our married life. For several months we tried this
but it did not work out for ne. One night in March 1968 after we
returned home from a party, she asked me to help her.ndress and
when she, once again, revised to have anything to do with me, I
had a new home of a land. The new home of a land was a new home

as possible. Her father provided the plane fare and she left in
April for the United States to visit her brother and sister and
Holland, for what she said would be a five week trip. She stayed
tray ten weeks. The four children remained with me, the maid, and

IUSTY-19 bore an air of respiration water than of enthusiasmand,
again, as on her previous return from Europe, was physically down
and mentally unhappy. When asked about her thoughts on Australia
she said that it she had wanted to live in Australia, she should
have married an Australian. The separation had not improved our
intimate relationship.
9. In August I was a very good job. I am not sure that I had
childhood to Astro-World in "question and visit my mother's family in
South Carolina, and I was suggested postspring making monthly payments
on her "father's loan until December when the Christmas Bonus would
cover the back debt, in order to make the trip, she was adamant.
saying that if I did not have the cash for going, I should not take
leave. I borrowed from my life insurance policy and left with the
saying that the child would have to pay for a little time. I would
joined us three weeks later. After spending the month in South
Carolina, we returned to Mexico to find that LEMPTY-19 had very
much enjoyed her solitude. We had already talked about divorce before
the year. I would like to have to pay for a little time. I would
consider parting with the children and she said she would consider
leaving them to me if I would settle the debt to her father as well
as give her a substantial share of what she considered was her part
of the child. I would like to have to pay for a little time. I would
since the buying of the land. LEMPTY-19 said I could mortgage or
sell the house but that the homey was what she was mainly interested
ia. I told her that the sale of the house was not financially
reduced. I would like to have to pay for a little time. I would
likely to appreciate sharply over the next three or four years
considering the housing developments going on in the area. Added
to this was the seintential attachment to the house and area. A
mortgage, on the other hand, for the amount of her father's loan
plus what she was asking, was something I could not afford considering
the money for the child. I would like to have to pay for a little
time.
10. At the same time, during September 1969, that we were going
through the above-mentioned discussions, LEMPTY-19 was taking a
course at Japan Airlines to become a tour guide and group leader
for trips to the Orient as early as November 1969 and, certainly,
to Expo '70 in Osaka during the spring and summer at 1970. The
month of the day, the day, and the day, was the day, and the day, and
out of the marriage and wanted to be free to travel it was all
right by me but that the children would stay with me and I would
continue to repay he father at the agreed rate ($2500 per month
in the day, and the day, and the day, and the day, and the day, and
friend, Dutch lawyer Guillermo Floris Margdant who, in turn, steered
hor to a young woman lawyer, Dra. Berta Martinez, who must have
advised LEMPTY-19 that under the local legal system the only way
to try for a sizable cash settlement and considerable support was to
hang on to the children because LEMPTY-19 made a radical "about-face"
in her attitude concerning them and she now said that she could not

"abandon" the children. I refused to visit her lawyer with her
saying I was not interested in getting divorced, whereas she said
that her mind was made up and that we would have to split up.
11. Things came to a head on the night of 12 November when I
got home around 9 PM and she suggested we have a drink and talk
things over. I mixed come martinis and she began laying down the
tobacco shop. I said that the problem is not a good thing. I would
move out of the house, mortgage to pay back her father's money
grant her custody of the children and support of 2,000 pesos per
month per child ($8,000). I said I would not get divorced under
those courts, including the discussed and argued in the kitchen for about
1000 pounds, calling a back for the day. I would not have to pay
upstairs' and when I tried to make up to her she tried to rouse the
children, unsuccessfully, and then tried to leave the house which
I would not let her do. She got hysterical, ploned a neighbor,
and I would not have to pay a good thing. I would not have to
next door neighbors, Walter Hurley and his wife, and asked to go to
their house. A few minutes later, Uta and her husband Guillermo
came and LEMPTY-19 went with them to their home two blocks away.
but a half-hour later I walked up to Uta's to ask LEMPTY-19
to come home but was told that she was busy phoning her lawyer
and we were.
12. The following morning I took the children to school as
usual and my sister Marcia (LlEMPTY-4's wife) picked them up and
took them to her house where I joined them for lunch. LEMPTY-19
came by in the late afternoon while my sister was rut, picked up
the children saying she was taking them home, failed to do so, then
disappeared and was not to be found.
13. It was the subsequent action taken by LEMPTY-19 in
dropping her lawyers and taking on the services of Bernabe Jurado,
the most notorious penal attorney in Mexico, that led to the
potential security hazards that ensued.

9 March 1970
TO
:
Case Officer
FROM
: GRENDE
SUBJECT: GRENDE Status Report
The present situation of the marital conflict between GRENDE and
his wife (LIBMPTY-19) is as follows:
1. GRENDE is living at his mother's apartment at 99 Carlos
B. Z. GRENDE is living at 85. He has rented a three-bedroom
apartment at TorneL 2 corner with Pedro Antonio de los Santos where
he has stored the household effects and furniture removed from his
former address at Ladera 39, follows:
2. The house at Ladera 39 is rented to an executive of
Chrysler Corporation International, Dr. Leon MARKIEWICZ, his wife,
and fifteen-year old daughter, all of Argentine nationality. The
monthly rent is 6,700 pesos M/N and the contract is for two years,
beginning 1 February 1970.
3. LIMENTy-19 and the four children are apparently still
living at the residence of the Netherlands' Ambassador, Barn
Schelberg, and the 1960, Jardines del Pedregal. It seems
fairly certain they are at that address from things that the two
older children, Adriana and Chris, have said to GRENDE on the last
two occasions he has seen them. They have been there since
5 December 1969. LIMENTy-19 has denied that she has a fixed address
and says that she is staying with "friends."
4. LIMENTy-19 is continuing to use the services of Bernabe
Juardo as her lavy: and, through him, is pressing for even more
advantage of the family by overcome than she had asked in November.
Please see the attached copy and translation of the latest proposal
made by Juardo on 4 March 1970.
5. The charges and accusations made by LIMENTy-19 against
GERNDE are still not completely resolved and are as follows:
a. Insults, threats and attempted homicide -- this charge
rests at the 5° Juzzgado Penal, 2° Corte Penal located at
30-4-74/3

Lecumberr. The judge is CRUZ Mellado. These charges have
1969 being pressed since they were originally made on 13 November
1969. The judge is CRUZ Mellado. The judge is CRUZ Mellado
case come to trial, must be made by three judges of the 24 Corte
Penal composed of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Juzgados Penales. The
judge of the 6° Juzgado is Lic. QUIRAZCO, an alumnus of
GERRENDE's lawyer, Jorge Mario MAGALLON. Together they have,
the 10th day of the 19th day of the 24 CRUZ Mellado who
agreed not to issue an arrest warrant and the 19th day of the
called for a hearing on 16 March (subsequently postponned) at
10:00. MAGALLON has given GERRENDE assurances that the charges
are likely to be dismissed.
b. Fraud -- this charge was made by LIEMPITY-19 and her
lawyer on 11 December 1969. The day after GERRENDE left the
liver in the case of the having spent a week there for
disobeying a court order. (The court order had consisted of
an unfounded request to have GERENDE expelled from his house
and to have LIEMPITY-19 reinstated there with her father, as
well as the case of the 19th day of the 19th day of the 19th
admissbn under those terms, hence disobeying the Villa Obregon
judge's order, so the judge's secretary arbitrarily ordered,
on the spot, a 10-day detention. Subsequently, the judge,
the judge has been given a 10-day detention. The case seven
days and dismiss himself from the case and divorce proceedings
as incompetent. The judge has had to face charges of
collusion from and with the lawyers of both parties, i.e.
the 19th day of the 19th day of the 19th day of the 19th
of the Procuraduria del Distrito Federal. The Public Ministry
Agent in charge of that table is Jorge GUTIERREZ Cruz.
LIEMPITY-19 claims that the money lent to her and GRENDE for
the 19th day of the 19th day of the 19th day of the 19th day
of the house and that GRENDE, knowing they were married under
the separate property marriage clause had wrongfully placed
the property in his name only, thereby committing fraud.
At a time, the attorney was also a former before Christians 1965
at a complicated transaction involving the 19th day of the 19th day of
the 19th day of the 19th day of the 19th day of the purpose.
Robert Bancroft WHITKHOUSE, John (Dick) RENNA, and James
Walter HURLEY, and each of the partners placed the property
in their respective names with the completed office of the hair
and hair hair. The attorney was also a president after nineteen
months the deeds were issued. LIEMPTY-19 supervised and prooded
the notary who made the transaction and she was perfectly aware
that the property was in GRENDE's name. In August 1967 when
he was not a party. He was not a party. He was not a party. He
was used which he had deposited in Mexico. He was the purpose,
Since January 1969, according to the terms of the
agreement, GRENDE has been paying it off and has receipts from
LIENTTY-19 to show for it.
GERENDE has presented both the land deed ("escritura")
pre-dating the construction of the house and the receipts

showing up to date payment of the loan at the "Mesa 31a. "
No further action has been taken by LEMPY Y-19 or hor lawyer
on this matter but the. charge has not finally been settled and
is still pending. The charge is, of course, unfounded and is
awaiting the proper "lubrication" in order to be filed away.
c. Neglect -- this charge was made by LEMPTY-19 in
Decece, and that the 7' Jupgado Mixto de Paz claiming that
GERENDE had been a very good practice. The other fate
and that they were utterly destitute. GERENDE was not
notified of this charge and on 9 February after attending a
hearing at the Villa Obregon juzgado (see below), once out on
the 19th day of the 19th day of the 19th day of the 19th day of
him to the Procuraduria and from there to Lecumberri. This
process involved being finger-printed and mugged. The
following day GERENDE was out on a 2,000 pesos bond and three
days later, 13 February, the justice of the peace (a woman)
and the 19th day of the 19th day of the 19th day of the 19th day and
Magallon went back on 5 March to pick up the bond money and
see if Jurado had appealed but be able to pay a 19th day of
that matter is closed.
6. On 14 November 1969, one day after LEMPTY-01 disappared
from home taking the children with her or her youth charges
against the 19th day of the 19th day of the 19th day of which
The hearing of 9 February after which GERENDE was detained, was
called by Villa Obregon judge Bonfilio SEGURA. GERENDE reiterated
the charge, LEMPTY-19 denied it, the judge ruled against her,
ordered her to prison but since the injuries were minor, it does
not require privation of liberty and she must only go and sign-in
once.
7. LEMPTY-19 is at present teaching school at the Edron
Academy on Caleri Street in San Angei Inn. The two older children
are going to school there. During the latter part of November, all
December and half of January, the children did not attend any
school. The child had been asked to ask for the 19th day of the 13:30
to try to speak to LEMPTY-19 and see the children. LEMPTY-19
has objected to this and the meetings in wo been short and fruitless
except for GERENDE learning that they are still staying at the Dutch
Ambassador's, GERENDE's last visit there was on 3 March (Tuesday).
8. After the Villa Obregon judge dismissed himself from the
divorce proceedings, according to standard procedure, the case
went to Coyoacan and Xochimlico respectively where the judges,
and the judges were not. The judge was asked to ask for the 19th
day of the 1st Juzgado Civil in the D.F. The judge is Olda
CORREA (woman) and has the reputation of being tough and pretty
straight. Since LEMPTY-19 has not given an address where divorce
suit papers can be served her, the suit has not yet been initiated
on GERENDE's part. LEMPTY-19, on the other hand, has not had


10
10
GERENDE served with papers though bis current address is known,
apparently because sho is still seeking a voluntary divorce along
the lines and terms which are stated in the accompanying set of
proposals. GERENDES cannot begin to accept these proposals in
their-present form as they are patently unfair and hardly a point
to beginning bargaining from.

8 March 1970
The following proposals were made to GERENDE on 4 March 1970
(Monday) by LEMPTY-19's lawyer, Bernabe Jurado, through a mutual
friend, Licenciado Carlos Heyu, to wit:
TERMS under which the problem of (LIEMPTY-19) and [Raymond H.
GERENDE] could be solved.
1. The right (patria potestad) to the minors would be kept
by both the mother and father.
2. The guardianship and custody of the four children is
entrusted to the mother. The father may visit the children once
a week between 10:00 and 19:00 hours; he may take them out once a
month and will return them to the mother's address before 19:00.
3. The father is obliged to pay the mother the sum of
10,000 pesos MN, in advance, per month beginning with the month
of November 1968, since which time he has not given the mother or
children any money at all.
4. This agreement will be raised to the level of a formal
public writ the day it is signed by both parties.
5. Both spouses agree to divorce voluntarily under the terms
of this agreement.
6. Upon termination of the divorce procedure, by mutual
consent, both parties will desist from the civil and penal actions
that either might have initiated against the other.
7. Both spouses are obliged to attend punctually the meetings
that the legal procedure establishes as well as grant the guarantees
demanded by the Public Ministry and acting Judge for the approval
of this agreement and granting of the divorce.
8. In order that the father may visit his children and take
them out, the mother is obliged to give notice of every change of
address.
9. With the exception of the one day a week that the father
may visit the children and the one day a month when he may take
910 1111 3 to 38,4506
20.6-74/3


- 2 -
then out, the father contracts the obligation of absolutely
abstaining from calling on the mother's address, so that she may
carry on her life freely without neglecting her children.
10. While the voluntary divorce is being processed, the
mother and children will live at
and, as
above stated, to satisfy their needs, the father will make the
first monthly payment of $10,000,
11. Neither the father nor the mother may take the children
out of Mexican territory without the authorization of the other.
12. Since GERENDE owes the parents of LIFEMPTY-19 the sum of
$286,500 plus agreed-on interest, minus whatever payments he has
been able to make, the said GERENDE is obliged to mortgage the house
at 39 Ladera, Lomas de Bezares in this city, procisely during the
course of the divorce procedure by mutual consent as ostablished
in the antecedent clauses and before the divorce is granted so that
LIFEMPTY-19's parents are reimbursed on their loan or on the out-
standing unpaid balance.
13. The expenses of making this agreement a formal writ as
well as a number of the juridore will be paid by GERENDE but these
will be fixed in an equable manner by Carlos Heyn to whose
decision both will submit.
14. In case of failure to comply with any of the clauses of
this agreement at any time or for just one time, either by GERENDE
or LIFEMPTY-19, both agree to expressly establish the following
sanctions and terms:
15. If GERENDE is the one who violates any clause just one
time, he will forfeit the house at Ladera 39 to the mother and
children, LIFEMPTY-19, Adriana Juliette, Christopher Namon, Maria
Madcleine, and Laurence Fernando, and said property will belong to
the above mentioned persons.
16. If LIFEMPTY-19 is the one who violates the terms of this
agreement for just one time, she will lose the custody of children
in favor of the father or whatever person he designates for the
guardianship and custody of the minors.
17. Since LIFEMPTY-19 has to establish an appropriate place
to live, in the company of her four children, both parties agree
that the household effects will be turned over by GERENDE, to
LIFEMPTY-19 for that purpose, as well as the automobile she has been
using throughout the marriage.

LIXMPTY Progress Report, 1 January - 31 October 1969
ATTORI ENVELOPMENT, ESTIMATES
SUMMARY
1. There has been no change in the operating procedures of
the two LIAMENTY base houses, LICALLA and LILYRIC, or in the use
made of the product. Raymond H. GERENDE continues as Project
principal agent, and renewed attempts have been made to broaden his
activities, to include additional agent handling and the following
up of ops leads. After a slow start, some progress has been made,
but GRANDDE is now involved in divorce proceedings with his wife,
This situation is steadily worsening and representatives potential
security risk to LIAMENT and other Station operations.
GERENDE
2. As Headquarters is aware, the Station has for some time
tried to get additional mileage out of GERENDE. The Station has
long recognized GERENDE's not inconsiderable talents: He is personable,
fluent in two languages (to the point where he can pass either as a
new one) and the other two languages (to the point where he can
experience in support activities, he has knowledge of the local
scene which would be hard to duplicate, and he is completely at the
Station's disposal. He has also worked for RYROCK for close to
15 years, in effect making a career of RYROCK, and the Station
has been able to work with the highest level of service. He
obligation to see that he is fairly treated and provided with benefits
which would not otherwise be due an agent with less longevity. On
the other hand, GERENDE has picked up some bad habits-he is not
punctual, his written reports leave much to be desired, and worst of
all, he lacks drive and ambition.

3. After several largely abortive attempts to get GERNDES to
follow up operational lends (and after poting, at the same time, a
fine job he did in recruiting LIRICE-13), the Station decided to
present GRENDE with what amounted to an ultimatum: Following a
six-week leave at the home of relatives in the US, he was told that
the
the
the
the
the
increase to $7,000 US per annum (which may not seem like much until
it is realized that GRENDED pays no taxes on this, and has the use
of a QP car, to boot). He was also told that he would be given a
"beneing" of the U.S. and the U.S. to be the U.S. to be the
natural access; in other cases leads which he would follow up under
cover and in alias), as well as agents to handle (in alias). It
would be up to him-to take advantage of this opportunity to perform
the

the
the
the
the
the
the
willing to work out an annuity program which would relieve his
worries about eventual retirement. If he did not put out, he could
expect to be terminated by the end of FY 1970. GRENDED expressed
that he had been the most important role in the U.S. to be the
and, in fact, he has done so. In October 1969 he took over the
handling of LIANVIL-1 from Oliver G. SCANTLING, and the Station has
started to give him leads to follow up. His performance has improved
in every way--his punctuality has improved, his written reports
are continually improving, and he has made the effort to devise
approach to the U.S. to be the U.S. to be the U.S. to be the
4. The Station was therefore highly encouraged, until 24
October, when GRENDED reported that his wife wanted a divorce. The
problem is basically one of incompatibility of personalities,
exacerbated by the fact that GERNDED's operational activities
resulted in his being home more often than a man who works an or

S E C R K T
LICALLA
S. The LICALLA base house has continued to function as in the
past. LIXEMTY-9 continues to be a conscientious recorder of events.
In addition to providing about 3,500 photos during the reporting
period, as well as comments on events and relationships which are
noted by him, he had provided special coverage as requested on
various targets of interest, such as ATEAKEOFF. During GERENDE's
absence on leave, LIXEMTY-9 was handled by SCANTLING.
LILYTRIC
7. LIXEMTY-13, -14, -26, and -27 have continued to provide
full-time coverage of the MHARSH Embassy front entrance, providing
daily logs of the coming days and goings of all officers, and about
9,000 photos and reports reporting period. The LILYRIC base house
was prepared to the visits of Americans ten different times, and provided
special coverage in connection with AEBURBLE, SCLASE-2, and one
other LNERGO walk-in case. LILYRIC personnel were also handled by
SCANTLING during GERENDE's absence.
LIXEMTY-4
8. As in the past, LIXEMTY-4 has done the developing and
printing of all LICALLA and LILYRIC photos, and most of the LIENTRAP
production. LIXEMTY-4 was handled by FERNALD during GERENDE's
absence.
COMMENTS
9. LIXEMTY coverage of the MHARSH installation continues to
be a useful tool in the Station's operational basis. The MHARSH
target. One IA in the Station spends several hours per week processing
the take, keeping mug book and a new side to date, checking the infor-
mance of the tank other reports when required (to determine
whether or not an agent or contact entered the MHARSH installation
as claimed; or whether an AEBRIP or AEKICK officer was out of the
installation at a particular time, etc.) and the other LILYCLALLA
production for insight of the relationships. Useful
and observation of demonstrations outside of the Embassy and
and observation of demonstrations outside of the Embassy and
renovations within the grounds. Furthermore, in which Station
has been attempting to develop a new plan for which considerable
information is needed, it used to make recruitments and assessments
as well as handle agents. GERENDE's personal problems are placing
his own career in jeopardy and posea potential security hazard to
LIXEMTY and other Station operations. This is a problem which will
be dealt with and resolved in the next reporting period and prior
to the next project renewal request.

6 LLEMPTY Progress Report, 1 July through 31 December 1968
ACTION REQUIRED WEEKENDS
Reference: HMMA-35080, 22 July 1968
SUMMARY
1. There have been no basic changes in the operation of the
project during the reporting period. Raymond II. GERENDE continues
as principal agent, handling the personnel of the two base houses,
LLYRIC and LICALLA, and performing other additional tasks. On
27 December 1968, consistent with our effort to get as much of the
development of the construction of the city outside officers, direct
agent-handling responsibility for GEM. and the LIMBUTY project
was turned over to Bruce II. FERNALD. Vincent P. RIZZOTT remains
as alternate and as FERNALD's inside contact.
GERENDE
2. Until the introduction of FERNALD, there was no change in
the meeting arrangements with GERENDE. Meetings were held on an
average of three times per week until October, when LEMPTY-19
(GERENDE's wife) was relieved oi the responsibility of transcribing
the Spanish-language portions of LIEVROY coverage of the BEDOX
installation. Thereafter meetings averaged twice per week, the main
business being the transfer of LEMPTY base house material and
discussion of base house business.

3. GRENDD'S agent handling responsibilities within the LIMITY
project remain as previously reported. He had also handled ERAIN-3
until the latter's termination in August 1988. He developed a good
relationship with ERAIN-3, and he showed that he is quite capable,
with proper case officer guidance, of providing useful service to
the individual of the Board of Directors, and the support type to
which he had been limited in the past. The Committee is
to expand this role, with due regard for security and for GRENDD'S
limited experience. Furthermore, the Station still has every
intention of using GRENDD selectively in cultivation and development
of the Board of Directors. He has been able to know. No such leads were
found for GRENDS during the reporting period (among other reasons,
we have no intention of giving GRENDD a lead integrity for the sake of
giving him something to do), but as soon as a single lead is
uncovered, it will be passed to GRENDED.
4. GRENDED was particularly useful during the meeting.
While he did not get a job with the Olympic Committee as he had
also decided to be able to work with the other by the European television
networks who had come to cover the games. This, plus other personal
contacts, gave GRENDE a certain amount of access to Olympic facilities.
Both GRENDED and his wife helped considerably in the distribution of
AREGGILD material, and GRENDED performed a number of miscellaneous
tasks assisting the Station in various Olympic responsibilities.
5. GRENDED has also been used in support of JMRND operations,
such as the 1988 pilot-ups and delivering material and making phone
calls to AMBASSON. He has been a Warsaw Pact Powers' invasion or
Czechoslovakia, GRENDED was asked to be a new contract
of the Soviet Embassy, and he wrote a good report which was used in
Embassy briefings. Recently, GRENDED has enrolled at the
University of the Americas to work for an M.A. in contemporary
Mexican history. The Station will explore the possibility of his
getting access to persons or information of Interest on the University
campus.
LICALLA
G. LIEMPTY-9's work (in the LICALLA base house) was inhibited
in July due to the construction of a maid's room near his working
quarters. During the reporting period, however, he took a total of
2,217 operational photos. His regular reporting and commentary
continued as in the past. LIEMPTY-9 is a steady and dependable per-
former, and his unique vantage point remains the source of the most
interesting and revealing ploches as well as often very informative
reporting.
LLYRIC
7. LIEMPTY-13, -14, -28, and -27 have been able to keep the
LLYRIC base house named on a regular basis irrom 0800 to 1500 hours
weekdays and 0800 to 1500 hours on Saturdays, with other hours cover-
able upon request. This has proven to be a lar better arrangement
than depending on LIMITED for some of this coverage. In addition to
the 9,703 operational photos taken during the reporting period and the
following the following: the 1988 pilot-ups and the 1988, considerable
help in compiling current vehicle and license plates lists the
and departures, unusual activities such as. demonstrations or protests,
unusual or lengthy absences of personnel, etc., all of which have
been made in the 1988 pilot-ups and which made it possible
for LERNGO to identify the Subject of 201-841329, and been in
claudestine contact with AERIPI of ficers. LILYRIC also reported on
a half dozen other American (or American appearing) visitors, some of
whom it was possible to identify through tracing license plates.

8. As reported in Ref, LIUMPTY-G has been terminated and the
LIMITED base house closed. All equipment has been turned in, and it
can truttully be said that due to the continuing quality performance
of LIGALLA and LLYRIC, LIMITED has not been missed at all.
PHOTO LAB
9. LINMPTY-4 continues to process all photos made by the base
houses. In addition, 101 enlargements were made during the
reporting period, and 210 prints for LINTRAP. The quality of
LIMENTY-4's work is good, and he rarely misses his routine deadlines.

4. It should not be forgotten that a person tried both to
rent and buy Limesa properties earlier in the year after ve
owned them. So far as we know, a check on this person was not
productive of suspicious data, but the question arises as to how
thorough the investigation was. Possibly the name the man gave
the name the man who is the most important and the biggest
person has never been investigated at all. Knowing that the
targets have in the past shown some interest in the Limesa build-
inge, it is not beyond the realm of reason that this man was sent
by them. The story he gave for wishing to rent the house-because
it was handy and close to a certain school--is identical with the
story used by the Station to cover rental of Liscalla almost next
door.
5. Even granting that the true ownership of Limesa has not
been discovered by the targets, they have various recourses through which
to establish the identity and activity of the occupants thereof. The
following possibilities suggest themselves:
a. Enter into litigation with Limesa owner over exact
boundaries or other pretext, demanding property be
surveyed. On court order, Limesa could be inspected
thoroughly.
b. Undermine target side of Limesa walls, leading to
possible condemnation of property by local government
or necessity various repairs, etc.
c. Sabotage of electricity (causing fire) or water or
sevage, necessitating entry into Limesa of outside per-
sons, who could be infiltrated by target agents.
d. Remming by vehicle, with similar results, police,
firemen, etc.
e. Complaint to medical authorities on filth, refuse, etc.,
leading to inspection by health authorities.
f. Various other approaches might be discussed.
6. One general recommendation can be made: sensitive material
should be used and kept in a crypt, and a good one, rather than in
the relatively insecure special room now planned as the operational
room.
7. Beyond this, every effort should be made to see to it that
the operators have good cover. The idea of clothing them in local
clothing is excellent and shows right thinking in that direction.

Summary
1. During the reporting period, the project's principal
agent, Raymond H. GRENDE, was assigned additional tasks, aimed
at broadening his usefulness to the Station. These tasks
included spotting and assessment as well as the handling of a
recruited agent, RFAIN-3, G GRENDE did well, and it is believed
that a new dimension has been opened for him, and by the same
time, the work of the U.S. Department of Commerce, was
LIERMPTY base houses continued to produce at their usual rate
and with their usual effective support to Station REDTOP oper-
ations. The LIMITED Base House and its operator, LIEMPTY-6,
were terminated on 31 May 1968. Termination was decided upon
the final approval of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and uncur-
ably decreased the reliability and use of revenues of LIEMPTY-6's
work. LIEMPTY-26 was rehired, which performed the LILYRIC Base
House to give us the same total hours of coverage as LILYRIC
and LIMITED had together in the past.

2. During the reporting period, the case of ilicer has been
meeting GERENDE an average of three times per week. Meetings
are usually pre-arranged, at various sites and times. Meetings
average 20 to 30 minutes. GERENDE turns over to the case
of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of
picked up from the base houses since the previous year
alon; with brief contact reports on his meetings with base
house representatives. Reports on other operational activities
are also turned in and discussed, and GERINDS is given instruc-
tions to the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100%
ments which may be desired by the Station. Also, LIEVONG
and transcripts are exchanged at each meeting. (The departure
of LIAUCUE-1 at the end of April 1968 left the Station without a
time of 100% of the 100% of a temporary solution, pending the return
of LIAUCUE-1 or the rest of the 100% of another BER00K transcriber,

the following LIMPTY agents: LIAUNTY-4 (photo-processor: met
twice per week); LIMPTY-6 (LIMITED: met once per week until
termination); LIMPTYS 13, 14, 26, and 27 (LILYRIC; LIMHTY-13
normally met twice per week -- in his absence LIMPTY-27 makes
meetings); and LIMPTY-9 (LICALLA; met twice per week). Ilo is
not aware of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the
all of the administrative problems with paying them; and handling
from the results, GERENDE has excellent rapport to this these
and is able to get a consistently high performance rate from
them -- particularly LICALLA and LILYRIC personnel.
4. As noted in reference, GERENDE was employed by the
Mexican MIIAVEL committee, which we found a useful side benefit.
In the LIVEL activity during the reporting period has been minimal,
but we extend the meeting, but picking up again. GERENDE has con-
ducted a few discreet in the news and investigations for us within
the MIRAVEL complex, and writes the instructed him to try to get
an assignment which will keep him a good chance for PJSTEL
delegation as possible.

requirements) were not challenging enough or occupying enough

his own, doing less work for WOFIN than at any time in his
work. He was a member of his own, doing his own, doing his

security reasons. The solution to GERINDE's problem (lack of
a promising future) and the Station's (not getting its money's
society) and the Station's (not getting its money's
could handle under suitable cover and additional tasks which he
precautions. Since most of GERENDE's support activities had
been against the FJSTEL target, particular care would have to
be taken in committing him further in this direction. It was
decided, therefore, that his principal retooling would be in
a non-JESTEAL field.

1. In line with the above reasoning, GRENDE was introduced
to Anarew R. DOSCHER on 17 February 1968. The idea was that
GRENDE would be trained to assist DOSCHER in some of his
operations against Central American targets. GRENDE's principal
duty thus far has been to take over the handling of MFFAIN-3,
and the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100%
performed quite creditably in this task. He scems interested
in the work and has learned quickly. On the other hand, an
apparently ingrained habit of procrastination has resulted in
different ways. He has been the only overcome this (and both case
officers are working hard to teach Government). He has been
proport and complete reporting) there seems to be every reason
to believe GRENDE will develop into a competent agent handler.

CONTINUATION OF
DISPIAC
SEC RE T
HIVL-35050
should be pointed out that this blanket coverage is useful
in the nature that all notivity is caught. Combined with the
initial fixed surveillance reports on all members of the FISTEAL
installation, the Station can safely say that its coverage of
FISTEAL installation ingress and egress is complete during
the last three months. The proposed systems are not
working hours (and any extra hours been on duty 57 hours per
covered) and the 1000-1800 weekdays and 0800-1500 Saturdays. Cremensurate
the
with their new schedule (and the return of LEMPTY-2c to the
active roster), the total monthly LIMIFTY-2c from 1000-1800
4,900 pesos 27,700,000,000,000 month (LIMPTYs 13,
1999-1999) 27, are of course, father, mother, and two sons).
The fixed surveillance reports are used on a daily basis, since
the Station constantly has operational interest in the
whether a particular facility is located in the same time, at a particular
area of 1000 who he went with, what time he left, etc.
In addition, LILYRIC has standing instructions to notify
GEREND (and GRENDE the Station) immediately when American-
appearing visitors come to the FUSTEAL installation. Eight such
visits were noted in the reporting period, along with a number
of other visitors who, for one reason or another, attracted the
special attention of LILYRIC.
LIMITED
LIMPTY-6 slowed down noticonbly in the reporting period.
He was ill several times, his surveillance reports were occa-
sionally inaccurate, and his photographic work was poor. With
the assurance that LILYRIC would be able to tako up the slack
(and give us better coverage for less money) the proposed
made to terminate the LIMIFTY-6 was a very visible we are thereby
considered. The LIMIFTY which we have had in the past,
it is likely that LIMPTY-6 would slowly have faded out of the
picture anyway. While he was in there, he produced 911 opera-
tional photos, as well as daily and a 1000-1800 square feet of
following the 1000-1800 report of which is being forwarded
to the LIMIFTY-6 took a trip to Europe and has now started
working full-time in the insurance business for his sou-in-law,
where he has gained a new lease on life. In other words, the
termination couldn't have been more amicable, LIMIFTY-6
the LIMIFTED apartment (he said he could not afford the Station.
paying the rent) and it is no longer available to the Station.
PIOTO LAB
12. LIMIFTY-4 has continued to process all LIMIFTY photo
work. In addition to developing and making contact prints of
all photos mentioned above, he made 778 enlargements of various
shots. The photo lab is still in his office, pending the
completion of GRENDE's house.

3. In order to overcome the nove mentioned weaknesses,
The Sustic: proposes that LEMBACY-11 be used part-time with the
survollance team. He also will continue his LIENTRAP
activities. This activity will enable the Station to make greater
use of LEMBACY-11's time and also give complete familiarity with
radio usage and surveillance tactics. LEMBACO-1, LEMBPCY-10
and LEMBAC-11 all are in agreement with this proposal.
4. LEMBACY-11 has an Operational Approval granted on 14
Superior 1958 for use on the LEMBACX team. The Station assumes
that this O1 vill allow has use on the LEMBACX team. If it this
is not the case, the Station requests that his O4 be amended to
allow 202 such usage.

1. On 25 July 1967, Raymond H. GREENDE, principal agent
1. On 25 July 1967, was introduced to his new case officer,
for the LIENTY project, was introduced to his new case officer,
Vincent P. 3122070, major reason for the change in case
of the U.S. Government of the Lirupty project into the section which
it is larger designed to support, the REDTOP section. In the
three-month period covered by this progress report, GREENDE was
noted to be a new case officer. The U.S. Government was
met by the case officer 32 times. Meeting from the introduction of
arranged, with times among the most of the former regular meeting sites
the new case officer. The most of the former regular meeting sites
were recores and new ones substituted). Meetings were occasionally
arranged via telephone, in which case a prearranged code was used.
Duo to GREENDE's MIRAVEL activity (see below) it was not always
possible to stick to a fixed meeting schedule.
2. GREENDE met with LIEMPTYS-1, 9, and 13 on a twice-a-week
basis, and LIEMPTY-6 once per week during this period. These
meetings were prearranged. As explained below, GREENDE no longer
meets LIENTY 10.

3. There were no known security incidents affecting the
LIBERTY Project or its assets during the period of this report.
LICALLA
4. LIGETTY-9 the operator of the LICALLA base house, pro-
vided 1,285 operational photographs during this period. In
addition, he provided fixed surveillance reports, sighting reports,
and special notes and comments. LIEPTTY-9 has proven himself to
be a reliable and perceptive record. The proposed approach is
the first reason, but the most skewed to provide special coverage on
For this reason, the levels of interest, or on particular days when cover-
ing the records, and the levels of interest, or on particular days, and
age is desired. The Station has found the LICALLA reports to be
consistetuly useful in determining the presence, activities, and
personal associations of target personnel. In part this is due
to the lecation of the LICALLA base house, but it is also due to
the interest, effort, and judgement of LIEMPT-9 himself.
LILYRIC
The LIVRIC has been a prolific provider of
operational photos. 4.014 having been submitted in the period
under review. While there is occasionally superluous coverage
of visiting sports and cultural delegations (and LILYRIC personnel
have been instructed to be more selective in this respect) the
blanket coverage afforded by this base house guarantees that
nothing will be missed during normal working hours. The fixed
surveillance reports are voluminous, highly accurate, and quite
valuable. On three separate occasions during the reporting
period LILYRIC altered the Station to the presence of American
visitors at the target installation.
LIMITE
The efficiency of the LIMITEO base house has suffered
a slow decline. LIEPTY-6 has been out of action for short
periods because of illness and a physical examination. The
physical, however, showed that he is in good health and we look
for an improvement in his performance in the next reporting period.
His surveillance reports are not entirely reliable due to a
tendency to assume that the normal occupant of a certain car is,
in fact, in that car. His photos, however, continue to be useful.
3.14 were provided in the period under review.
LEINTRAP
7. As noted in HEMA-32379, 13 October 1967, the LIENTRAP
photo vehicle, included by LIEUTTY-19 and LIEMTPY-11, is now in
direct contact with LIEKBACAE-1, leader of the LIEMBRACE surveil-
ing. This arrangement, which began in mid-August 1947,
has proved to be a very happy one operationally. In addition to
permitting more flexible use of LIEINTRAP for Station requirements
across the board, it has left GERNEDE more time to devote to
other duties (see below).
PHOTO LAB
8. LIEMTPY-1 has continued to process the photos taken by
the base houses, and including this period, the photo lab was
period under review. Office because of renovations going on in
moved to LIEMTY-4, LIEMTY-14, which was not a major
approach. LIEMTY-4 processes the photos after working
hours, and keeps the equipment and photos locked away during the
day. As LIEMTY-4's office is in his home, the equipment and
photos are not left unguarded over night.

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH
HMMA-3459
a possible access agent to LIRING. This eventually culminated
in an attempted recruitment of the prospect by GERNDS. Although
the attempt was unsuccessful, GRENDE exhibited considerable
results in terms and operational skill in developing the target
to a point where the recruitment attempt was possible. We plan
to use GRENDE in similar roles in the future as opportunities
arise, and for this reason we plan to document the results of
of false Mexican and American brands. We have set of false American
documentation. GRENDE is collecting exemplars and getting the
background information needod, and once the necessary data are
assembled. We have taken some needs, (WOACRA) support will be requested.
CERNDE has continued to provide support for the JUROD
operation as needed.
11. In September and-October 1967 GRENDE was employed by
the Mexican INHRAVEL committee. He was able to get assigned as
a
aide to the DIZTAG delegation. In this capacity he was able to
supplement very nicely the information and support being divided
by Jeremy S. HODAPP. This foot-in-the-door came in very handy,
and is expected to be even more valuable in 1968. If GRENDE can
get the position again. While the job was rather time-consuming
we believe the results were not.
In connection with his duties with MIRAYEL, as well as
in connection with the fact that his WOFIRM activities are nearly
100% against the FJSTELL target, GERNDE was given a very general
briefing on the Station's IEDTDF program. It is our hope that,
in having a better idea of what the Station is trying to do in
this field, GERNDE will be able to make an even greater contri-
bution to that program than he has in the past.

4. There were no known security incidents during the period covered in this
report. As a precautionary measure, the LIMELY basenousekeepers were instructed
to maintain increased vigilance in their respective areas and sullings and to be
found in the same way. The proposed plan was to be used to ensure that the
This was done because of the renewed interest in the assassination of President
Kennedy which in turn brought forth comments in the press about photographs
taken of Oswald during his visit to Mexico. On three occasions during this period,
the proposed plan was to be used to ensure that the proposed plan was to be
This was done in order to try to ascertain if any FUSTEAL personnel were taking
measures to verify the activities of LIMELY-6, LIMELY-6, LIMELY-6 reported that all
of the meetings he covered appeared to be clean of hostile surveillance,
and the proposed plan was to be used to ensure that the proposed plan was to be
LIMELY-6.
LIMELY-6 does not know the exact location of LIMITED/LIMETT-6, although he
is aware of the existence of this asset because of the radio alert system used by
the surveillance team when working the FUSTEAL target. In order to avoid
LIMELY-6.3 surveilling LIMELY-6 to the exact address, LIMELY-6-3 was instructed
to surveill ORDERED when he departed the meeting site and to report the CERNINE
after LIMELY-6-3 was convinced thing there was no hostile surveillance and after
they had departed the meeting areas.)
LICALL
5. During this period LIMELY-6, operator of the LICALLA basohouse, provided
1112 frames of operational photographs covering the petio and garden area of
FUSTEAL. All photographs provided by LIMELY-6 were accompanied by fixed-
surveillance reports, sighting reports and special notes. LIMELY-9 is a per-
ceptive individual and his special notes and comments are considered to be of
great value by the interested section in the Station. LICALLA coverage was
suspended during the period 19 through 25 March while LIMELY-6 was taking a well-
deserved vacation. The cover of the LICALLA basohouse appears to remain good,
with no undue attention devoted to it by FUSTEAL personnel.
LIMELY-6
6. This basohouse, which is staffed by LIMELY-13, -14 and -27, produced
2555 frames of operational photographs during the review period. LIMELY-13 is
employed full-time and most of the coverage is provided by LIMELY-14, and -27,
although during this period, LIMELY-14 carried the largest share of the workload.
In March the hours in which LIMELY-27, a medical student, attended school
were changed from the afternoon to the morning. This schedule change will remain
more than the hours in which the hours in which the hours in which the hours in
to remain on the job for the hours needed to provide full-tise coverage and her
homekeeping duties often interfered with her working hours. In order to alleviate
this problem, the working hours of LIMELY-6/LIMITED were increased and those of
LIMELY/CLIMITET-14 decreased. No serious loss of coverage resulted from this tem-
porary chance in working hours. The salary of LIMELY-27 was cut in half for the
period of time in which he will not be providing continual assistance to the Project.
7. LILMELY remains as the main source of information on WILADY and other
foreign visitors to FUSTEAL.
LIMETED
8. LIMELY-6, the operator of the LIMITED hasebouse, provided 684 frames of
operational photographs during the three month period. LIMELY-6 also spent a
great deal of time alerting for the LIMENSACE surveillance team during this period
because of the ASBUALITY-1 operation. LIMELY-6 was on vacation from 3 through
23 Approved in the 1990s. The previous was suspended during this period. As
a
person who adopted above, LIMELY-6 now is� the hours in order to relieve LIMELY-1-
LIMELY-6 does not know why his hours were increased.
9. On one occasion during this period LIMELY-6, while alerting the LIMENSACE
team on an FUSTEAL target, noted that a WOLADY subject had entered FUSTEAL on foot.
He alerted the team and they were able to surveill the subject and identify him
through records at the hotel where he was staying.

CONTACT AND COMMUNICATIONS
5. During the period under review, 30 meetings were held with GERENDE by
the Project Case Officer. Meeting sites and times were varied to avoid
establishing a pattern and most meetings were scheduled at the previous meeting.
Several unscheduled meetings were held during this period and were arranged by
the Case Officer telephoning GERENDE to establish the meeting time and site.
Times and sites are coded when discussed by telephone and are arranged in such
meeting times. The meeting time was recorded in the sessions to GERENDE are
made from pay booths located away from the LINFURE installation.
4. GERENDE held twice weekly, clandestine meetings with LIEMPTY-4, -6,
-9, -10, -11 and -13. These regular meetings are all prearranged and are held
at various sites and at various times of the day so that meetings correspond
with the regular habits and movements of the basehousekeepers and LIEMTNAP
operators.
5. All assets involved in the LIEMPTY project performed in a most
satisfactory manner during the period under review. LIFREND-4 has been extremely
efficient in developing and printing negatives provided by the other assets.
PRODUCTION AND ACTIVITIES
6. LICALIA. During this period LIEMPTY -9, operator of the LICALIA
basehouse, provided 1,239 frames of operational phototographs covering the patio
and garden of the FISTEIAL installation, the arson where many of the officers,
family members and visitors congregate. This coverage is especially valuable
because the officers are usually nt their leisure and often gather into
functional groupings. LIEMPTY-5 is very observant and his comments and notes
are considered of great value to the Station. All photos provided by LIEMPTY-9
are available for the same time. The LIEMPTY-13, -14, and -27 with
LIEMPTY-14 and -27 providing most of the coverage because of the full-time
outside employment of LIEMPTY-13. During this period the LILYRIC basehouse
provided 2,716 frames of operational phototographs covering the only vehicle and
pelestrian entrance into the target installation. All photographs were
recovered in the LIEMPTY-6. The full-time reports on individual members of the staff of
the parent installation. The operators are often able to provide the license
plate numbers of vehicles and visitors to the target installation, which
in many cases help to identify the VITE
8. LIMITED. The operator of the LIMITED basehouse is LIEMPTY-6. The
LIMITED beachouse also provides coverage of the only vehicle and pedestrian

LIMENTY/Security of LILYRIC, LIMITTND and LICALLA
ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
Action Required: For Your Information
1. In December 1966 Raymond H. GERENDE, Principal Agent for the LIMIFTY
Project, was asked to prepare a security reaume, including his opinions, on
the security of the LILYRIC, LIMTTED and LICALLA Bashehouses vis-a-vis Soviet
knowledge of their existence. The following paragraphs contain a slightly
edited version of GUEANDE's report, which was received on 28 December 1966.
Station comments follow GUEANDE's and are so noted.
LILYRIC
2. In its present new location LILYRIC is the newest of the photo bases
under my control. According to LIMFTY-15, there has been no indication of
interest of any sort by the Soviets in the family's move to the new apartment
nor was there in the past any show of interest or peculiar behavior on their
(Soviet's) part with regard to the old base and the possibility that they might
be under photo surveillance.
3. The cover for work carried on by this base is good since the
wife, a number of the most out of the work has no trouble in justifying
her presence at home all of the time. The son, LIMFTY-27 is a medical
student and attends his classes regularly and can justify his hours as
study hours. (He continues to be an excellent student and was exempted from
examinations at the end of this, his second year in medical school. Actually,
he studies most of the night). LIMFTY-13 requires no cover as he has a
full-time Job as reduction manager for a large concern and he usually makes
his meetings with GUEANDE on his way to or from work.

4. The set-up in the old as well as the new base is the following:
The equipment - camera, scope and tripod - is mounted in one bedroom behind
venetian blinds with one slat resolved. This room is locked to keep servants
or any chance intruder from entering. The operators do not spend all their
time behind the camera, but go to the adjoining bedroom where a table and
the
trailer is placed on the front of the window. The operator is placed on the
one other activity that does not require full concentration is carried out.
The curtains and blinds in this room are kept partially or fully open to allow
good visibility and provide a normal appearance. Most of the daily movement of
the Soviet personnel is followed from this room and when it is necessary to
take pictures of visitors, unknown periods or newly arrived Soviets, the
operators are not available.
5. GERNDES' comment. It seems to me that any careful observation by
the Soviets would have revealed the tell-tale position of the venetian blinds
in both the old and the new bases. I have no doubt that the Soviets realize
they are under photo surveillance. The move by the family from the old to the
new building must surely have been noted by the Soviets. Possibly the Soviets
think the family is working with the local authorities due to LIMCTV-13's
foreward and the other.
6. Station Comments. The Station agrees with GERNDES that careful
observation by the Soviets would have revealed the missing clit in the venetian
blinds and also the fact that those blinds are seldom open. The Station also
agrees that the Soviets require that they are under photo surveillance.
7. The series of experiments have been used to determine the size of the
they passed the front state of the Embassy and made a sign to the walk-in
indicating that they could be seen by someone watching with a telescope
from the buildings across the street. Also, as Headquarters is aware, there
are no other problems. The operators have been working with a computer
anyone entering the Soviet Embassy is photographed; however, seldom has it
been rumored that the "Americans" are doing it, which might indicate most people
believe the Mexican Government is doing any such photographing and thereby
referring GENEMIDE's statement that the Soviets possibly believe the Mexican
Government runs the possibility.
8. The system was assumption that the LILYRIC base is blown, the Station at
this point does not plan to terminate or revamp the LILYRIC installation,
Any operational change by the operators would be spotted by the Soviets and
if the Base vero closed the Soviets would start looking for a new installation.
The LILYRIC Base is performing a useful function and it is believed that it
is possible to be used to determine the system's performance and the
the Mexican Government about being monitored photographically and have not
seen it to do so and it is believed that they probably will not do so unless
there is a radical change in Soviet and/or Mexican policy. The Station has
instructed GERNDES to take every precaution during his meeting with LEMPTV-13
to assure that LEMPTV-13 does not lead the Soviets to him and thereby
separizing other operations, especially LIZALLA.
LIMETNE
1. The operator of the LIMETNE Base, LIMETNE-6. is, to my knowledge,
the oldest hand in the photo surveillance of the Soviet thrust and possibly
the cost likely to be "burned". His residence for years at the former Base
(now the site of the new LILYRIC building) and his move to the present base
could not have gone unnoticed by the Soviets. His cover is that of an
invariance saleszen, but he actually does not work at the cover and is at
a disadvantage in trying to explain his source of income. At times, in years
past, he had to afford full-time coverage from the base, which allowed his
no time to be given to the other.
9. GERNDES Comments. I do not believe that LIMETNE-6/LIMITED is a
security risk; however, his present means of working from an open door leading
to his balcony probably can be spotted by the Soviets. LIMETNE-6 is extremely
caucious about checking himself for surveillance when making meetings.

10. Station Comments. The same Station comments hadn in reference to
LILYHIC also apply to LIMIC TED. Also, the use of LIMITRE in the main
base for the LIMICRACE uprveillance team has weakened the security of this
base. In regards to the LIMICRACE and the LIMICRACE of the Soviet's are very
sufficiently. LIMICRILY-6/LIMITED and that so many Soviets has talked to him
(LICCLM-1) about LIMICRY-6 think the is convinced that the Soviets have a "fear"
and an "obsession" about LIMICRY-6. LICCLM-1 reported on 3 January 1967
that the Subject of 201-784541 and the Subject of 201-78468 naked his on
19 December 1966 for full details known to his about LIMICRY-6 and Subject of

about two years ago, they could have blocked completely the view of this
base's working window by making the wall a few inches higher. Since they did
not do this, it would seem to indicate that they are not aware that their

1. SUMMARY OF PROJECT ACTIVITIES AND REPORTING
A. The last regularly scheduled LIFEMTTY Progress Report, covering the
period 1 May through 31 July 1966, was forwarded to Headquarters as Reference
A. Noteworthy internal Project activities were reported in References B.
through D. while Mexico City Station's Request for the Renewal of Project
LIFEMTTY was forwarded with Rezine.
B. Throughout the period under review, Project LIFEMTTY continued to collect
operational information on the LIMENICK installation, the LIMENICK personnel
and their visitors. This activity was in consonance with various sections
of the RND as approved for Station Mexico City. The above cited program
is
established by the LIMENICK and the LIMENICK program, which was
coverage provided by the LIMETD, LILYRIC and LICALLA basehouses. In
addition, the LIMENTY Project provided effective support to other Station and
Headquarters (i.e. ANDOD and AMLETTER) activities through the exploitation
of the LIMENTAR public/photographic unit and the LIMENTY principal agent,
Raymond N. OBERING.

P. LIMPTY.4 - With the exception of the color prints, all of the above
cited operational film provided by the basehouses and the LENTRAL unit was
developed and printed by LIMPTY.4 at the LENTAL photographi laboratory.
In order to alleviate some of the pressure caused by recent adjustments in
the Station's NOACRE section, LIMPTY-4 also processed approximately 200
photographe enlargesents which normally would not fall within the scope
of this Project.

through the exploitation of the LIMMITY Principal Agent, Raymond H. OERINDS.
2. AGENT COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTACT
During the period under review, OERINDS was seen 33 times in regular
operational meetings by the underslown, and on 2 occasions by the local
RURIO representative, Hugh T. FRANCOTTZ. The meetings between FRANCOTTS
and GRENDS were attended by the LIMMITY Project Cass Officer and dealt
with the installation of a new PAKO print dryer in the LIMMITY photo
laboratory. In addition, OERINDS met four times, for extended periods,
and the overall time of the LIMMITY project was 1.5% (1.5%).
preter for the LCFLUMTER examinations afforded LIMMETS, -6,-9,-14,-13,
-26, and -27. No basic departures, other than the regular preplanned
changes in meeting sites and times, were made in the regular and alternate
communications channels to GERMIDE. It should be noted that an up-dated
concentrated emergency communication system for contact with OERINDS was
forward to Headquarters as PRGM-28938, dated 21 February 1966. This plan
includes a new verbal and physical home files and supervises previous

3. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, PROGRESS, ACHIEVEMENTS
a) SUMMARY - Throughout the reporting period, Project LIMMITY continued
to provide the vast majority of the operational photozrophe and physical
surveillance reports used in Mexico City Station's operations against the
LIMERCIX installation andi personnel. The LIMMITY coverage has proved to
be a major challenge for the development of the LIMERCIX installation
personnel: providing leads to, and confirming the identities of LIMERCIX
staffers and their visitors; verifying or providing leads to the relative
rank and specific intelligence service connecti on of various LIMERCIX
officers; keeping the Station abreast of construction changes in the LIMERCIX
installation, and the installation of a new PAKO print. The LIMERCIX
agents. During the three month period under review, Project LIMMITY's
basheouses provided 3,967 frames of operational photozgraphs (146 rolls)
as well as 650 pages of fixed surveillance reporte covering this target.
b) LIMNTAP - Throughout this period, the LIMENTAP mobile unit was
targeted against leaders and meeting-sites of the local Communist parties
as well as other targets of opportunity, specifically the leaders of the
LIMERCIX installation andi personnel. The LIMERCIX staffers were
photographs of numerous Communist officials, which are of value to both
the JIMTIGER program and the Station's recruitment/penetration program.
This unit provided 330 operational photographs, while the personnel attached
to this unit also regularly serviced 21 postal accommodation addresses used
by Mexico City Station, Headquarters, and the National National
City.
c) LIMINTAP - During this period, LIMINTAP was attended 1,147
years (15 to 17 years) and final film and daily observation reports covering
the arrival and departure of LIMERCIX personnel and visitors at the front
gate of that installation during the afternoon and rush-hours. In
addition, LIMENTAP-6, the LIMINTE basohouse keeper, served as the radio
dispatcher for several LIMERCIA surveillance operations.
d) LIMINTA - During this period, the LIMINTA basohouse provided 1,660
frames (56 rolls) of operational photographs, covering the same area and
other parts of the LIMINTA personnel. The LIMINTA personnel was
afternoon hours. In addition, the LIMINTC personnel prepared a detailed

a) LICALLA - Throughout this period, the LICALLA beahouse provided
photographic coverage of the garden and patio area of the LIDENICR
installation, an area where many of the officers, their families and
visitors
congregate. In providing this coverage, LICALLA produced 1160
individual photographic as well as regular, daily reports on the salient
activities in this area.
f) LIDENITY-4 - All the above cited operational fila (160 rolls, 4,297
frames) provided by the basehouses and the LIDENTRAP unit was developed and
printed by LIDENTYL-4 at the LIDENTY photo lab. As noted in paragraph 2
above, a new semi-automatic PAO print dryer was recently installed in the
1980s. The LIDENTRAP tube installation of this dryer, the Station's
modernization of the LIDENTY photo laboratory has been completed, (See
paragraph 5 of RMA-2765). The LIDENTRAP unit was developed and the LIDENT
program.
g. The RMA and H, OSENDE - running the reporting of the LIDENTRAP
system. The ALL-ities LIDENTRY P/A, operating as the account to the LIDINED,
LILYRIC, and LICALLA basehouses and bearing the agent handling responsibility
for the related personnel as well as handling the operators of the LIDENTRAP
mobile unit, LIDENTYL-4, and LIDENTY-19, a Station asset (translator) carried
under Project LIFETAT. Geronda's overall assignment involved at least twelve
clandestine agent meetings each week, in addition to his meetings with the
LIDENTPY Project case officer. It should be noted that ORDINDE also made
numerous and essential contributions to the sensitive ARNDOD deception
operation.
4. SECURITY
There have been no known incidents which adversely affected the security
of Project LIDENTY. During the period under review, LIDENTY-6, -9, -13,
-14, -26, and -27 were afforded LENTURTTER examinations, all with satisfactory
results.
5. CRANOIES AND PLANNING
As noted in paragraph 5 of reference A, Station is in the process of
increasing the hours of both the photosraphic and physical surveillance
coverage provided by the LIDENTRY operations during the week-days. At
least, the LIDENTY, the personnel are providing coverage from early morning
to late afternoon, the LIDENTY, the LIDENTY, the LIDENTY, the
LIDENTY, the LIDENTY, the LIDENTY, the LIDENTY, the LIDENTY,
the LIDENTY, have moved into the new LIDENICR building, it is anticipated
that they will be able to provide complete dawn to dusk coverage, the
Station's ultimate goal.

1. SCARRY OF PROJECT ACTIVITY AND REPORTING
The Inst regularly scheduled LIDEMTY Process Report covering the
period 1 August through 31 October 1965 was forwarded to Headquarters as
reference A. Selient interim activities and developments were in the
references B. through S. Throughout the period of 1965, Budget LIDEMTY
was completed by the Department of the 1960 on the LIDEMIX Installation,
the LIDEMICK personnel and their visitors, as well as various targets
of opportunity. This was achieved through the daily photographic and fixed
surveillance coverage provided by the LIDEMIC, LIDEMIC, and LIDALLA
basheuses and the LIDEMFA mobile unit. In addition, the LIDEMTY project
provided essential support to various other Headquarters (particularly the
NORD operation) and Station activitieswith the exploitation of the
LIDEMTY Principal Agent, Raymond H. Ochabona.

3. ACCOMPLIGENCES, PROGRESS, AMERICA
The meeting of the reporting period, Project LISTT
continued to provide the vast majority of the operational photographs and
physical surveillance reports used in Mexico City Station's operations
targeted against the LEMERIK installation and personnel. This activity
is in direct support of, and in consonance with, the current RCB as approved
for the Station. The LIRETY coverage has proved to be a most reliable
and reliable and reliable. The LIRETY coverage has been given by the
loss to, and confirming the identities of LEMERIK staffers and their
visitors; verifying the relative rank and specific intelligence service
connection of various LEMERIK officers) keeping; the Station aestest of
construction changes of the LIESIJK physical plant; and verifying reports
of Station access agents. During the period under review, the LESTT
bashouses produced 4,212 hours of the LIESIJK (2012) as well as C60 passes of
fixed and 100% of the LIESIJK observing this target.
b) LIMTRAP - Throughout this period, the LIEWTAP必beilent was
targetted against leaders and meetings-sites of the local concurrent parties
as well as other targets of opportunity. Specifically, LENTAP provided
up-to-date photographs of numerous consultant officials, which are of value
to both the LIGITIG prepara and the Station's penetration/remitment
pregram. The LIEWTAP unit and personnel also soultrated the
LIEWTAP and a business and by Mexico City Station, 10414, and total
field Station. The LIEWTAP was a member of the LIEWTAP
photographs.
c) LIMTRAP - The priority period, the LIMTRAP basedcause
proposed the LIMEI TVs (50 rolla) of operational film and daily observation
repreved averaging the arrival and departure of LEMERIK personnel and
visitors at the front gate of the installation during the attemon and early
evening hours. In addition, LIEWTAP, the LIEWTAP basehouse keeper, served
as the radio dispatcher on several LEMERACE surveillance operations. The
value and need of the LIEWTAP fixed-ratio dispatching base has been explained
in detail in previous LIMESTY Progress Reports.
d) LIMTRAP - During this period, the LIMTRAP has基本 provide period 1,542
frames (54 rolls) of operational photographs, covering the same area and
targets noted in the LIDITED section, but during the morning and early
achievements of the LIMESTY. LIEWTAP prepared a weekly report on the
exchanges and going of each LIMESTY report and contributed the majority of
this project's physical surveillance.
a) LICALA - Throughout this period, the LICALA basehouse provided
photographic coverage of the sanier and patio area of the LIMESTY in-
stallation, an area where many of the officers, their families, and visitors
congregate. In covering this area, LICALA produced 1,255 individual
photographs as well as regular reports on the activities of various officials
of experts and other organizations.
LIMESTY-4 - All the above noted operational film (155 cells, 4,616
frames) provided by the basehouses and the LIMESTAP unit was developed and
printed by LIMESTY-4 at the LIMESTT photo processing base. As noted in
reference A., much of the LIMESTT photographic lab equipment was scheduled to
be replaced during this period. with the advice of the local KAME
representative, both the LIEWTAP. Let's this mailing system and strip
printer were replaced. In addition, a new semi-automatic dres-type print
driver was cleared by the Station for installation in this base string
February 1255.

CONTINUATION OF
3 ECR ET
15214-25322
a) Davidon H. GERMEE - During the reporting period, GERMEE served
as the full-time LESTET F.A. operating as the cutout to the LENTED,
LILTRIC, and IICALLA beachuses and bearing; the agent handling responsibility
for the operators of the LENTRA' mobile unit as vell as LEXETY-4 and
LERTY-19, a Station asset (translator) carried under Project LIFAST. This
overall assignment involved at least twelve clandestine agent meetings per
month. The LENTRA's program was a "good" program to be a "good" program
GERMEE also made numerous and essential contributions to the sensitive
ARUCD operation. It should be noted that GERENDE's alertness in spotting
the PERIUMEN surveillance of one of the ARUCD accommodation addresses,
undoubtedly saved this sensitive deception operation from exposure by the
opposition.
4. SECURITY AND PROBLEMS
Other than the attempted PERIUMEN surveillance of the ARUCD accommodation
address noted above (which has neutralized by GERENDE's alertness), there
have been no known incidents which adversely affected the security of the
LIMETY project or the related agent personnel. While several minor ad-
ministrative problems arose, all such matters were resolved locally.
5. CHANGES AND PLANNING
a) One major operational change is planned for the ensuing period.
Upon completion of the new LEMOSIRE structure (see HMMA-25352, dated 10
February 1965), the Station vill move the present LILTRIC baselinee
personnel (LIEETPY 13, 14, 26 and 27) into that edifice rather than the
LIMETY project. The LIMY 13, 14, 26 and 27) into that edifice is a
modifications are: 1) To increase the hours of both the photocrephic and
physical surveillance coverage provided by the LILTRIC operators (dawn to
dusk) during the week days and 2) have LIMTEED provide phototrephic and
physical surveillance coverage on week-onds only, while remaining in and
ly
stand-by for radio-dispatching assignments. These changes were dictated by
the following:
1) The new LEMOSIRE building vill offer a much better vantage point
for both photosprachic and physical surveillance than does the present
complex which houses the LILTRIC and LIMITEED bases. Therefore, the
Station feels that the personnel occupying this new base should be
those possessing the highest technical skills and also those able to
provide the most thorough and complete coverage. Since the LIMITEED base
now has only one trained operator while the LILTRIC basehous has three,
which is not a single one.
2) Because it appears that the coverage of the LEMTRICK installation
will be a long-range and continuing requirement, the Station desires
to staff the new base with personnel of long-range potential. Since
LIMETY-6 is now almost 60 years old, it is obvious that he loses not
possess this potential; however, the LILTRIC agent complex happily
combines experienced personnel with youthful agents.
3) Finally, the social and financial status of the LILTRIC personnel is
much more compatible and consistent with the environment of the new
building than is that of the LIMITEED family.
While it is anticipated that these modifications and changes vill initially
cause various administrative and operational problems, it is believed that
all such adjustments can be handled locally.
b) The requisite copies of the FRO Part II pertinent to LIMETY-26
were forwarded to Headquarters with NEW-27505, at September 1965 along
with a request for a full Operational Approval for Subject for use as a cut-out
to the LIMITEE basehouse. LIMETY-27 was granted a Prosessional Operational
Approval on 06 January 1965 for use as a part-time baseline reporter/operator
at the LILTRIC installation.

SECRET
OCC 65-0119
1 4 JAN 1965
MEMORANDUM FOR:
Director of Logistics
ATTENTION:
Mr. Edward Deaison
SUBJECT:
LEMPITY, LIMOUSINE
REFERENCE:
Mexi 2159
1. In conversation with the Headguarter to officer concerned
with LIMOUSINE affairs, this Cifice was apprised of the
fact that the proposed transaction, outlined in reficence cable, would
be executed without resource to advice on the legal aspects of the
sale under Mexican law and with no intention to make LIMOUSINE's
commitment to this Agency legally binding. It is further intended
that LIMOUSINE's "promissory notes" be unsecured.
2. Should the proposed transaction be carried out in this
manner, this Agency would be unable to ceforce LIMOUSINE's
promise to pay his debt, and would have no legally cognizable instru-
ment to present to an executor of his estate should he die before
meeting his obligations to us. In addition, our right to continued
possession of the apartment would be tenuces at beel.
3. Thus it is planned to convey real state appraised at
$14,448 in exchange for $7,200 and a collection of unenforceable,
unsecured promises. It is hard to believe that in this case, opera-
tional security precludes closer protection of Agency assets.

graphic basehouses" represent an integral and significant part of the Station's
counteresplonage effort against the LIMERICK installation. These bases do
not produce Foreign Intelligence and should not be considered in such a light.

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH
S E C R E
HIMSA-1995
1705
5. Jaurin, the evening of 20 September the Station LIFEAT Cano Officer
was advised that GERENDE had been urrected to disconnect the LIVER.Y lines
and to transfer all LIFEAT equipment to a safe location. To further insure the
security of LIVERY, all LIVERY lines were pulled externally during the early
morning period.
5. At approximately 1000 hrs., 21 September, LIMEW informed the Chief
of Station that a contact of has (LIMEW*) had just informed him that L-10 (from
name) and the LIEINTRAP vehicle were being held by the Secret Service. LIMEW
stated that if L-10 was one of KUBARK's agents he would attempt to have his
contact in the Secret Service obtain his immediate release. LIMEW was told
that L-10 was, in fact, a KUBARK agent and that the Station would very much
appreciate his efforts to effect his release. A short while later LIMEW again
contacted the Chief of Station and informed him that it would be necessary for
documented ODACID official personally to contact a Commandante fun LIMON
of the Secret Service and that L-10 would then be released. According to LIMEW,
L-10 had told the Secret Service that he was carrying out his operational photo-
graphic assignment on a contract basis for ODACID; therefore, an ODACID
official would have to establish.
The proposed amendment later, the Secret Service amounts were roughing up
some of the unividinuta attending the rally; consequently, they were endeavoring
to make sure that no photographs were taken which could be used against them by
the Communists. L-10 and L-11, the LIEINTRAP driver who left the acon before
was detained, were just preparing to leave the area after taking five rolls of film
when a Secret Service agnt demanded a search of the vehicle on the suspicion that
it contained Communist propaganda. L-10, his camera with telephone lens and
the film were then discovered in the rear of LIEINTRAP. It was at this time that
L-10 was secured orally by the police officers of being a Soviet agent and later of
being a local Communist agent. After being taken to Secret Service Headquarters,
L-10 total LIMON, in private, about his association with ODACID and emphasized
that he certainly was not a Communist agent. LIMEW's source (possibly Com-
mandante LIMON), belown; that there may be some truth in L-10's statement,
contacted LIMEW. Based on the assumption and in part on fact, this is the
Station of the American DURY by the National Trade Commission.
8. The Station, realiagin that LIMPTY-10 had not committed an illegal
act by taking photo-piraps, decided that WARE should personally visit LIMON
and request L-10's release. WARE contacted LIMON and the sub-jefe of the
Secret Service, Raul MENDIOLLA Cercero, about 1230 hrs., 21 September,
identified himself as an ODACID official and told them that L-10 did from time
to time perform photographic assignments for ODACID, particularly in the
field of local Communist activities. WARE also told LIMON and MENDIOLLEA
that L-10 was never permitted to do any task which was illegal under Mexican
law and that if he had done so it was certainly not under the auspices of ODACID,
but on his own volition. They implied that L-10 had not done anything, illegal and
that all they wanted to be sure about was that L-10 was not a Communist agent, L-
10 was immediately released and the LIEINTRAP vehicle returned to him with all
equities of the United States.
9. While WARE was on his way to see LIMON at the Secret Service Head-
quarters, the Chief of Station was advised by the ODACID Security Office that
L-10 was being detained by the Secret Service. The Security Office was told that
WARE was presently investigating the matter and should be at the Secret Service
Headquarters at that time. By coincidence, WARE was talking to MENDIOLLEA
when the ODACID Security Office phoned to inform him that WARE was taking care
of the matter. It was learned later that MENDIOLLEA is a brother-in-law of the
local investigator employed full time b. the ODACID Security Office. This was how
ODADIC became involved in the incident. To the best of the Station's knowledge, the
ODADIC Security Officer has said nothing more about the incident and, at the time,
did not attach any particular significance to it or seem especially concerned about

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

L-10's statement that he did some photographic work for ODACID. There was no
newspaper or other publicity pertaining, to L-10 or LIENTRAP.
10. During his visit to Secret Service Headquarters WARE discovered that
L-10 had not been booked or formally charged with an illegal act and that neither
LIMON nor MENDIOLÉA could recall L-10's name. L-10 was not placed in jail
durin; the 26 hours he was at Secret Service Headquarters but, rather, was permitted
to remain in the Secret Service agents' duty room. No briès were necessary to
obtain his release; however, per LIENW's request, $500.00 peoss were given to
LIMEW to give to his source. LIMEW said that in addition to notifying him about
L-10's detention, the source was also responsible for all equipment and film being
returned intact to L-10.
11. TESSAROLO was advised, as soon as LIMEW became involved in the case
that the criminal lawyer should not pursue the matter any further. Two bottles of
scotch whiskey were given to the lawyer through TESSAROLO for the few tasks he
had already performed.
12, After his release, L-10 reported that he was not interrogated and that he
did not reveal any data about other operations he has worked on nor did he give the
names of anybody connected with operational activities. Based on the developments
in the case, the Station has no reason to doubt the veracity of L-10's statement. L-
10 was reprimanded for his use of statements to the Secret Service about being
employed by ODACID. Is was told that the revelation of such employment was to
be made only by the Station and that henceforth he is never to use such a cover
story. L-10 was also reprimanded for his lack of judgment in remaining in an area
where there was a strong concentration of police; it is believed safe to assume that
L-10 will never make this same mistake again.
13. In retrospect, it is important to note that L-10's use of the ODACID
employment story is possibly difficult for his not been; interrogated and thus
completely the fact that he has a kind and individuals. This case has pointed out to the
Station the desreability of having casual contacts in the Secret Service and other
local police-type organizations so that the Station, rather than ODACID and ODENY,
in the first to learn of incidents of this type. Considering the multifarious activities
handled by the Station, it must be assumed that the police will occasionally appre-
hend an agent and that the Station must be geared to handle such emergencies.
14. The Station is allowing a one month's cooling off period for the LEN-
TRAP vehicle and LIEMPTY-10. The vehicle will then be painted another standard
color and re-registered in the State of Mexico. After these security precautions
are observed, the Station sees no reason why carefully selected photographic sur-
veillance operations should not continue with L-10 as a wiser and more prudent
LEINTRAP operator.

CATION READING
None, for Head quarters in formation and files only.
SYNOSIS OF DEVELOPMENTS
R.C. 437 - 437-11/16
1. Du ring the period cove red by this Report, this new Case Officer, Quinten
N. OUSLER, assumed operat ofial direction of several LIPSICK #ssets (Oliver
G. SCANTLING, Raymond H. GERENDE, LIMITED: EICALLA, LIEITRAF and
several suppo r agents), the LijERSEY survey Iliance to cam and the LILYRIC Base.
The Station has continued to use SCANTLING, primarily, to follow up LIMESA
leads obtained from LIFIEAT and the photogra phle bases; however, no positive
returns have been realized from his prodigious efforts except the collection of a
100% of the total of operational technologies. The LIFIEAT is a direct direct
potal agent responsible for the photographe bases, LIEITRAF, LijERSEY
and until 10 December 1958 handled the LIFIEAT/BCMORNING and LIFIEAT/
Cuba in Exile operations. The LijERSEY surveill ance team has been used sparingly
for pretext investigations and routho that state your llaune is lower, a principal agent,
Si mon D. CLACKETT, is currently being trained in Head quarters to assuine the
full-time direction, control, training and development of the LIEFESY team. The
new project, LEMPTY, combining all the assets discusied in this report was
submitted to Headquarters on 8 October 1958 with requeste dproject year appr oval
period from 1 December 1958 through 30 Nov ember 1959. An operational security
review of Raymond II. GERENDE's activit less was forwarded to Headquarters is an
at tachment to HIMA-11368, 22 October 1958.
ACCOUNT OF DEVELOPMENTS - OLIVER G. SCANTLING SEGMENT
2. Agent in formation - Oliver G. SCANTLING has continued to perform his
assigned tasks in an outa anding manner. SCANTLING's poise, common sense,
education, isology and native ability for r the pursuit of clundiest activit tes
make him one of the most valuable support, assets available to the Mexico City
St ation. The fact that S CANTLING has full time overt occupation as Chief
Enginee r and Production Manager for a local manufacturing company adds to
his long-range potential as a KUBARK agent. On two occasions dur ing the past
six months SCANTLING has indicated to his Case Officer that he would like to
resign from his overt position and devote full time to his KUBARK opie rational
duties; however, the Case Officer has discurraged him from doing this on the
basis that he has more long-range potential when his cover occupation is legitimate.
The final report was to be made of the new project. The first part of the
Station, but not sufficently so to warrant his registration from the
monthly salary; in his overt job is in excess of $800.00 U. S.). The only
significant limitation that S CANTLING has evident do it is present C: se Officer
is his occasional delay in prepar ing writt en reports of investigations and other
m att ers requir ing reports for the fles. However, this im itation gradual aly is
being overcome and it is expected that SCANTLING's reports will continue to
be fa tual, comprehensive and soon will be promptly submitted,
CS
3. Secur ity Developments - SCANTLING is constantly under a conside able
amount of expos iure and pressure when following up LIMESA leads obtained from
LIFIEAT and the photographe buses. Since t me is always of the essence when
using such perishable leads, SCANTLING frequently is directed to make appr aches
to individuals performing services for the LIMER RICK target after routine, and
sometimes only cursory, investigation. The rotere, the possibility always is exists
of his entanglement in an undesirable secur rity incident. This neces sarily

is a calculated risk which both SCANTLING a and the Stat ion must take if penetration
of the primary target is achieved, whether tcclinically or by a recruitment in place.
It is to, SCANTLING's credit that he has not yet become involved in an in nctdent which
the Stat ion feels has compromised into and/or alerted the target of KUDA RK's many
operational efforts against them. The closest S CANTLING has come to being compro-
In ised and to being ident fied as a PIPR IME agent stems directly from the LIPSTICK
surveillance team flap of June 1958. The off the use used by the surcill ance team was
rented by SCANTLING in his true name at the time that he was leader of the team.
Not the slightest in clation, however, has been uncov ered which points to SCANTLING
his a target of investigation by a local police service. SCANTLING and the Stat ion
have been alert and will continue to watch closely for any sign of local 1 police and other
opposition Int erest in his act ites.
4. O p orational Success and Effectiveness - Briefly discussed below are some
of the many operational activity is to which SCANTLING participate during the period
covered by the is report.
A. JUARCASTRO (201-7) - SCANTLING continued seeing CASTRO thought
September 1958 follow the last faint gl Iners of m unting the original LIMESA/
MK LIGHTING op e ration th rough CASTRO. As late as September 1958 possibilities
still existed, or appear ed to exist, that CASTRO would complete his work in the

INDEPING CAN BE JUDGED
BY QUALIFIED NO DESQ ONLY
Mexico City in December 1958 and Janaury 1959, it was considered appr projrate
for SCANTLING to handle LIMITED, LICALLA and LIENTRAP. Although this
pro cured defeats some compartmentation principles, it was the only manner
in which the Station could maintain efficncy with the three operations listed
above. SCANTLING has known the agents involved with LIMITED, LICALLA
and LIENTRAP for several years. In fact, he was at one time the agent in
cha rge of these three operations.
5. Operational Methods Evolved During the Period - The VIDALES operation
(see parag rapn 4 (C) above) indicated to the Stat lon the necess tity for r thorough
briefings and discussions with the agent making an approach to a target. This can
hardly be described as a new operational met hod, but it does se serve to (1111
strate
the
cin in un em efforts that should be followed. The forthcoming LINITENT IV
operation who rein SCANTLING must recruit the lindrol of the ta reger's building
is offering SCANTLING and the Stat ion the opportunity to prepare the thorough guly for
SCANTLING's recr ut ment pit cl. The excellent documentation prepar el by
URIOOT and the story being created by SCANTLING and the Stat ion should increase
the butt in average on SCANTLING's cold approaches. (See HMMA-1136, 22
(1111) 1136, and HMMW-7038, 21 November 1958, for additional details on
this Subject.
In a general sense, one other conclusion can be made about a ny Station's
support apparatus - where t technical and photograph opcration s are poss ihe,
the utility of the information obtained is enhancd consider ably by accurate, to
comprehensive and timely casing reports, SCANTLING, as previously mented,
is an excellent asset for this type of support.
6. Administration - SCANTLING's contract expires on 15 February 1959,
As of that die SCANTLING will have received an annual sulary of $3,600, 00 U. S,
for two years. The Stat ion plans to raise his annual compens ation to $4,000. 09
U.S. No other significant a dminl strat ive problems exist.
7. Outlook for Future Development - Station plans call for the continued
ut Litization of SCANTLING in the same manner as he is presently being used.
The Station will keep SCANTLING as an independent asset and, It is hoped, resist
the temptation to make him a principal agent in Charge of numerous sub-agents. It
is believed that SCANTLING is the type of support asset that can be wo triwh ile
to the Station for my years to come and that every effor: should be made to protect
his security and value to KUBA RK.
ACCOUNT OF DEVELOPMENTS - RAYMOND II, GERNEDSE SEGMENT
8. Agent Information - Aside from the agent in formation giv en in HMMA- 11368
22 October 1958, the only significant and development was GERNEDSE's Decenber 1958
marriage to a U. S. educated girl of Dutch citiz enslih. The $ 300,00 U. S, for the
purchase of two plane tickets as a wedung girt to GERNEDSE was designed to
impress GERNEDSE with the fact that KUBARK thinks highly of him as an indivi dual
and that KUBARK has a great interest in his intelligent ceece reer. GERNEDSE is at
the age and stage in life where he is beginning to wonder just what the future holds
for him. In the near future, the Station will propose a salary raise for GERNEDSE

9. 5
Securit y Devel opments - Again, the Information on this subject was covered
adequately in HMMA-11368, GERNEDE was relicved of his LIFEAT/BGMORNING
and LIF EAT/Cuban ExiLs duties on 10 December 1958. This, of course, was
in line with recomendations contained in HMMA-11368 and represents a definite
security improvement, GERNEDE was told that LIFEAT/BGMORNING was being
remintated because it had not been productive of enough significant Information and
that LIFEAT/Cuban ExiLes was a being terminated because c the occupants of the target
apartment had moved (Note: This was true where the Cu bans are concerned.)
Additional scour ity impervenents will be made when in Simon D, CLACKETT returns
to Mexico and relieves G ERENDEL of ressons billyt for the LIFERSE Y sur velline ance
cream.
10. 0 perational Success and Effecti venses - B briefly reviewed below are the
separate operationat activi les which GERNEDE managed during the period covered
by this report:
A. LIMITED - This base functioned smoothly, securely and effi ciently
dur ing the period July through December 1958. The base oper antor, LIEMPTY/
domen strated his usual competence and devotion to duty, in addition to the
primary objective of taking photograph s of individuals of interest, L/6 also
prepared detailed daily logs on the arrivals and departures of a l l target
per somene 1, weckly reports of workers activities at the LIME RICK install tation,
per formed three one-man surveillance of Moxlcens working at LIMERICK in
an effort to to1dently chem by name and home addr ess, and provided SCANTLING
with information on LIMERICK construction. Dur ing this six-month period,
LIEMPTY/0 took approx intenlely 800 photographs from the LIMITEIDE base.
LILYRIC - This base is operated by LIFEMPTY/s 13 and 14, with LIMERT
12
pering as a cutour beryce in the base and GERNEDE. LIEMPTY/14 does most
of the photograph y and reporting for the base since LIMERTY/13 has a regular

employees. LICALLA is so situated that photographs can be made of target
for some! in the garden area of LIME RICK. CIEMPTY/1 is the base opera ror
for LICALLA and in the Stat on's option performs his jobs in an outst anding
name r. As reported in IMMA-11368, LEMPTY/9 is a brother of former
LIPSTICK/47 (the first LIPSTICK surveillance team member of the
June 1958). No repre cuss ions, or indications of any impending ones, have
res ulted in this family relat lonship. This, certainly, is the major security
problem faced by L/9 during this reporting period. L/9 and lhis fa mily soon
will have to vacate the LICALLA base for the period of time required to remodel
it. The Station is quite sure that L/9 does not know that his covert employer
owns the LICALLA base and the three adjoining houses and every effort is
being made to preserve this secret from L/9, (See HIMA-12032, 28 Ja nuary
1959, for a more detailed explanation.) Of course, during the remodeling of
LICALLA there will not be any LICALLA reporting or photographs. In addition
to the proposed rule, the LIMPERICK's proposal is a "month period, the
LICALLA base also prepared we cely reports on LIM ERICK garden activ lites.
These reports indicate which LIMERICK employees are seen together each day,
which vehicles different employees are accustomed to using construction activites
and other matters which appear of significanee to L/9.
D. LIENTRAP - LIENTRAP continues to be a worthwhile Station asset,
Approximately 1,400 clandes inie photographs have been made of numerous
targets during this reporting period and LIENTRAP type activities will undoubtedly
remain one of the Station's best investigative assess. As explained in the Field
Pro ject Out line, forwarded to Headquarters on 8 October 1958, the Stat on is
of the opinion that the LIENTRAP vehicle should be replaced as soon as possible.
Nearly four months have elapsed without receiving Headquarters authority to
replace the vehicle. The security sit nation is even more coute now than at the
time of the request. LIEMPTY's 10 and 11 do an excellent job on LIENTRAP
ope rations,
E. LIJERSEY - This operation can be chara tcrized as somewhat dormant
for the July - December 1958 period. Because of GERENDE's other important
activit ies, he did not have the time to train and work w ith the surveillance team,
Also, the Station consider ed that it would be stretching security it just a bit too far
to have GERENDE engaged in surveillance at the same time at hie was handling
the photographic base hois es and performing monitoring chores for LIFEAT/
BONORNING and LIFEAT/ Cukan Exiles. The expected arrival of Simon D.
CLACKET in Apr i and his relieving GERENDE of LIJERSEY will enable
the Station to t a nia, within a year, an office nent mobile surveyill ance team.
At present, LIEMPTY 19/19, 10 and 17 compose the LEMPTY/19.
F. LIFEAT - Until 10 December 1958, GERENDE used as monitor
in the base house con aluing LIFEAT/BCMORNING and LIFEAT/Cuban
Exiles. In addition to living in the base house, GERENDE also strerbed
the majority of the BICMORNING and Cukan Ex le tape. He performed numerous
these jobs satisfactorily even though his efficiency was hand clapped by numerous
other duties. Relleving GERENDE of his LIFEAT arrives enables him to devote
more time to his other operations in wha corresponding incresce in the securitio
of all his activities.

G. LIEMPTYS/4 and 5 - LIEMPTY/ 4 does a truly professiona I Job of
dcy cloping and printing the base house photograph S. No significant developments
occurred in reJation to L4 except that OUSL ER met directly with him during
the December 1958 period that GERENDE was away from Mexico City.
LIEMPTY/5, L/4's wife, continued doing routine translations in a very compo-
tent manner.
11. Administration - Other than the fact that LIJERSEY and the above-
mentioned portions of the LIPISTICK pro jects we re combined into this new project,
LIEMPTY, there is nothing of signiflicance to report to flea daqur ters.
12. Outlook for Future Deve lopment - Although not meaning to be repott tie
by di success again in those recommendations made above, a summary of the Stat ion's
outlook on the future of the LIEMPTY GERENDE Segment is believed to be appropriate
W the the arrival of CLACKET in April, GERENDE will be free to devote full
time to photograpie his base house operations. GERENDE can do a lot to professionalize
these operations by preparing w r lten communications proc dures, by thoroughly
hcbrieffing base house operitors on the lrttr met hods of operation, by prep aring detail
security reviews on each base and by supervising the trial of new photographic
c chniques. GERENDE will continue to be used on occasions lonal sensitive in vestigations
to rent operationu hotel rooms and to perform other services for the Station which
will not Im pair the secur ty of his primary respon sbilities. It is planned that
CLACKET will put some life into the LIJERSEY survcillance team and that the
Station will so con have another first rate investigative group to support other Stat on
operations.

MEXGRANDUM FOR: CHH
SUBJECT
: Development of Physical Surveillance Assets in Mexico
REFERENCE
: WH/FI Memorandum of 14 October 1958
1. The subject of the recruitment of a physical surveillance team in
the United States for use in Mexico as well as other areas within wi has
long been a topic of discussion at Headquarters. While it is palpably ri-
diculous to consider the use of a surveillance team recruited and trained
in the United States and based in Mexico, operationally in other areas in
Latin America, the U.S. Government of the United States, which is in
the U.S. Government. Although one of the basic factory, the make-up of any
surveillance team is that ite members must be indigenous to the area of op-
eration, it would be possible to recruit such a team as suggested in 2a and
use this team in Mexico. However, I believe this would be time-consuming and
very expensive for the following reasons:
a. Machine runs have already been made to spot candidates within
the Agency of the Mexican/American type for the INUEGA/LIPUST project, with
negative results.
In order to make it attractive to young men of the caliber
desired, we would have to offer some kind of a career with a starting salary
of somewhere between the GS 7 and GS 9 level, plus travel and allowances.
Without attempting to even estimate this cost one can see that the figures for
a team of fifteen would run into six digits.
c. It would take a minimum of three months for a recruiter to move
into the southwest area and spot, contact, develop and recruit a team of
fifteen.
with
d. Once a team of suitable candidates was recruited, it would
then take a minimum of another three months to train these candidates in
basic trade craft and surveillance techniques.
e. Upon completion of the training period, the candidates would
have to be moved individually into the area of operation to become familiar
with this area, the language, people, and atmosphere in general, etc. This
would take another three months minimum.
f. After completion of the area familiarization period, the team
would have to be assembled and put through various surveillance exercises as
a unit to check them out prior to actual operation.

g. There would be other problems confronting such a team from a
security standpoint, such as cover, credentials, which would always pose a
threat to the operation.
2. To -um up, it would appear that the proposal in 2a of reference
is not feasible because of the time and expense involved plus the always
latent security hazard.
3. I agree with paragraph 2 b of reference. Not only should the
personnel of the surveillance team be recruited at the station, but as out-
lined in paragraph 3 it should be relatively easy to find suitable candidates.
For example it is proposed under the new LIMPIT project (this consists of
the remainder of the non-blown LIFRILLS and the LIVERSETS) to recruit a
physical surveillance team. Two of the station's outstanding indigenous
agents, Seintling and Serenda, are user this project and both are capable
of spotting, developing, and recruiting agents.
4. The 1.2 average width paragraph 3b, e. and believe that Headquarters
should make every effort to find an experienced end competent case officer
to fill chower's slot as the outside surveillance case officer.

MEMORANDUM FOR: OWH
SUBJECT:
Development of Physical Surveillance Assets in Mexico
1. On 8 October 1958 a meeting of representatives of SR Division
and CI Staff was held, attended by the undersigned, to discuss means for
building up physical surveillance assets in Mexico. The SR and CI repre-
sentatives pointed out that their current and projected work on BIRMORINO
and their cases requires a considerable strengthening of physical surveil-
lance assets, and it was the consensus that these assets would be used
far into the future on Soviet targets. It was further agreed that since
the LIVESTICK operation has encountered difficulties this year, now assets
should be sought.
2. Various approaches to the problem were discussed, the most viable
of which were as follows:
a. Recruiting of teams or basic elements for teams in the Mexican
colonies of the southwestern U. S.
b. Dispatch of a new case officer to Mexico with the sole and
specific duty of developing and running the new teams.
c. A combination of a and b.
3. Initially, it is believed the dispatch of a new case officer to
Mexico would be the most successful and give the best immediate results,
for the following reasons:
A. Handquarter and Station records contain the names of numerous
cleaners, and the contacto who could be clearvd and through whom
introductions could be made to persons suitable for surveillance work.
Hitherto these have not been fully exploited owing to the heavy workload
on Station personnel and the unpaired functioning till recently of
the LIVESTICK group. Some of these contacts were felt out as recruiters
and spottors in years past but the matter was never pushed since the
need was not so great as now.
b. A now cash officer is needed because the present Station staff
is still too busy to devote the amount of time needed to build carefully
and train thoroughly the new assets.
c. The now assets will require the full time direction and
coordination of a case of ficer who has no other responsibilities. In
this connection, it would be advisable to try to select, train and
utilize at least twelve new agents as soon as possible.


- 2 -
d. In brief, a replacement of the farmer physical surveillance
leader is indicated, but a more mature and competent case officer is
needed.
4. Plan a, recruitment in the U. S., should not be dismissed from
consideration. It would take longer than the other plan but might be
beneficial in enabling the new agents to be trained in the U. S. They
would then have to spend time getting into Mexico and familiarize themselves
with operations and operational climate there. This plan, however, presents
the need for the development of the program, including in the U. S.
SR Division has offered to be of whatever assistance to the exam, but there
is no indication they could do any better at this than when
is
-5. It may be of interest to you to know that the SR representatives
said the best work done anywhere in the world on the KONGRIND in case, which
has wide international ramifications, was done by LIKAYAK-2 in Mexico.

house adjacent to the LIMENICK target installation was vacant, LIPSTICK-19
was contacted immediately to investigate the property. He repurted that
it was a one-story house(duplex) in very poor condition which was being
repaired by the owner for rental. He further reported that from the
first time of the construction, LIMENICK's first time of the construction was
possible and, if he had understood the LIMENICK language, he would have
been able to understand several conversations which were going on between
LIMENICK officers in the game area of the compound. LIPSTICK-19 also re-
quired for the room of this house it was a distance of only approxi-
mately fifty minutes. LIPSTICK building arrows last roofs with no
obstructing partitions adjacent to a small wall and several o strands of
barbed wire, all totalling about four or five feet high between the last
roof and the LIMENICK building.
2. Based upon this favorable report, refer to the following:
to Headquarters requesting authorization for the house. Two day-
time of the building was approved as approval to rent the house. Con-
sequently, LIPSTICK-2 (the average standard married man available to the
Station, with the exception of LIDENITY, who would fit into the area) was
approached and requested to rent the house. This posed a considerable
problem to LIPSTICK-21, since the house has only two cedrooms and he already
enough to be able to attend the house. The house was a single
giving birth to a third child. Further, he had a very comfortable house
(a duplex which he shared with nis brother-in-law at a pre-devolution
rent) which he would never be able to again acquire after this operation
was terminated. He did, however, agree to take the house and it was

6. At present we plan to allow LIPSTICK-21 considerable time to get
settled securely into his new quarters before starting any operational
efforts. After this waiting period is over anu we feel that we can
securely commence operations, we plan on using the base for the following
efforts:
A supplementary photographic base. In this connection the
request for additional Exacts and spotting scopes previously made
should be expedited. It is anticipated that much every
tion will be developed by this photographic work showing the various
associations between the people when they are at play in the compound
which can never be determined from the LIPSTICK-LIMITED coverage.
The LIPSTICK-LIMITED coverage is a major challenge for
within the compound and can be photographe for possible identifica-
tion by the ASDIPPERS. Items which are loaded into the automobiles
for transportation to unknown points may be identified through this
coverage. Further, should LIPSTICK-LIMITED be terminated for any
reason, we would be able to continue some coverage from this base.
b. Observation by LIPSTICK-21 of the buildings and the activities
in the compound will furnish valuable information on the daily living
boots and the building.
c. The LIPSTICK-LIMITED base, presently being occupied by LINGH-
FIN, is about 75 yards away from the LINGHINK target while LIPSTICK/
LIGALLI is only about fifty feet. This base may assist the Head-
quarters technicians, who periodically use the LIPSTICK/LIDMIX
base, for reasons of proximity and the use of their equipment from
a differant direction. The exact use of the LIPSTICK/LIGALLI base
in this respect must be determined by the headquarters technicians
who are not responsible for the development of the LINGHINK.
The examinations in the LINGHINC compound are audible to someone
who is listening from the maid's room. Naturally street noises and
extraneous sounds interfere considerably with this eavesdropping so
that the employment of some parabolic microphones and recorder must
be used for optimum results.
e. Should future operations provide the opportunity to install a
transmitter microphone (resonant cavity) in some item carried into
the LINGHICK target, LIPSTICK/LIGALLIA would serve as an excellent
base since it has direct line of sight to the back of the LINGHICK
target.

f.
Prelimina y investigation reveals that the possibility does
exist that phy: local access may be obtained to the LIMZKICK target
from LIPSTICK/LICALIA. This investigation will be intensified and
a full report, together with available photographs, will be sent to
Headquarters for study by PEARSON and NILIS as to the feasibility
of LIPSTICK-21.
7. As stated in para graphs two and three above, LIPSTICK-21 has undergone
considerable personal. Acrifice to accommodate this Station in this opera-
tion. It has always been the practice to pay a base house operator &
starting salary of approximately $120,00 U.S. per month, since the work
of operating a base house is almost full-time. LIPSTICK-21 now earns
$64,60 U.S. for work of approximately four hours per day. It is therefoe
requested that this station be authorized by cattle to increase the salary -
of LIPSTICK-21 to $120,00 U.S. per month.
