Action Required:
For Your Information
1. Following are the results of the debriefing of AMFAUNA-14 in
the JNWAVE area from 22 November to 2 December 1963.
2. AMFAUNA-14 did not leave her apartment all day Sunday, 6 Oct.
(Non Monday, 7 October, she went to work as usual. When she arrived, she
found a letter waiting for her which had been forwarded to her office
from her accommodation address; it was in AMFAUNA-1's handwriting and
contained nothing of any interest, so she was sure there was a secret
writing message on it.
3. At 1255 hours two men arrived at the office, one about 45 years
old and short, who from his appearance might have been a bus driver,
and the other a very young dark-skinned man. They walked into the
office vestibule and told the guard that they wanted to see AMFAUNA-14.
The guard came into the office to give AMFAUNA-14 the message, and the
two men followed right behind. They told AMFAUNA-14 that she had to
come with them to identify an arrested person. AMFAUNA-14 said that
she would have to ask her supervisor for permission to leave, because
the person was not a person who was not a person who was not a
and the two men followed her in. The supervisor told her that it
would be all right for her to go, but said that she should check in by
phone if there were any difficulty. AMFAUNA-14's father and uncle,
both of whom work in the same office, asked whether they could come
with her. The men said no, because she would be coming right back;
they said they were taking her to "G-2" headquarters in La Vibora.

4. AMFAUNA-14 tried to dispose of the letter she had just re-
ceived from AMFAUNA-1 by leaving it on the desk of a fellow employee
together with some potatoes and a carrot for cover, but the men would
not let her. She did, however, manage to destroy a page from her note-
book containing telephone numbers.
5. At the DSE headquarters in Villa Maristas, AMFAUNA-14 was
turned over to a militiamoman who had her strip and performed a body
search on her. She was fingerprinted and photographed and her biographic
data were taken down, after which she was locked in a cell which had
an adjoining private bath. Nothing else of importance happened for
the rest of the day.
6. During her four-day detention period, AMFAUNA-14 was handled
by the following DSE officers: C.I.C. C.A. HRC 1919 E.C.C T.A.C. C.A.

name include RCSA-0989 of 23 April 1963 showing that one Maria CARCANO
Arujo (born 7 December 1935) travelled to Chile in March and April 1963
on a diplomatic passport. An AMOT report of 27 September 1962 mentions
one Antonia CARCANO Araujo as a communist in charge of vigilance, and
living at 47 Artes St., Casablanca. There also appears to be a Maria
ARADJO (born about 1903) who is an old-time Communist living at Artes
the 1960s. The 1960s were the most important, but the most important
this neighborhood in hopes of finding a relative of the CARCANO or
ARADJO families whose physical description matches that of "Carlos,"
AMPAUNA-1 has also interviewed Col. VENTULA in the WAVE arena. VENTURA

boy's name. He says that he seems to remuber that the boy's father
was connected with one Jose LODEZ and his father. He was a

14's interrogation. She never happened a few times during AMFAUNA-
saw him on television advertising his name at this time, but later
then as Jose Antonio FERNANDEZ Weneri. She does not believe that this
is his true name, because it is her understanding that DSE officers use
aliases in their public appearances. He is about 5'11" tall, slender,
with darkish skin and black hair combed straight back. He has very
large green cold eyes. He was born about 1939 and appears to be un-
educated, with a cynical and vulgar manner. He wears civilian clothes,

7. At about 1800 or 1700 hours on Tuesday, 8 October, AMFAUNA-14
was brought into ABAD's office for her first interview. ABAD began
by asking if she knew why she was there. AMFAUNA-14 replied that she
had no idea. ABAD observed that that was strange, because he had
judged her to bo an able and intelligent woman. 10000
8. Honestly believing that she might have been denounced by the
jealous wife of her lover, ManuelFECOMPANIONI, AMFAUNA-14 suggested
that it might be a personal matter. 10000

10. AMFAUNA-14 said that she knew the man as Luis "NEGRO" and
not recognised the name VILLAR Neget.
11. ABAD told AMFAUNA-14 that NEGRET was then under detentior and
had implicated AMFAUNA-14 in his confession. ABAD wanted to know what
AMFAUNA-14's connection with NEGRET had been. AMFAUNA-14 said that
NEGRET had been in her house once, and once in her mother's.
12. At this point in the interrogation, ABAD was called away and
AMFAUNA-14 was returned to her cell. Two hours later the interrogation
was resumed.
13. ABAD picked up where he had left off, and asked AMFAUNA-14
what connection she had had with Angel BRINGA. AMFAUNA-14 said that
she had known BRINGA8 no better than she had known NEGRET. ABAD said
that she was lying and urged that she cooperate. AMFAUNA-14 promised
that she would cooperate. ABAD said that NEGRET had told the DSE that
AMFAUNA-14 had had sexual relations with BRINGA8, and AMFAUNA-14 denied
the allegation.
14. The interrogation was again interrupted, and AMFAUNA-14 was
returned to her sell. When she returned to the interrogation room,
she saw that ABAD had an envelope containing what she recognized to be
papers taken from her apartment, including airline passenger manifests,
deciphering material, instructions for using the deciphering material,
and insurance policies and personal papers belonging to AMFAUNA-1.
AMFAUNA-14 now realized that it was time for her to pretend to to

cooperate with the D&E, as AMFAUNA-1 had briefed her to do in such a
situation.
15. AMFAUNA began by telling her that she was in a very serious
situation. Arouase he knew that she had had very close connections
with a KRAKE agent. ABAD asked whether AMFAUNA-1 was identical with
"Julio," AMFAUNA-14 said that AMFAUNA-1 had been known as "Julio,"
ABAD then wanted to know whether NEGRET had been working with "Julio,"
AMFAUNA-14 denied this. ABAD asked whether NEGRET had known "Julio,"
AMFAUNA-14 denied this too, but volunteered the information that "Julio"
had provided NEGRET with mail facilities, and that AMFAUNA-14 had been
done to the next week. AMFAUNA-14 did NEGRET know of "Julio's" exist@nce, ABAD
wanted to know. AMFAUNA-14 had been told the head not, that she had brought
KOREIT mail and money which she has been given "Julio," and had picked
mail up from him and delivered it to "Julio," but that NEGRET had
never known "Julio's" identity.
16. The truth about AMFAUNA-14's relations with NEGRET and BRINGAB
according to her statements to her KUBARK case officer in November 1863
in the JUNAVE area, is as follows:
(a) In about mid-1983, AMCOG-2 asked AMFAUNA-14 to serve as
outout between herself and an unidentified agent, and AMFAUNA-14
agreed. AMFAUNA-14 was driven to the meeting site, which was on the
sidewalk in front of a textile factory near Calle 100 in Marianao, by
AMCOG-3's chauffeur, a Spaniard named "Segundo." This agent introduced
himself to AMFAUNA-14 only as "E1 *NEGRO", and AMFAUNA-14 described
herself to him as an employee of an unidentified embassy. For contact
purposes, "E1 Negro" gave her the telephone number 29-4900 or 20-4900.
(b) Later, when AMFAUNA-14 began to trust "E1 Negro" more,
she gave him the telephone number of her mother. She learned that
"R" Negro's" true name was Tala Raulio VILLAR Negret, and that he
lived in a small room in the rear of the textile factory. The telephone
number which he had given her was always answered by a woman whose
name she learned to be "Maximina."
(c) VILLAR Negret was born about 1928, and was about 5'11"
tall with broad shoulders and a strong build. He had black way hair,
brown eyes, an olive skin, and a face marked by acne. AMFAUNA-14
never learned anything about his family directly from him, but DSE
officers told her that he was married with one child, and that his IN
parents lived on a farm in Pinar del Rio Proceding INCE
(d) VILLAR Negret was a member of the Accion NevUcionaria
Democratic, which AMFAUNA-14 understands to be a successor organization
to the AAA of Aurelia SANCHEZ Arango. He had formerly belonged to
vs other persons of the organization, but more recently had been
used by the American American Association. He was a man in
*structions and money from AMCOG-2, and picked up his intelligence
reports which she delivered to AMCOG-2. She understands that AMCOG-2
sent these reports via diplomatic channels to Fran AEZ inAlmania
in the, divided them to an individual identified only as
Injury provided, The last contact which AMFAUNA-14 had had with
H1 Negro* was in mid September 1983 when he passed her a report which
he said concerned a missile base, and a book on Communist infiltration
in Colombia.
(c) Once when "E1 Negro" was sick he sent his cousin to
most with AMFAUNA-14. This cousin was Angel BRIANGA, an employee of
the way equipment company at R3rd and 0,1 Rama. Vedado, Ialaphone
$500. On various other subsequent occasions, BRINGS filled in
for "R" Negro."
(f) According to what the DSE officers told her, "E1 Negro"
was arrested about 1 October and was to be shot. AMFAUNA-14 asked her
DSE interrogators whether it would not be possible to reindoctrinate
"El Negro" instead of shoot him, but they told her that it was not
worth the trouble because "E1 Negro" was a person of low morals who

be shown to Angel BRINGAS when and 11 the 18 caught.
(g) On 12 or 13 October 1963, after AMFAUNA-14 had been re-
leased, she was telephoned at her place of employment by Angel BRINGAS
who told her guardedly that "El Negro" had been arrested and said that
he would like to send a female cousin of his to talk to AMFAUNA-14. A
meeting was arranged in the home of AMFAUNA-14's mother. The female
said he was a member of the 18th day of the 19th day of the 19th day of the
into hiding and wondered whether "the family with which she worked"
(the AMCOOS) could help him get into asy!m. AMFAUNA-14 said that she
doubted this, "Gladys" told AMFAUNA-14 that, in case it were possible
to do anything for BRINGAS, she should telephone "Gladys" with an
innocent message. It was understood that a meeting would take place at
1800 hours on the same day of the telephone call at the Ten Cent Store
Serd between 10th and 12th in Tuesday. He said that he not remember
Gladys" to the 19th day of the 19th day left with her mother.
(b) In spite of what AMFAUNA-14 told the DSE, AMFAUNA-1 had
had nothing to do with NEORET. AMFAUNA-14 had told this story to pro-
tect AMCO-3. NEORET had known that AMCO-3 was involved, and had once
had a meeting with her in her home. Nevertheless, AMFAUNA-14 briefed
AMCO-3 on the cover story which she had told the DSE and told her that,
in case she were ever arrested and questioned, she should admit having
talked to NEORET in her home, but deny having been involved in the
consciousions channel or knowing anything about it.
Station Comment: Luis Braulio VILLAR Negret appears to be
identical with YLAIS NEORES Villar (born 4 November 1930 in Consolation
del Sur, Pinar del Rio), who is carded as ACSI source No. 492 and
appears in AMBUD correspondence as National Coordinator of the Accion
Revolucionaria Democratica, "El Guajiro Ben Pachal, "The
Ceremony of the 19th day of the 19th day of the 19th day of the 19th day of
the 19th day of the 19th day of the 19th day of the 19th day of the
Pinar del Rio), President and founder of Accion Revolucionaria Democratica
and 1001 coures N. 195. The 1951 the Nation tracgs on Angel BRINGAS.
The 1965 Havana telephone directory has no listing dode 20-4900, L'OS
N-4900, 18 listed to KARKE FLASALIU "A.V. 32 #411. Marinago JNNAVE
has no traces on him. There's no listing under 70-5570. However,
under 70-5579 there is the Cubana de Ravos X y Poto, B.A.
#72, LA Rampa.)
19. ABAO appeared to be particularly interested in how NEORET and
"Julio" obtained their funds, and kept returning to this subject during
the interrogation.
18. ABAO then addressed himself to the contents of the envelope
and a suitcase found in AMFAUNA-14's apartment. He commented that all
these things appeared to belong to AMFAUNA-1 and his son, and asked how
they happened to be there. AMFAUNA-14 replied that AMFAUNA-1 and his
son, together with AMFAUNA-3, had been hiding for a few days in her
apartment because their usual hiding place had become unavailable.
19. ABAO wanted to know how and when AMFAUNA-14 had first met
AMFAUNA-1. AMFAUNA-14 replied that she had met AMFAUNA-1 in about
February 1963, that AMFAUNA-1 had regularly parked his car in a lot near
her office and that they had seen each other on the street frequently,
that AMFAUNA-1 had finally spoken to her, and that a friendship had
been able to be the same as the other. He said that he had been
a lie told to conceal the fact that it had been AMCUTLER-3 who had in-
troduced them.) She said that AMFAUNA-1 had been her lover until about
July 1963 when she broke up with him because he was too busy with
clandestine work to pay the proper amount of attention to her.
20. ABAO asked what part AMFAUNA-14 had played in AMFAUNA-1's
clandestine activities. AMFAUNA-14 replied that AMFAUNA-1 would some-
times telephone her late at night to invite her to go out for a ride,
and she would then find that AMFAUNA-1 was going out to have agent
meetings and wanted her along for cover. ABAO asked whom AMFAUNA-1 had
been meeting. AMFAUNA-14 mentioned a person known as "Gustavo" and

gave the physical description of AMFAUNA-24, whom she knew to be safely
out of Cuba. (She never knew AMFAUNA-24's true name.) She also mentioned
Manolo "VILLANANA, the true name of AMFAUNA-13 (whom she had known
only as AMFAUNA-1's business partner but when she thought she could
safely mention now that he was out of Cuba.) For good measure she added
a
notional name and physical descriptions.
31. Referring back to AMFAUNA-1's automobile, ABAD asked what
fied of a car he had driven. AMFAUNA-14 replied that it was a gray
chance of a car. He said that he said that AMFAUNA-1 had formerly parked it
mear her office, but said that she had not seen it recently. ABAD
asked where AMFAUNA-1's red car was, and she said she did not know. He
asked what the license number on this car was, and she said she did not
know. He never asked anything about the third car which AMFAUNA-1 had
obtained.
22. ABAD commented that the DSE had observed AMFAUNA-1 in his
automobile in the Havana dock area on 1 January 1963, having a meeting
with another person. (AMFAUNA-14 recalls that this other person was
AMFAUNA-24, and that he and AMFAUNA-1 had rendezvoused in the dock area
after an attempt to pick up AMFAUNA-1's radio.
23. With reference to the KUBARK agent known as "Julio", whom
they had recently identified with AMFAUNA-1, ABAD said that he knew
that "Julio" had left Cuba in October 1962 and believed that he had
gone to Europe, but he said he did not know whether "Julio" had gone
clandestinely or legally.
24. AMFAUNA-14 was asked about AMFAUNA-1's subsources in other
provinces, but she said she knew nothing about them. ABAD said he was
sure that AMFAUNA-1 had a good source on the Tala of Pinas. Whose war
name might be "Raul". ABAD also mentioned the name of a person who had
been shot about two weeks previously and who he believed had been work-
ing with AMFAUNA-1. (AMFAUNA-14 does not remember the name of this
person.)
25. ABAD asked if AMFAUNA-1's son had helped him in this clandes-
time work. AMFAUNA-14 replied that the son had been with AMFAUNA-1
frequently, but that she thought it was only because he was helping
AMFAUNA-1 with his business and that the son probably had had nothing
to do with clandestine work.
26. ABAD again turned to the envelope of papers found in AMFAUNA-14
apartment, and said he could see she was not cooperating with him. She
was not volunteering information, he said, but waiting to be asked
questions. ABAD said he was sure that there was much that AMFAUNA-14
could tell him spontaneously, and he intimated that there might be a
chance for her to rehabilitate herself.
27. ABAD asked her where the passenger lists came from. AMFAUNA-14
resplied that they had been left in her apartment by AMFAUNA-1, who
intended to instruct her later by SW what to do with them. She said
that AMFAUNA-1 had trained her in this system, and had left her his
materials, so that he could use her as a stop-gap communication link
while he was trying to reorganize his net.
28. ABAD told her that this was plainly not True, because some of
the lists were dated later than AMFAUNA-1's departure date. He said he
agreed they had been brought to AMFAUNA-14's apartment by AMCUTLER-2,
the second party was a 100% of the second party. The second party
(1) was true, according to AMFAUNA-14. AMCUTLER-2 and Colin COREOBO
had brought the passenger manifests to AMFAUNA-14's house at about 1630
or 1700 hours on 5 October, and had stayed about fifteen minutes. AT
1400 hours that smoe day, AMFAUNA-14 had had a meeting with AMFAUNA-39,
the first in two weeks, initiated by AMFAUNA-39 by means of a telephone
conference. The 123 mother who was serving as cutout between
AMFAUNA-39 had can be testing to ask whether she had received any
instructions from AMFAUNA-1 as to how to act in case of experimental
uprising, which a number of people in Cuba seemed to be expected about
the

(The DSE interrogators never at any time mentioned AWAUNA-39, or asked
her about this earlier meeting, so AWAUNA-14 concludes that she had not
been under intensive surveillance that day; either ACUTLER-2 had been
under surveillance on 5 October, or she herself had been under some kind
of periodic spot check.)
29. ABAD asked AWAUNA-14 how she had become acquainted with
ACUTLER-2, and AMFAUNA-14 replied that she had met AMCTTLER-2 through
AMFAUNA-15, the wife of a cousin of AMFAUNA-14 who is a prisoner on the
Icle of Pines.
30. ABAD then asked AMFAUNA-14 where her SW materials were, which
surprised AMFAUNA-14 because she had thought they had been found during
her house search and were part of the incriminating envelope which ABAD
was holding. AMFAUNA-14 told ABAD where to look for the materials, and
he sent somebody to get them.
31. ABAD wanted to know how AMFAUNA-1 and AMFAUNA-3 had gotten out
of Cuba. AMFAUNA-14 said she did not know. She said she understood they
were to get their instruction on the street once they had left her apart-
ment.
32. ABAD abruptly asked AMFAUNA-14 whether she knew anybody in
Layano, AMFAUNA-14 said she did not. ABAD then produced a photograph
of AMFAUNA-14 together with AMFAUNA-1 and AMFKE-29 and told her that she
had been in AMFWE-2's home in Luyano with AMFAUNA-1 on Saturday, 7 September
He asked AMFAUNA-14 whether AMFKE-2 were employed in an embassy. AMFAUNA-
14 said she did not know but that she thought so. She said she knew
AMFKE-2 to be a personal friend of AMFAUNA-1, and thought that he might

AMFUKA-14 concluded that they had not observed this meeting, and that
therefore it had been AMFKE-3 who had been under surveillance on 7

and AMFAUNA-1.)
33. ABAD again changed the subject suddenly. "Where is the radio?
he asked. "Could AMFKE-2," have it?" AMFAUNA-14 said she did not know
that he said he had been under surveillance on 7 September. "Where is the camera-14
admitted having seen AMFAUNA-1 with a Minox camera, but said she did not
know what AMFAUNA-1 had done with it. She said she had hoped that
AMFAUNA-1 would leave it with her, and pretended to be hurt that he had
not done so. ABAD asked her whether she had ever seen one like it in
the ACCOA house, and AMFAUNA-14 said that she had. Throughout the
interrogation, ABAD kept reverting to the subject of the camera and the
radio.
34. ABAD asked AMFAUNA-14 what her connection was with the AMICO
family. She replied that her grandmother was the cousin of AMCOG-3's
mother. ABAD said that the whole family had been under observation for

AMFUKA-14, which announced an organization (name not remained

wanted to know, was AMCOG-3 doing. AMFAUNA-14 said that she did not
think he was doing anything clandestine. ABAD replied that the DSE was
positive that AMCOG-3 was doing secret work. AMFAUNA-14 said that the
DSE should not delude itself, that the entire family was too selfish to
engage in anything of the kind.
35. ABAD asked what the diplomatic visitors to the AMCOG household
talk about. AMFAUNA-14 said that they never talk politics. ABAD asked
about the attitude of "the Doctor" (AMCOG-3's uncle), and AMFAUNA-14 said
that he was waiting for the situation to settle.
36. "That about AMFAUNA-37" asked ABAD. "Did she work with
AMFAUNA-17" AMFAUNA-14 said that she did not, but that she sometimes
gave him information. ABAD wanted to know whether AMFAUNA-3 bad been
working with some oneth Florida. AMFAUNA-14 answered that AMFAUNA-3

had been involved somehow with her sister who lives in Florida. ABAD
asked whether AMFAUNA-14 had been a good friend of AMFAUNA-3, and she
said that she had been. ABAD asked whether AMFAUNA-14 had ever heard
AMFAUNA-3 speak about the Escambray insurgents. AMFAUNA-14 said that
she had not. ABAD asked whether AMFAUNA-3 had had contacts with any
embassy people, for example the Spanish Embasys. AMFAUNA-14 said that
she did not know of any such contacts.
37. "How abcut AMCUTLER-27" asked ABAD. "We know that she spends
a lot of time there." AMFAUNA-14 said she did not know.
38. ABAD asked AMFAUNA-14 if she were a revolutionary. AMFAUNA-14
said that she was not, but that neither was the against the revolution,
She said that she had joined the militia early in the revolution; but
had soon dropped out because there were some things about the revolution
which she did not understand. For instance, she could not understand
why there should be so many shortages and rationing, whereas before the
revolution there had been plenty. ABAD explained that the shortages were
the result of the imperialist blockade of Cuba. AMFAUNA-14 said that
she could understand this, but that it did not explain why there should
be a shortage of coffee when Cuba had been the most important.
39. "How about the first two was sending coffee to the Soviet Union
in gratitude for Soviet assistance in overcoming shortages caused by the
imperialist blockade. AMFAUNA-14 replied that this was very logical
now that it had been explained to her, and said she wondered why the
revolutionary government did not publicly say so in order to put an end
to public grumbling on the subject.
39. Early in the morning of 9 October, ABAD produced the letter
which AMFAUNA-14 received from AMFAUNA-1 on 7 October and held up the
letter to the light, examining it carefully for traces of SW. AMFAUNA-
14's developer pills were brought, and she was told to Davaing the latter
which she did in the presence of ABAD, and she was not going to whom
the
society was not going to be. All were very surprised and
disappointed when no secret writing appeared. They kept asking her if
she were sure she was doing it right, and began intimating that she was
deceiving them. (Station Comment: It is indeed surprising that no
secret writing appeared, because this letter was almost undoubtedly the
one containing SW message no. 1 to AMFAUNA-14.)
40. AMFAUNA-14 also explained the use of her carbons. The only
accommodation address she gave away was AMFAUNA-1's JMWAVE area post
office box. She deliberately protected the Rosa JUSTIZ address (the
home of AMPAN-2), not knowing whether this was a real or a fictitious
person.

41. "Carlos" and ABAD now invited AMFAUNA-14 to work with them. She
replied that she might be willing to do so, but first wanted to know
what work would be expected of her. For instance, she said, she would
not inform on people in her office. They told her that this would not
be asked of her, because that sort of work is done by the Defense
Committees. Her work, they said, would be much more important, namely
maintaining a link between themselves and KUBARK. She said that would
be asked of her. She said that she was not going to have
KUBARK would probably put her on ice at seconds they wanted that she
had been arrested. They told her not to worry about them.
42. "Carlos" and ABAD suggested to her that AMPANA-1 had briefed
her to agree to cooperate with them. She denied this, claiming that she
had not really wanted to work with AMFAUNA-1 at all, but had merely let
herself be imposed on for old times sake. They asked whether they
could trust her. She said she thought so, and asked whether she could
trust thes to keep their promises. They assured her that she could,
and said she would be released the following day.
43. In the morning of 10 October, after being told that she was to
be released, AMFAUNA-14 was moved to a smaller cell without a bath. She
V
sent for ABAD and complained that he-had double-crossed her. He told

her that he was going to keep his word and release her, but that her
original cell was needed for some new prisoners who were expected. He
said that the DSE had received advance word that a boatload of refugees
were going to try to leave Cuba that night. Many of them were women,
and one of these was pregnant, so he wanted the larger cell with bath
for them.
44. ABAD always trented AMFAUNA-14 kindly and considerately.
When she had a headache, he ordered aspirin for her. He saw to it that
she received soft drinks when she wanted them, and he seemed to be
honestly distressed whenever she wert. AMTAUNA-14 believes that it had
been the DSE's intention from the very beginning to recruit her, be-
cause she doubts that all DSE prisoners are treated as well.
45. The first SW message which AMFAUNA-14 wrote while under DSE
control was dated 10 October, the day of her release. The DSE officers
asked her what her control signal was, and she replied that it was a
rubric, but also included her true control signal. She deliberately
numbered her first controlled SW message no. 2, to conceal the fact
that she had already written several messages containing intelligence
reports.
46. In all she wrote three SW messages under control. She was
obliged to write each one in duplicate, one of which was mailed and the
other given to the DSE for study. One day "Carlos" came to her very
angrily, said he doubted that her carbons were anything more than
ordinary paper because he had been unable to develop anything that she
had written, and threctored her with recract. AMTAUNA-14 told him
that she did not know anything about it, but that if by chance he had
tried to develop the letters she had written with the pills he had
been given to the DSE for the first time. He was a member of the
AMFAUNA-14 explained that there were two different SW systems, one for
outgoing mail and the other for incoming. "Carlos" then asked her if
there were any significance to the size of envelope used, or to the way.
the letter paper was folded. AMFAUNA-14 said she did not think so.
AMFAUNA-14 feels that "Carlos" and ABAD never completely believed that
she had an SW system, because none of the letters which she received
disclosed SW when developed, and none of the letters which she wrote
showed any traces of SW when held up to glancing light.
47. "Carlos" was the DSE officer who maintained the contact with
AMFAUNA-14 after her release. For the first time she saw her every
month, he was asked for the person for only twenty minutes, and sometimes
saying for several hours, frequently late at night. Occasionally he
called her at her office. Finally AMFAUNA-14 told him that she had to
get up early in the morning to go to work, and asked him to visit her
early in the evening, which he agreed to do. At the time of the in-
tercepted AMGLOSBY landing in Pinar del Rio, "Carlos" did not visit
AMFAUNA-14 for five days. When he finally returned, he was dirty,
sweaty and tired. He dictated an SW letter he wanted AMFAUNA-14 to
send to EURBAK, and while she was writing it he fell asleep.
48. AMFAUNA-14 had to prepare written reports for him, which she
signed with the pseudonym "Dolores." He told her never to call him at
DSE headquarters, because he was never there. Once he brought her a
book on Marxism to read, and promised to take her someday to visit a
collective farm in Pinar del Rio Province.
49. Despite his occasional efforts to get her to pick up the threads
of the AMFAUNA net, AMFAUNA-14 believes that the primary target she was
referred to by the DSE. He said, "The DSE was a new from remarks made by
both ABAD and "Carlos", she deduced that they already had an informer
in the house, but that they were not satisfied with his production.
Toward the end of her period of DSE -controlled activity, she felt that
the DSE was becoming relatively less interested in AMFAUNA-1 and his
net, and more in the AMCOG household.
50. They asked her about one Vicente LAGO, who is a regular guest
at the AMCOG house and who seems to be particularly interesting to them.

(b) AMCUTLER-2 had received a letter from AMFAUNA-1 dated 18
October saying that she would receive a visit from a person known to her
who would introduce himself as "Edgardo", and asking her to introduce
"Egdardo" to AMFAUNA-14. This person has not yet arrived, and AMCUTLER-
2 does not know who he is.
67. AMCUTLER-2 agreed to stick to these stories in case she is
interrogated, and to brief "Ketti" to support the coffee shop story.
She also told AMFAUNA-14 she had decided to go into hiding immediately.
AMFAUNA-14 asked her not to do it so soon after her visit, but AMCUTLER-
2 said that AMFAUNA-14 should provide her with cover by telling the DSE
that AMCUTLER-2 had spoken of taking a holiday at Varadero.
68. Making her report to "Carlos" after this meeting, AMFAUNA-14
told these cover stories as though they had just been revealed to her
by AMCUTLER-2.
69. A fourth letter arrived from AMFAUNA-1, consisting of two
pages of overt text. AMFAUNA-14 was sure that it contained SW because
of the banalities in the cover letter. Be2ore turning it over to
"Carlos" she took it to AMCOG-3 who had snwebody make a literal copy
of it and then destroyed the original. AMFAUNA-14 turned the copy over
to "Carlos" who had her develop it, and was again disappointed and angry
when no SW showed up. (Station comment: this letter had contained SW
number groups for OWVL reception.)
70. On or about 10 November 1963, AMFAUNA-14 prepared a written
report for the DSE on the visitors to the AMCOG household. This report
was actually dictated by AMCOG-3 to AMFAUNA-14 who took it down on the
typewriter. She then made a handwritten copy of the report to turn in
to the DSE, keeping the typewriter copy for self-briefing. She brought
the typerrition copy out with her. Following is a literal translation:
a. ( Dr) arsensto (MARTI and his wire Lolita: I do not know them
very well. All I can say about them is what I have heard, that they
are old friends of the family, and that the doctor took a trip to Mexico
with AMCOG-3's uncle after the latter's election.
b. Sr. Pedro CARRILLO and his wife Margot: He is a brother of
Justo *CARRILLO and his been a friend of the family for a long time.
They sympathize with the Revolution in some aspects, but their daughter
(who I think is engaged to the son of AMCOG-2) left Cuba for exile, and
this caused them to change. I do not know why their daughter had to
take asylum.
c. Dr. Oscar *PINA and his wife Margarita: Within the family
she has the nickname "Petite." He is a judge. Until very recently he
was neutral, but now it seems that they have loaded him with work and
he is in a very bad mood because I believe he has the work of eight
cases. She does not sympathize much with the Revolution. They have no
children, but almost all of her family is abroad which I think is her
principal reason for being discontented.
c. Dr. Oscar *PINA and his wife Margarita: Within the family
the former Chief of Police Of Havana. She has a daughter by him whom
she brings to lunch every Sunday, and she is also caring for a son of
CARAMES who is a member of thebelow asylum. I do not believe that at the
moment she is on good terms with her husband who is abroad, and there-
fore she is neither against nor in favor. Actually I believe she is
tradified that the situation will be the same and her husband will return.
e. Sr. Fernando / *STEFFANI: An elderly gentleman who is the
father of an intimate friend of AMCOG-2, who out of pity has given him
a; standing invitation for every Sunday. To be sure, the poor fellow
is rather tiresome.

f.
Eisa /PIAZ Biant: Her family has been friendly with the
AMCOO family Tor many years. They were school friends. She has a
sister abroad and a brother who is in primn. Her father and mother
seldom come to the house. A sister of her is a doctor of some farm.
All she does is obtain medicines for the prisoners, thereby causing
a lot of trouble for AMCOO-2, AMCOG-3 and the old man.
g. Joaquin SACHENEZ and his wife Sara: According to what I
have heard, he is a travelling salesman for some laboratory. > His wife
is the sister of the wife of the old man's two nephews, Pancho and
AMCOG-3 (sic). I have also heard that she is always trying to get
medicine for her son who, from what I have heard, is abnormal.
h. Dr. Maria Dolores BARCHENEZ Pessino: She lost both her
father and mcher when she was thirteen years old, and the AMCOG family
took her in as an adopted daughter. She was a father of her education.
She is like a daughter to him, and like a sister to the nephew and niece.
She works in the emergency hospital. She is not openly opposed to the
regime, but nevertheless the separation from her brother and her relatives
has greatly affected her.
i. Dr. Vicente FLACO and his wife Maria Julia: His brother
Roberto LAGO; who died some years ago, was Pola's first husband. They
have two sons abroad. From what I have heard, he devotes himself ex-
clusively to his profession, and it is she who is most upset by the
separation from her children.
1.
J. Mercedes VALDES Chacon: A case very similar to that of
STEPFAN, except that she is a woman who is a very good friend of
AMCOG-2's husband, and fe in the same situation with her relatives
abroad. She is just one more of the many refugees in search of warmth
and friendship, with no friends left in Cuba.
m2
k. Julio /BRAVO: A long-time friend of Pancho, all his family
is abroad. He is another case of warmth and friendship, he uses the
swimming pool a lot, he is alone, I have even seen him cutting trees
with AMCOG-3, a typical case of an unhappy man, in the afternoons he
plays chess with the old man, and I have never heard him say anything
bad about anybody, not even about the situation, the only thing - as is
natural - he misses his daughters and his wife. 11
1. Raquel CASAGRAN: The widow of the Director of Culture in
the Grau Government, Jesus CASAGRAN, and sister of Raul LAZARO who was
military aide to both Grau and Prio. She is very highly regarded by
the family. I have never heard her express herself in any way against
the Government; I would call her neutral.
21
n. Olga /CRESCENTE: Former wife of Jose Maria de la Águilera
she comes to the house with her two daughters and hermother who is a
cousin of Sra. Paulina. AMCOG-2 helped her a lot in hiding her husband
during the Batista tyranny. I have also heard that AMCOG-3 helped her
with her divorce. Apparently she does not sympathize with the Revolution,
although I believe that it is out of spite against her husband. Her
mother's name is Leopoldina SACHENEZ Vda. de Creccite, and her id岭ckname
d's

All she does is obtain medicines for the prisoners, thereby causing
a lot of trouble for AMCOO-2, AMCOO-3 and the old man

g. Joaquin
BANCHEZ and his wife Sara: According to what I
have heard, he Is a travelling a&leseman for some laboratory, His wife
is the sister of the wife of the old man's two nephews, Pancho and
AMCOO-3 (sic). I have also heard that she is always trying to get
medicine for her son who, from what I have heard, is abnormal.
h. Dr. Maria Dolores BANCHEZ Pecino: She lost both her
father and mother when she was thirteen years old, and the AMCOG family
took her in as an adopted daughter. The old man paid for her education.
She is like a daughter to him, and I tke a sister to the nephew and niece.
She works in the emergency hospital. She is not openly opposed to the
regime, but nevertheless the separation from her brother and her relatives
has greatly affected her.

i. (Dry Vicente LAGO and his wife Maria Julia: His brother
Roberto LAGO, who died some years ago, was Pola's first husband. They
have two sons abroad. From what I have heard, he devotes himself ex-
clusively to his profession, and it is she who is most upset by the
separation from her children.
j. Mercedes
EVALDES
Chacon: A case very similar to that of
STEFFANI, except that she is a woman who is a very good friend of
AMCOO-2's husband, and is in the same situation with her relatives
abroad. She is just one more of the many refugees in search of warmth
and friendship, with no friends left in Cuba.
11
k. Julio BRAVO: A long-time friend of Pancho, all his family
is abroad. He is another case of warmth and friendship, he uses the
swimming pool a lot, he is alone, I have even seen him cutting trees
with AMCOO-3, a typical case of an unhappy man, in the afternoons he
plays chess with the old man, and I have never heard him say anything
bad about anybody, not even about the situation, the only thing - as 18
natural - he misses his daughters and his wife
1. Raquel
CASA GRAN: The widow of the Director of Culture in
the Grau Government. Jesus CASAGRAN, and sister of Raul LAZARO who was
military aide to both Grau and Prio. She is very highly regarded by
the family. I have never heard her express herself in any way against
the Government; I would call her neutral.
11
m. Olga/RECENTE: Former wife of Jose Maria de la Aguilera,
she comes to the hndue with her two daughters and hermother who is a
cousin of Sra. Paulina. AMCOG-2 helped her a lot hiding her husband
during the Batista tyranny. I have also heard that AMCOG-3 helped her
with her divorce. Apparently she does not sympathize with the Revolution,
although I believe that it is out of spite against her husband. Her
mother's name is Leopoldina SANCHEZ Vda. de Creente, and her nicking

UFGA-12894
before she married J. AGUERO. Politically speaking, she follows the
Grau line. She is more or less neutral, and devotes herself to her
teaching work. He devotes himself exclusively to his work.
p. Manuel *COMPANIONI and his wife Alicia: They have been
acquaintances of AMCOG-2 and AMCOG-3 for many years, although it was not
a close friendship, rather a friendship of Montmartre, Tropicana, etc.
A daughter of theirs is abroad. He too was a very good friend of Armandt
FEO who used to be a friend of the family, and now in the course of time
they have become closer friends of the family. In other words it is
a
very good friend of the family, and how much more than the family has
a small
deodorant factory in the same house where they live. They both
have their mothers here.
q. Jack/ *CONNILL and his wife Marina: His mother has been a
very good friend of the family for many years, and she was a school
friend of the two nieces of the old man. This couple have always been
friends of the family, the more so now that so many of their friends
have left Cuba.
71. AMFAUNA-14 turned this report over to "Carlos" on 11 or 12
November. At this meeting he asked her to try to make contact with
AMFAUNA-3's brother who he said had been transferred to a hospital in
Las Villas. AMFAUNA-14 said she would try, but thought it would be
difficult. This was the last time she saw "Carlos." He telephoned her
again on 16 November to ask what was new, and this was their last
telephone contact.
72. When AMFAUNA-14 arrived at AMCOG-3's house at about 2000 hours
on 15 November 1963 for the regular Friday night supper, he took her
aside and said he wanted to speak to her privately later. At about
2330 hours she went to his room. There he told her that he had received
orders that she was to leave Cuba the following week. He said that
precise instructions were to come on 16 and 17 November, so he made a
lunch date with her for Sunday noon at his house.
73. AMFAUNA-14 was frightened by this. She did not sleep well
Friday or Saturday nights, and spent Saturday in her home.
74. Sunday afternoon in AMCOG-3's house, AMCOG-3 told her that she
was to leave the following day. She said that she did not want to.
AMCOG-3 responded that this was an order. He said that the DSE would
probably arrest her again soon, and for her own safety and that of others
she must leave. He added that there were others who were to leave too,
whose departure had been made conditional upon her own.
75. AMFAUNA-14 asked whether AMCUTLER-2 were one of these other
people who were to leave too, and AMCOG-3 replied that she was. AMFAUNA-
14 told him that she thought AMCUTLER-2 would not agree to leave. AMCOG-3
said that he thought she would because the orders had been couched in
very strong terms.
76. He then showed her the instructions, both for herself and for
AMCUTLER-2. He had her type her instructions on a piece of paper, and
then memorize them.
77. Then AMCOG-3 gave AMFAUNA-14 the following verbal messages to
deliver when she reached JMWAVE:
(a) A colonel fn LANDETRA, a tank expert who had been in the
Cuban Army under GRAU and PRIO, is a prisoner on a farm in Havana Pro
vince. He is given three days off per week to go home. His wife knows
in advance when he will be coming out. AMCOG-3 does not know the wife;
but has indirect contact to her. AMCOG-3 says the man is honest and
intelligent and a real soldier, and if we want him out AMCOG-3 can
arrange it.
(b) As of about 1800 hours on 17 November, a young man who had
infiltrated into Cuba and had been hiding at the home of Israel [ADAILA]

had been moved to a new hiding place. AMCOG-3 was considering trying
to help the young man into asylum in the Uruguayan Embassy through a
certain "Pepin" whose identity is not known to AMFAUNA-14 but who she
thinks is an Uruguayan atchache.
06
(c) AMCOG-3 is out of one-time pads and needs a resupply.
(d) It is very possible that AMCUO-3 may be able to obtain
and forward a copy of AMFAUNA-14 DSE dossier.
78. On Monday morning, 18 November, AMPAUNA-14 dressed as she had
been instructed, and stuffed a pair of slacks and sneakers into the
straw handbag which she had been told to carry. At 1300 hours she left
her office and proceeded on foot to the corner of Atares and Arango in
Reparto Luyano, arriving there at 1400 hours. Here she exceeded her
instructions, waiting for AMCUTLER-2 not five minutes but fifteen. She
then walked very slowly toward Calzada Luyano, hoping that AMCUTLER-2
might overtake her. This consumed another ten minutes, and by the time
she reached the Calzada Luyano it was too late for her to walk the re-
mainder of the distance, so she took a taxi.
79. AMPAUNA-14 discharged the taxi one block before theParque de
la Virgen del Camino and walked the rest of the way. She went to the
shrine where she prayed for a few minutes, and then sat on a bench
from which she could see the whole park.
80. At 1510 hours a 1954 Buick taxi arrived at the park. The
driver stayed in the car, and two men - a colored man and a fair-haired
man - got out and walked around for about ten minutes. Finally they
approached her and gave the challenge, to which she gave the correct
response. One of the men then said simply "Follow me". They took her
back to the taxi and put her in the back seat with one of the men, the
other two riding in front.
81. They headed out of the city. When the reached the Carretera
de Varadero, one of the men asked her politely if she would mind keeping
her eyes directed down toward the floor and not look out the window.
She rode this way for about two hours. By then it was dark, and she was
told she could look up again. She took advantage of the opportunity to
change into her slacks and sneakers.
82. Finally the car stopped, and she and her two escorts got out.
They walked a long time. At one point, whistle signals were exchanged
with someone in the darkness, and two other men appeared, one of whom
was AM@C:2, AMPAUNA-14 and AM@CE)2 greeted each other politely, but
pretendedhot to know each other. 3
83. They did a lot more walking and joined up with another man, who
turned out to be the radio man. He had a lot of equipment with him,
and AMFAUNA-14 and AM@CE)2 helped to carry it.
84. They now reached the mangrove and began to walk through water.
At one point their guide became briefly lost, but found his way again
almost immediately. When they came to the open water, one of the guides
went forvard and signalled. The boat came in in response to the signal.
AMPAUNA-14, (AM@CE)2, and the radio man walked out into knee-deep water
and climbed into the boat, which already had a crew of two.
85. The boat proceeded out to an unidentified key. The crew con-
cealed it in the mangrove, cleverly lacing and tying branches together
over it to form a camouflage cover. There they went to sleep.
86. The following day, 19 November, was spent at this spot. A
radio message was received during the day. At night the boat put out
for Cayo Hegano. The waves were enormous, and AMFAUNA-14 was terribly
seasick. The boat remained at the rendezvous point until 1045 hours,
with AMFAUNA-14 pleading for the crew to return to land, saying she
would rather be shot than remain so seasick. Finally the crew did put
back, saying that the ship probably would not come because the sea was

87. Wednesday, 20 November, was spent on the same key. A very
20
long radio message was received during the day. AMFAUNA-14 and AMFER

both helped the radio man to decipher it, and their combined efforts
took about three hours. Then they put out again for the Cayo Megano
rendezvous point. By this time their drinking water was all gone,
The boat was overloaded, so much of the food and equipment was left
behind on the key. Again no ship appeared. This time, instead of
returning to their original hiding place, the crew took the boat to
Cayo Mosquito.
88. Here they spent the remainder of the night, and all cf Thursday
21 November. Their water was gone, there was very little food left,
and there was only enough gasoline left for one more one-way trip
out to the rendezvous point. At 1400 hours on 21 November another
radio message was received, it the combined efforts of the radio
man, AMFAUNA-14 and AMFER, which between two and three hours to
decipher it. The boat was conveyed to optimistic; they were all sure that
they would be picked up today. And they put that night.
89. Promptly at 2300 hours the ship was seen approaching. The
boat put out immediately, and it passengers were taken aboard the ship
AMFAUNA-14 was taken into the sick bay where she was given a pill, a
little water, and somewhat later some warm broth.
90. From the moment she stepped into the boat on 18 November, until
she was hauled out by the armpits on 21 November, AMFAUNA-14 never left
the boat. Her side and legs were bruised from the pounding of the
waves; against the boat. A little blood vessel in her right eye was
broken by having a small boat, and the boat liked through the man-
groove. The ship was trapped by the ship's doctor.
91. AMFAUNA-14 says that the AMHICK team performed very well. The
pickup in the park was done excellently. The slight delay while they
looked her over, she says, was due to the fact that the men had ex-
pected another woman to be with her, and they were waiting a few minutes
in case the other woman should show up. The AMHICK team said that they
had also been briefed that she would be wearing her hair in a bun.
She had not been briefed accordingly, and she was wearing her hair
down her back in a pony tail. This discrepancy did not cause any con-
fusion, because every other item of the visual recognition signals
tallied perfectly, and the AMHICK team were well briefed on all of them
92. AMFAUNA-14 was impressed by the precise timing of the team's
movements, by the fact that everybody was where he was supposed to be
at the time indicated. She expressed admiration for their seamanship,
and their ability to pick out one spot of mangrove from another in
the pitch darkness.
93. She says that, during these trying days, the team members were
always in calm control of the situation, and never failing in their
courtesy to her.
94. Regarding AMCTULER-2, AMFAUNA-14 is sure that the exfiltration
instructions reached her. They were taken, she said, by Lolita PORMOSO
who had been standing by for them from Friday to Sunday. What Lolita
did with them, AMFAUNA-14 does not know. She knows that he had
suggested that Lolita take them to AMFAUNA-1's mother, but she also
knows that we had indicated to AMCOG-3 that AMFAUNA-1's mother might
be able to have a little chance of thinking. Kolita might have taken them
directly to AMCUTLER-2. In any case, she knows that messages sent
proviously by AMCOG-3 to AMCUTLER-2, she later, and she sees
no reason to assume that these instructions did not.
95. It does not surprise AMFAUNA-14 that AMCUTLER-2 did not follow
the orders. AMCUTLER-2, she says, plays her own game with little con-
sideration for others. Between the time that AMFAUNA-1 left Cuba on
11 September, and the time that AMFAUNA-14 was arrested on 7 October,
AMCUTLER-2 had visited AMFAUNA-14's apartment twice. On both occasions,

AMFAUNA-14 had asked her to remove the suitcase that AMPAUNA-1 had left
behind, but on both occasions AMCUTLER-2 had found some excuse not to
do so. When AMPAUNA-14 visited AMCUTLER-2 in her home in Guanabacoa
on 3 November for the purpose of coordinating their cover stories,
the 1980s and 1981, had been the most important source of the
anything - and AMPAUNA-14 believes that AMCUTLER-2 may be working for
the Second Front of the Escambray, because her
very close friend Lolin 14 CORREOSO is the finance of-Hipolito MARRAURI
who was a collector for this organization. Among other reaspons

possibly keeping AMCUTLER-2 in Cuba, AMPAUNA-14 says that AMCUTLER-2
s
mother is sick with cancer, and there may t. something wrong between
AMCUTLER-1 and AMCUTLER-2.
96. AMPAUNA-14 also had her reasons for not wanting to leave Cuba.
Besides the dangers of the trip, she would he leaving her mother and
father in a dangerous position, because the DSE had forced her to
sign a confession implicating them. While she appears to be trying not
to be overly critical of AMCUTLER-2, she has commented that AMCUTLER-2
knows far more members of the AMPAUNA net than she herself does, so
that the reasons requiring the exfiltration of AMPAUNA-14 should be
even more compelling for AMCUTLER-2.
