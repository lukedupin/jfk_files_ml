2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
28 February 1961
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
FROM : Chief, SB/2 Desk
24
SUBJECT: COVER, NONOFFICIAL) - GENERAL
(Proposal for A&E Assessment of Potential
REESKIN Agent Candidates)
#90682
1. Reference is made to my previous memorandum pertaining
to the subject as captioned, ending with the Memorandum for the
Record dated 21 February 1961.
2. As indicated in the referenced memorandum, CCC feels
that the (STOHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT ASSOCIATES) (see copy of SR
memorandum - dated 3 February 1961 and my memorandum dated 21
February 1961) should not be utilized. This decision was made
as a result of a conversation between Mr. Howard OSBORNE,
Deputy Chief, SR Division, and Mr. Jack SOUTHERD, Chief, CCC/NC.
3. A meeting was called on 27 February 1961 to determine
the type of cover organization that should be substituted for
this purpose. After considering the matter atlength, it was
ascertained that the Agency has a cleared (empldment) service in
( Pittsburgh) which could possibly be utilized as an initial
A&E assessment. This firm, the EMPLOYMENT SERVICE COMPANY
is
is located in the Union Trust Building, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 10
and is managed by (Margaret A. KEARNEY) (see SSD File 9501D).

It was agreed that if the EMPLOYERS SERVICE COMPANY) could
provide the needed cover, two OTR psychologists Would be docu-
mented in true name with that firm in (Pittsburgh) (CC (Frank
S
D
O'MALIFY) will make a trip to Pittsburg) in the next few days
to determine whether Miss (KEARNET) is amenable to the proposed
arrangement. The two psychologists selected were Doctors
BRADT and McKEF Jon whom credit checks were recently completed
with negative results as to Agency employment.
4. It was further ascertained at this time that Mr.
Howard OSBORNE desired that all training and assessment of
REDSKIN Agents who pass the initial screening be conducted

outside the Washington, D. C. area. Host of the training will
be conducted in an SR safe house in New York. The SR represen-
tative will probably request a safe house in Baltimore for the
final assessment and processing of those REDSKIN Agents that
are cleared in the initial screening by either BRAUT or (McKEE) 06
It should be noted at this point that SR Division plans to
process thirty or thirty-five REDSKIN Agents this year. Time
is, of course, of the essence, in view of the fact that these
people will have to be assessed, security-cleared, briefed,
and trained, and arrangements for grants made before the summer
season.
