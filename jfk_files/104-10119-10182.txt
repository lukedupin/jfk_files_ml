:
Comments on Manuscript Give Us This Day;
CIA and the Bay of Pigs Invasion by Edward J.
Hamilton
1. This manuscript has evidently been kicking around in publishing
circles since at least mid-1968, presumably without CIA clearance.
William Buckley of the National Review seems to have been "shopping" it
at one point. One publisher rejected it as too "controversial", and noted
its "confidential" nature as well as its potential for libel suits.
2. In the foreword to this manuscript, the author (whom I shall
refer to under his assumed name of Hamilton), describes the book as a
"personal account" of CIA's role in the Bay of Pigs affair in which he was
a
senior CIA participant for 19 months. He notes in the foreword his hope
that someone would have written this book so that he would not have to do
it; now convinced that, if he does not write it, it will never be written,
he has taken up his pen "reluctantly and in a mood of nostalgic bitterness."
Hamilton states that he has used no official files or documents and has
consulted no one in preparing this work. Where true names are used in
the manuscript for CIA personnel, he writes that they have been publicly
identified before, and in this contention I believe that he is correct, with
the possible exception of Jim Noel The author's claim that this book
would provide no information not known to Castro's intelligence service,
or that details this late are of no value to the opposition, is, in my view,
seriously open to question.
3. The book is, in general,favorable to CIA actions in the Bay of
the. The villains of the piece are certain liberal figures in the Kennedy
ministration (Schlesinger, Goodwin, Stevenson) and to some extent,
the President himself. In his concluding chapter, the author's bitterness
is undisguised against those in the Administration and the press who took
the opportunity of the Bay of Pigs incident to attack and denigrate CIA.
4. Messrs. Bissell and Barnes and the author's other CIA co-
workers in the Cuban Project, by and large, are given quite favorable
treatment. One exception is General Cabell, whom the author excoriates,
and it is apparent that Hamilton's opinion of Jerry Droller is far from

favorable, both on political and professional grounds. "Jim Noel also
remes est peorly.
5. It is apparent that Hamilton feels very deeply about the Bay of
Pigs and its aftermath, to the extent that he is willing to put his career
on the line by circulating this manuscript to several palishers without
apparent clearance or authorisation. He has utilised as his mom do plame
the special name assigned to him in the project for dealing with the Cuban
Prune, and it vould not take anyone who was involved in the Cuban Project
more than a few pages of reading to identify the author, as one potential
published pointed out. The manuscript itself is the most comprehensive
story of a CIA operation that has over been written for publications
knowledge. Meetings, conversations, and internal detail have seternal
actions are here reported extensively and with all the authority of an
"Insider" who was there. It far exceeds in detail anything that has been
written on the Bay of Pigs, including Charles Masply's article in Fortune
of September 1961 or the "insider" books that were published following the
death of President Kennedy.
6. Attached herewith is a chapter-by-chapter description of the
manuscript particulariy as it affects CIA security. This analysis states
what the author states, whether right or wrong. Where I have occasion-
ally added comments of my own, they are in brackets [].

Chapter I
1. The chapter opens in 1956 in Ambassador Gardemer's office in Havens,
where a courtesy call was being paid on the Ambassador by the CIA Central
American and Caribbean. Chieis of Station who are holding their annual regional
meeting. is noted that one of the reasons for selecting the place of meeting
was the "absence of Communist embassies" (p. 6). The presence of Col. 1.0
King Division Chief, is mentioned. Col. King remarks that Castro was
sively involved in the Bogatso, setting the stage for Hamilton's subso-
gest comment. Actually Castro played a junior role in the Bogotase, and
it was after the Bay of Pigs that Mr. Dulles assigned Hamilton the talk of
determining Castro's role in the Bogotase, (p. 7). Hamilton states that in
the subsequent three years, while funda were being collected in South America
for Castro's 2th of July Movement, there were no orders from CIA Head-
quarters to penetrate pre-Castro groups abroad (p. 10). He then states that
in March 1966 he was "having coffees with the newly-elected president of the
country to which I was assigned. (p.10) This could reveal the author's
relationship with President Nardone of Uruguay who became President in
easily March 1966.]
2. Mr. Richard Bissell and Mr. Tracy Barnes are mentioned and
the author adds that he had worked with Barnes as a member of the team
that ousted President Arbens from Guatemala (p.11). At this point Hamilton
recalled to Headquarters to become Chief of Political Action in an
Heachower-approved project to assist Caban eriles in overthrowing Castro.
his duties would include organizing Cuban leaders into a goverament-in-
exile which would form a provisional goverament in Cuba when Castro was
forced out. Hamilton's base was to be in Costa Rica, provided ex-President
Pepe Figures could obtain Costa Rican agreement (p.11). [This link could
be quite embarrassing in view of Figuere's recent re-election as President
of Costa Rica.]
3. At this point the manuscript introduces the Project Chief as Jake
presumably Mr. Esterline], who is referred to as Jake throughout (p. 12).
We also meet Droller about whom there is some "diversity in attitudes"
among CIA officers. Droller's operational name of Frank Bender is noted(p.13),
and he is referred to as Bender throughout the rest of the manuscript. [This
is not the first time Droller has been identified as Bender; his name was
blown by Arthur Schlesinger in his book A Thousand Days in 1965.ã€‘ Bender's
cover telephone arrangements in Miami and New York, which allowed him to
answer local calls there at his Washington desk, are disclosed (p.14).
Hamilton states that Bender told him that as far as he knew "Richard Helms,
Chief of Operations for the Clandestine Services, had not been cut in" (p.14).

4. Hamilton calls on the Project's Preparanda Chid
Pase Thillip). viem to calls Knight throubet. noting that Knight had worked
for him on the Gastemelle project. He notes that Kight had open most of his
ca arcer on the outside, 1.e., under cover", and that he had spent the three
preceding yeas under cover is Havana. At this point Kight was close estab
bithing a clendation zadio on Sven Island (p. 15). The Paramilitary Chid is
also introduced and is elated Ned throughout. (p. 15). Ned tells Hamilton that
Cohn refuges are being recruited and polygraphed at Uespe Island off Fort
Myer, Tiersla (p.16). Hamilton is also advised of the role of Reberto Alajos
and of the Rethalache base in Guatemala that all this had the censent of
Gustemelle President Ydigeras. (p.16) his all been preperimally

Chapter II
1. In this chapter Hamilton states that Bernes and others recommended
that he visit Havana, and that the CIA Cover Staff provided him with the docu-
mentation for his operational alics of Edward J. Hamilton which he kept for
the duration of the Project (p. 23). Upon returning from Havana, Hamilton
prepared a report and recommendations. The first recommendations was that
Citro be assassinated before or endciated with the invasion. Hamilton con-
aldered this his principal recommendation, but Barass would only tell him
subsequently that it was in the hands of a "special group." So for an Hamilton
was able to detormits, no plan was ever developed within CIA to assassinate
Battman (pp. 30-31) [These comments could be undertaken if published, in
view of current charges in the press of various CIA "assassination
2. Hamilton describes a lincheon that he and Jake had with Brig.
General Robert Cushman, then Assistant for National Security Affairs to
Vice President Nixon. Hamilton had known Cushman when the latter had had
Bartmier tour in CIA, and Jake said that Cushman followed the Cuban Pro-
ject for the Vice President. Hamilton states that Cushman advised him that
Nicon "as Chairman [sic] of the National Security Council, was the real
spark plug behind the project" and the Administration's focal point and trouble-
shooter regarding it. The General gave Hamilton his private telephone
number in the event that he had something for the Vice President's urgent
attention (pp. 31A-32).

Chapter III (commencing at page 34)
1. As in Chapter II, here again Hamilton's distaste for Bender comes
through The difference is particularly one of their political philosophies
Hamilion being quite conservative and Bender being a liberal, is: Hamilton
was pro-Minn, Bender apparently anti-Mirne. Hamilion gets the impression
(in both Chapters II and III) that conservative Cuber elements, such as the
inferences and professional communities, would not be much utilised in the
Project's plans. In Hamilton's view, the emphasis was on utilising Cabane
who had originally supported Castro but who had fied Cale when they became
aware of the direction in which the Castro Revolution was moving
2. In the chapter, Hamilion discases the salal leaders of the
with whom he was to work and chel# budget (15-39).
3. Hamilione tell. at visiting the Ceban Project headquarters in Coral
Cables, acting the building's discipline as an electronic firm for cover par-
pases (p.39), as well as CIA subsidies to Cuban exile groups and newspapers.
In an intra-office squabble with the paramilitary elements of the Project,
Hamilion loses control of military hardware, a decision he considers basi-
ally wrong in that it placed the paramilitary people in charge of what the
Oathans wanted most and the undercut Hamilion's political action role (pp. 42-45).
The habit of the chapter describes the variope members of the Fronte including
Choir Idiesyncrasies, as well as some account of these wholvould not join.

Chapter V
1. Hamilton writes in this chapter (p.77). and in several subsequent
chapters, of the general failure of infiltration efforts into Cuba, the rall-up
of those that get there, and the poor record for delivering supplies to those
and-Castre gerrillies who might have gotten into Cuba. Maritime operations
also were not very effective.
2. Hamilton underscores the fact that at no meeting of which he was
aware was it asserted that the Cuban underground or population was sched-
aled to play a significant rate in the invasion. He notes the many statements
to the. of the prees and alseveng from undformed
commenters (p. 79). The remainder of the chapter describes Hamilton's
vlees on various members of the France, his observations with them dar-
ing the period between the election of 1968 and President
ration, during which time a lot of the activity greard to halt. Hamilton
here also again alra one of his major, gripes, namely that the Cabin political
objectives vere being continually dewgraded in favor of the paramilitary
operations (pp. 92-99).

Phil" (pp. 94-95)

2. Hamilton describes Jim Noel's arrival at the Miami Base, fol-
lowing the severing of diplomatic relations with Cabe, as "unwelcome",
because he fols him to be "basically either soft on Communism or at least
terribly confused about the issues" (p. 94). Hamilton offers his criticism
of Manuel (Manuel) Ray because the latter had stayed with Castro too long
and was aow sounding a theme of "the revolution betrayed" which was find-
ing favor at the White House, State and CIA.

Chapter VII
1. This chapter relates Hamilton's touchy visit, with some members
of the Fronte, to the Gustemala training bases. Their breakfast conversa-
tions with President Yldgoras are described. This breakfast gives the author
a chance to reflect back on the CIA role in the overthrow of Guatemala
President Arhens. He recalls the three exiled leaders of Guatemala, his
own support for Dr. Cordova to head the new government, and State's vote
of Col. Tidigeras as "vagely authoritarian." At a crucial moment, however.
Dr. Cordova had to undergo cancer surgery and therefore could not be selected
the chodce fell on Castille Armas. New Yldgoras was President but was sub-
sequently overthrown because he had deme so much for the U.S. and
Cuba (pp. 119-122).

2. Bob Davie, the CIA Chief in Guatemala, is mentioned as a partici-
gant in the breakfast with Yldigeras. [Davie' name has been published
previously.)
3. At the Guatemalan training site, Hamilton refers to being greeted
there by an American Army L. Colonel whose name was "Frast." In a
footnote, Hamilton adds that this officer had been detailed to CIA for the
Project, and that "Credible allegations of his actions during the invasion
strangly suggest that he was to some extent mentally unabalanced" (p. 124).
Hostile conversation between Hamilton and "Frank", as well as the initial
unfortunate polemics of Frente chief Tony Varen, are described.
4. The presence of Green Berets to help in the training of the
Brigade is noted. Colonel Laine's presence and parachute training is again
mentioned (pp. 195-136).

Chapter VII
1. This chapter describes more conversations regarding internal pro-
lems within the Frente, one of whose members is trying to bring in
Ray (p. 146-145).
2. Hamilton then telle of a meeting with Biessell who said that he was
under White House pressure to broaden the political base of the Frente.
Evidently former Venesellen President Betancourt, former Costa Rica
President Figuerae and Fesorte Rican Governor Mora's views reisizing
on the inclesion of Manolo Ray (p. 146). Schlesinger and
becking Ray, Hamilton mestioned that the Oubans did not like
of the lateness with which he broke from Cas tro (p. 147). Bissell noted
that the Joint Chiefa of Staff wished to send an evaluation team to the training
camps to appraise the state of readiness (p. 148).
3. Tracy Barnes takes Hamilto to see Schlesinger at the White House
where the latter is working on his famous White Paper on Caha (p. 150, 2
was there that Hamilton learned that Secretary of State Rask had vetoed the
original point of invasion as too "ndey." Ambassador Stevenson jodas the
meeting and asks Dares if everything was going well. Hamilton interprets
this remark as indicating that the Ambassador know about the invasion plans,
which the latter had subsequently denied. Hamilton also mantions the fact
that Barnes had kept a mamernaduse of his briefing of Stevenson before the
invasioa (pp. 152-153).

Chapter IX
1. Hamilton states that the Joint Chiefs of Staff assessment team
visited the Guatemalan camps and issued an enthusiastic appraisal as to
the Brigada's training and battle readiness (p. 160). The author notes
that this was important in the light of post-invasion attempts by the
Pentagon to play down their role.
2. in a footnote, Hamilton writes that after the invasion Bender
Faws yalled" by the fact that the exiles referred to him freely, and usually
in
in
allattering terms (p. 162). Hamilton also adds that he learned that
Sim Nood and will Carr. "Cal. King's cromy". were becoming increasingly
active among non-Frente Cabans in Washington and New York (p. 163)
[This presumably out across Hamlites' political action Mines.]
3. The remainder of the chapter is largely taken up with discussions
of intra-Frents problems, with a note of the fact that American infiltra-
tion operations into Cuba had virtually ceased because of their lack of
success.

Chapter X
1. This chapter opens with an unsuccessfal internal revol! against
President Ydigoras in Guatemala and indicates the desire of the Cuban
Trente and some of the Cuban Brigade in Guatemala to come to his
tance. Hamilton relayed this request to Washington, where it was considered
by Bender, Bernea and Bissall, and presembally higher levels, and turned
down (p. 190). Tidigora mccoded in putting down this revol. Hamilton
notes that he subsequently leasred that several companies of the Brigade
had disbeyed orders, amade a show of before at a rebel stronghold and
helped stifle the uprising (p. 182).
2. In mid-March 1964, Hamditesu and cammoned back to Washington
to a meeting with Bissall, Barres, Joke, Bandar and James Nool) Barres
pointed out that the White House wanted a broader base in the firme, and
how important it was to the White House to bring Menolo Ray into the
Raniltoo pointed out that the Cebans delighted Ray and that a large percentage
of the Cebans accepted the Frento. (Mild) indicated that Ray was not aed
as painted, while Hamilton listed the Cuban objections to Ray's prograne
of Castroism without Fidel and the length of time it took Ray to become
disilisioned with Castro. Furthermore, Ray's program did not ineludic
beturating to the Cuban Constitution of 1940 which the others all sup:
ported (pp. 185-189). As's result of the desire to force Ray into the Frento
Hamilion assigned his position in Miami and was reassigned (p. 189). Jim

Chapter Xi
1. Hamilton moved to Washington to assist Kniigh (presumably Dave
Phillipel) in the propaganda work. An attempt to secaze Mexican coopera-
tion to obtain a re-fealing stop for the Guatemalan-based aircract schedaled
to bomb Coba failed because of the venality of a Mexican air force officer
whose price CIA would not meet. In Hamilton's view, this was an error.
2. As the Frente leaders were clamoring for invasion information,
it was determined to bring them to New York and to tell them if they wanted
to learn the assanit plans and go to the beachhead, they would have to agree
to remain in isolation from first date forward. Hamilton stresses the
"voluntary" basis for this agreement, to counter later charges that CIA
had kidnapped the Frente and imprisoned them by force (p. 209).
3. With regard to the relection of the Bay of Pigs landing site,
Hamilton states that assanit plans were almost entirely in the hands of the
Pentagon (p. 203). Relations with Lem Jones' public relations firm in
New York are noted (p. 204).
4. A CIA project officer is flown to the Carries Bomer, flagship of
naval task force that was assembled in Puerto Rican waters. This
officer was to serve as Mission between the naval task force commanders,
CIA Headquarters and the Caban Brigade (p. 205).

"whitvash the New Frontier by keeping guilt on CIA" (p. 294).
