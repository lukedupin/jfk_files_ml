Resyour request for the couple sentences of factual
data as to why this document is classified", here. they are:
1. Ex post facts, since I was not associated
with Operation MCHCHAS during its existence, I can only
offer the following reasonabj. Surmise. As we now know,
during its tenure MICHCHAS was one of the most sensitive
operations conducted under DDO, Regis, repeatedly sanctioned
(in writing) by the DCI. The activity was deemed so sensi-
tive that it was controlled by through extremely restricted
handling channels I think it follows logically, at least
in my view, that any document produced by MICHAS, whether
a formal or informal one, would have been classified at
least SECRET.
2. Does the information in this document warrant
classification today. I think it does, and I believe the
current classification of CONFIDENTIAL is proper. Reading

MEMORANDUM FOR:
Pgs. 2 through 12 carefully, it is readily apparent that
some of the information on some of these pages was seemingly
acquired from/through sensitive sources/methods. Also
these pages contain frequent mention of FBI information con-
cerning many of the Peace Movement groups/organizations
acted FBI reports received by: MICHADOs were invariably
classified, for the most part CONF IDENTIAL.
The FBI's is the proper FOIA exemption for EX
3600, in my view, (b) (3) :
