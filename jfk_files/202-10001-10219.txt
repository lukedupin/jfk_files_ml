SENSITIVE

From: Erlg. Cen. Lansdale Ed
Subject: Operation Monogose Progress
Intelligence build-up by CIA includes efforts to recruit a
Cuban capionat in-clace and an official in an airlines cifice in
Iavana The CIA team placed in Finar cel Rio Province last
March was successfully re-eupplied by maritine means on
24 Jacy. The Navy and CIA have worked out a cooperative effort
to strengthen the U.S. security and intelligence program at
Cuantenamo.
The CAC continues to provide word from inside Cuba cover-
ing local security moves and popular unrest (unrest reportedly
increasing). A substantial recuction in oil refining and manu-
facture of tires one tubes is reported from CAC sources.
Economic pressure upon the Communist regime may be
increased by a ICPartment of Commerce move denying bunkering
facilities at U.S. poris to vessels under Sin-o-Soviet lhc carlier
carrying carpo to Cuta. State Lepartment reports having solicited
views of our Ambassador to Japan regarding possible approaches
to the Japanese asking them to cease sugar puricases from Cuba.
Programanca efforts of USA and CIA continue to apply pressure
upon the Cuan require ly focusing upon abuses of power and failure
of lcy programs such as medical and isod. The VA use of refuices
in interviews especially uncerlined this theme. I am looking into a
USIA proposal that we counter Co munici Cuta moves to i.crests
Latin A merica by participation in the autelic North Central A -rician
and Caribbean Cances set for August 11-2 in Minston, Jamaica: a
"free Cuta" team might be effective, with good publicity support.

Incident at Cuantanamoo occurred 26 may when a light Cuban
aircraft lancec there. Three Cutans had forcec the pilot, at
pistol point, to land the.m at our Naval Case. with State'a con-
currence, Lefense acted: the Cuban pilot flew home, the 3 Cuban
escapecs stayed on the base.
Fracturin the Fertine nas been given priority attention by
CIA. A senior case cither has been assigned full-time to this
specific action, and has preferential use of CIA assets. 11 24
desirable ciection targets, CIA has found several who see
vulnerabla (including the minister of National Leonony, Leon Kotl)
Priority Operations hicheule of 21 a y, sceking some positive
actions in beali of our project curian the next several weeks, nas
brougat a very healthy response from CIA and UUA. The CIA
determination to meet the challenge has surfaced four policy-type
questions which I note for you on behalf of CIA:
(4)
Jase 7, "Voice of Free Cuba, " is almost immediately
feasible, if the Croup will approve CIA arran: in with
R12,
Navy for use of a submarine. CIA has fir = plans for
worrying the Communist refine through braccasis
which would appear to come from local. dissertation groups
actively planning to harass the regime.
2). Task 19, CIA is prepared to disseminate leaflets on Castro's
failure to the Cuan population via balleon with a view of
increasing instability of the Communist faccine. The
technique is tested and CIA has plans to operate from a
surface ship in international waters. The Croup is
asked to approve the idea, including Navy support. This
could be operating in time to exploit the 26 July anniversary
of Castro's attack upon governnent forces at Santiago de
Cuba in 1933, for "the revolution' he has now betrayceo.
3). Task 19, CIA believes it can recruit some 27-man teams
for possible use in beeling up resistance groups within Cuba.
Croup approval is asked for I defense support in training,
holding, loquice. The "noise level' hazard is notee, but
this special project could be a innot unnuticed if the
proposed U.S. military envilct sent of Causans.

Tack 23, Counterfeit Currency to increase Ciban economic
problems is conciered feasible within 3.5.00 cays upon a
limited basis and in considerable scale within six months.
CIA asks the Group approval before proceeding with this
action.
Other Tasks.
I note here that CIA does not feel it has the operational
to undertake Tast No. 22, black-market activities or this time. ur-
ther that Task No. 11. Time magazine dissemination, woic require
operational facilities not now uvailable. I accept intefinite ceferral of
Task No. 22 and scrubbing of Task No. 11 on this basis.
The Lepartment of State reaction, to my effort to net the U.S.
into priority actions towards our project's goals, has been cisappointing
to the thus far. Apparently, my cencule of targets for special efforts
is accepted only as it may fit into long-ranzo, existing programs already
under way. If this is the theory of our project, I believe that the project
then becomes only a special reporting cvice and not a special U.S.
effort to via the goal of helping the Guans recapture their country
from a gang of Communists.
