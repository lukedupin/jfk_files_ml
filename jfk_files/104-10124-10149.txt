1. Attached to this necrecrundium is a copy of an article appearing
in the February 1960, issue of "Science and Kechanica" negagine, Page 2

2. TSD/2D under RD-177 and under the EARMORT Program has invested
$82,531 into the Identi-kit. Chief Hugh C. MOONALD, who is mentioned
in the article, is a cleared TUD complete. He was initially briefed by
Mr. ANDESSON, TSD/28. The Agency sponsored Mr. MOONALD's visit to
Washington and arranged his trip to Honnlish, Heswali, all in connection
with the development of the Identi-kit. The Townsend Corporation, work-
ing with MeONALD, has built a number of these kits and will advise the
Agency of those sold to foreign powers, etc. Mr. Pountney OHERS, Sales
manager of Townsend Engineering Corporation, is a TSD/28 cleared source
and understands the Agency's interest in the Kit. Townsend has also opened
a school for Identi-kit usera. Three persons from What's attended this
school.
3. The TSD project engineers are very dubious that MOONALD disclosed
classified information to unauthorised persons and speak highly of him.
They have especially noted his eagerness to assist us an various crash-type
projects of an malasnified nature.
4. Therefore, we have no desire to alienate his feelings. Nevertheless,
I would suggest that Mr. JONES, during his forthcoming visit to the West
Cost, interview Mr. MOONALD to determine, if possible, the reason for
inclusion of U. S. Intelligence interest in the attached article, thether at
not CIA was mentioned during his interview with the author and to further
brief MOONALD if necessary. Furthermore, the Identi-kit is expected to
receive considerable publicity as the sales program is stepped up.
5. A copy of this memorandum is being forwarded to RSD (Attn: Robert
SUNZINNAI) to deternins whether or not any other components of the Agency
are or have good NOMALD (possibly contacter (255V)
