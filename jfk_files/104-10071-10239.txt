12. The second incident involved a rather unstable American woman corres-
pondent Subject had met in Brussels. He had become friendly with her there and
had reverled to her his anti-Soviet epithies. Iier association with Subject
in Brussels was well known to some other Americans, including the person who
had introduced Subject to us. Constitution after Subject's retura home we learned
that this woman was also to be stationed in Boscen. moving that she would
mit to get in touch with Subject, we route his that she was coming and advised
him to avoid her. Before he had received our letter she had arrived in biscow
and had already visited him. She told his that her friend, the man who had
introduced us to Subject, had told her under no circumstances to phone or visit
Subject. (The man the had warned her had feared that she would cause Subject
to become suspect to the Soviet security authorities.) This incident upset
equilibrium, as he wrote to us, and although he said that he had taken notice
of our questions to him, he did not reply to one second letter.
