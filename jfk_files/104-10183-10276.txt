Chief, WH/PO/A
SUBJECT
: AMMUG/1.Operation
Target Analysis and Non-surfacible Leads
1. Reference is made to your memorandum date 18 June 1964
requesting Target Analysis Summary Reports on leads to be
exploited and lists of those leads which the Branch desires
not to be surfaced to the Intelligence company.
2. Attached are separate lists for each appropriate
Content of the Branch. The Branch is explaining nationals
of each country whose names have been mentioned or otherwise
cropped up during the debriefing of AMMUG/1. WH/2 considers,
at this time, that it is not feasible nor desirable to surface
any of these leads to the intelligence community, pending a
final determination as to the feasibility of pursuing some
of these new developments. The operational exploitation of
which are determined to be of no operational potential will be
released to your office on a continuing basis for surfacing
to assess appropriate agencies.
3. Attached also are seven completed Target Analysis
Summary Reports on:
a) Francisco Javier MILLA Pona
b) Jaime DURAN Ihermando
c) Socrates [salias PECUEKRO Sehuero
d) Jean Norbert MONTERO
e) Mauricio de la SELVA Venegas
f) Roque DALTUN Garcia


-2-
g) Noel GUERRERO Santiago
These individuals represent immediate targets on whom we
have already undertaken action. We anticipate that certain
selected other individuals from the lists cited in
paragraph one above will become targets, and accordingly,
are in the process of examining and investigating these.
Such these individuals are culled through, Target Analysis
Survey Reports shall be prepared and forwarded to your
office.

IL. Current Location
Hermanos Mirallies No. 5, Madrid, Spain (since February 1364, when
he went there from Cuba. In rardid, he was joined by his Dominican
girl-fried, Kicnare SALADH Decillio, whoa he married there. Meitber
has yet returned to the Dominican Republic.) His last known address

III. Vulnerabilities (for recruitment or defection)
None known. The only information on NMLA was acquired in April 1763
when he transited Mexico encroto to Cuba. At that time NMLA became
quite upset when "sello a Cuba" (left for Cuba) was stapped in his
passport. Accordingly, with this being the only past information on
Subject, we could be starting from "scratch".

VII. Evaluation
In that we presume that WRAN is a and-core Communist and at present
have scant information for a target assessment, immediate projects
for recruitment are virtually nill. lequirements can be lovied on
of 1/3 since 19 is a controlled source information could be
elicited from (1/3 and possibly from (1/3). As developed,
leads from forepoln could be followed up on, but, as indicated

could be used to elicit information on PROJECU through
thoir normal contacts
report on other Cuban targets.
VII. Evaluation
While there is no information on hand to indicate Subject is
approachable, the fact that he is in much more to A=00/A - when
might approach his - and has been identified to us he becomes of
operational interest. On the other side, the initiative is to continue our
interest and the information we might, awaiting the day for
the purpose of Cuba. At that time more definitive action might be
considered. His importance as a source of information on inside
Cuba and that country's intention and cscabilities on the Cominican
Republic cannot be discounted and morit our continued alertness to
his activities and thnroabouts.

Target Analysis Summary Report
AMMUG/1 Operation
SUBJECT: RDQUE DALTON Garcia
1. Significance of Target
DALTON is a recruited agent of the Cuban DGI. He has been
trained in guerrilla warfare, a/v, radio transmission,
and radio reception. AMMUG/1 claims that Subject is a
member of the Central Committee of the PCS. The
characterized Subject as having been used in the
the DGI in Cuban, which is a new contact with Mauricio
and C. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M.
Mexico City. In view of the above, Subject could be
expected to furnish considerable information on both the
PCES in El Salvador and his activities for the DGI.
II. Current Location
Subject was deported from El Salvador to Mexico in late
January 1964. On 16 June 1964 Subject was spotted by the
Salvador National Police in San Salvador, and is now
under surveillance. Exact address will be obtained by
the San Salvador Station.
III. Vulnerabilities
Able to kill lists Subject as his lending candidate for recruit-
ment by us. His reasoning on this is that Subject is not
highly motivated, has a weakness for women and the easy
lite, and a generally weak nature. AMMUG/1 says that
Subject is very intelligent, but never showed a real desire
to learn during his Cuban training. Subject was given
600 dollars to purchase a radio receiver upon his return
from Cuba, but he apparently spent the money on himself.
IV. Family and Relatives
Father (deceased) was U.S. citizen. One of Subject's three
brothers fought for the U.S. in Okinawa. A sister,
Margarita, is Mexican citizen who now is in Cubass a
student.

14-26

Subject is known personally by AMMUG-1 and by JURIN-1,
recently (recruited agent) oflSana Salvador Station) Subject
is presently under surveillance by the National Police
in San Salvador (Station hasUnilateral penetration of 24
the police/who might be used as a lead into Subject).
VII.Evaluation
From AMMUG-1's assessment of Subject, based on personal
knowledge and observation, it would appear that Subject
would not be a too difficult target to hit. However,
some of his personal characteristics which have made him
a handling problem for the DCI would presumably make him
a handling problem for the DCI. The problem is
the DCI since October 1963 might mitigate against our
consequences of would include, presumably, resumption of
his s/v channel. Nonetheless, AMMUG-1's claim that Subject
is a member of the Central Committee of the PCS (news to
us) makes his an operational target for that reason alone.

None incon. is is strossly anti-UNVALEEN. In that many itailan
exile circles as conserat down on the United States as a result
of the ununecessful Coptember 17:3 invasion of daitti, it is possible
that subject -ally turned to the "left" for assistance in overthrowing

1934 or 1947 (reported both ways) CUEEREXO was expelled

another sumber of the PCV (LIMAN) who was a recruitment

written by Madariga (CUBRERO's puedo) attempts to
point out reasons for its failure. Another document
written by Silvio Karyorga and Orlando cuant blames
"Andres" (GUEFREEO) for its failure. CUEKREO, loever,
must still be in the good graces of the Cuban 10. if
he is an agent in the "Hijos de VLEN, the only
serves as "interceptible" in the VLEN, or remnants which
are "interceptible. It seems highly unlikely that
CUEKREEO would be receptive to either recruitment or
defection. AMRUG-1 knows him personally and not with
his in Mexico in March 1964. It would appear that
AMRUC-1 could furnish more information about him
contact with CUEKREOO which would be helpful in an
assessment of CUEKREOO.
There is a report that CUEKREOO was in Nicaragua
clandesinely in 1962, he would undoubtedly be
arrested should be returned there and his presence
discovered by the Macarquans.
NOTT: This is not a complete target analyse and should not
be used as such.
