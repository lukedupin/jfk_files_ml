PCS DepifLire - Ivan Dmitriyevich OBYEDKOV
AION READER
1. For your information, we no longer carry Ivan Dmitriyevich OBYEDKOV
(201-779495), guard at the Soviet Embassy in Tehran, as PCS. lie was not listed
on ROGIVEN's April 1971 Presence List nor their December 1971 list. We assume
he has departed PCS.
2. During OBYEDKOV's tour in Tehran his wife, Yelena, served as principal
at the Soviet school. His son was apparently in Moscow living with Yelena's mother.
On 23 October 1969, ROARC reported the grandmother calling to check with OBYEDKOV
regarding a tutor for the child. They discussed the possibility of the tutor coming
for three times a week, at five rubles per hour, but OBYEDKOV, after checking with
his wife, decided on two times a week. OBYEDKOV seemed to be very fond of his
mother-10-law. According to our AESCREEN transcriber, she was the only one that
could tell OBYEDKOV what to do.
3. The following are comments made by our AESCREEN transcriber on OBYEDKOV
on 3 July 1970:
He is very security conscious, especially in dealing with "official people" or
superiors. He mentions his name to his friends freely, but refuses to say his name
when he knows that one of the superiors is calling, "this is the duty officer" OBYEDKOV
would say several times. He often lectures people when they violate security regulations
when talking on the telephone. OBYEDKOV has to be persuaded several times or even
(continued)

begged if someone needs help getting a vehicle or when asking for a favor, but when
he decides to help, OBYEDKOV will say with the problem until he gets results.
Although OBYEDKOV scores to be more cultured and better executed than her
husband, it is certain that only OBYEDKOV makes the final decisions. OBYEPROV
could be very pleasant, helpful and even kind, but it usually depended on his mood.
S. The only Soviet we noted as being friendly with OBYEDKOV during his tour
here was Rafik Nazhaf-Ogly ABDULLAYEV (201-808524), Third Secretary, suspect
RIS, probable KGB. When speaking to one another they used the familiar "ty".
We do not know the extent of their relationship.
4. Forwarded herewith is a photograph, date unknown, received from ROGWEN.
We have destroyed the Station file.

10. PERSONALITY, CHARACTER, AND HABITS:
Although Subject acted as a guard at the Soviet Embassy
in Mexico, he appeared to be fairly well educated and was
not subservient to any of the other Soviets, with the
exception of Counselor Boris Aleksandrovich KAZANTSEV
(201-028975). On one occasion Subject was reported to be
helping the daughter of Commercial Counselor Georgiy
Stepanovich VISKO with her arithmetic homework. On another,
Subject was asked about methods of producing metal wire,
a subject on which Subject was well informed as a result of
his having once worked for a wire factory.
Subject had a tape recorder at home which he liked to
listen to. lie also occasionally went fishing with other Soviets.
Subject told "Boris" in Moscow to build a large garage,
because he was bringing a big car back with him. lie also
asked whether Boris had bought a refrigerator and TV for the
apartment. On another occasion he was negotiating for a can
of paint to take back to Moscow with him to repaint "the
Moskvich". Subject and his wife were both buying watches
just before leaving Mexico. From the above it appears
that Subject was fairly well-off financially, for a guard.

12. INTELLIGENCE AFFILIATION:
Mexico City Station considers Subject suspect RIS because
ne appears better educated that his duties as a guard would
demand, because he seems financially better off than other
Soviet guards and because of his apparent association on
equal footing with Soviet RIS officers. DERYABIN in 1955
advised LNERGO that the surname OBYEDKOV was familiar to him
as the name of a person who was in the Guards Directorate of
the MVD in 1951.
In September 1967 DERYABIN and RASTVOROV said that they
neither recognized the face nor the name of the Subject.
(Both Ivan Ivanovich and Ivan Dmitriyevich were seen by the
defectors and they did not recognize either of them.)

part while he was stationed in Mexico.

took guard duty at the gate. Subject took messages for other

1. Reference A reported the departure of Subject from Mexico on 4 August
1965. The Station now believes that Subject departed PCS, and that he has possibly
been replaced by Ivan Petrovich KARCHIN, whose arrival on 14 August 1965 was
reported in Reference B.
2. According to LIENVOY, KARCHIN has been answering the telephone at the
Soviet Embassy, a duty for which Subject was previously responsible. According
to LICALLA, KARCHIN has also been taking guard duty at the entrance gate to the
Soviet Embassy, which Subject also had as one of his duties.
3. In addition, LIENVOY reported thet on 17 August 1965 that "a new school
director" had arrived at the Soviet Embassy, OBYEDKOVIA' had previously been the
director of the Soviet school in Mexico, and the fact that she had been replaced
indicates that she will not return to Mexico. The identity of the new school
director has not been established, although it may be KARCHINA.
4. The attached Soviet Personality Report (SFR) on Subject represents
a summary of Station information on him. It is noted that Subject is Listed as
suspect RIS, service unknown. his previous designation as suspect KCB was based
primarily on his presumed identity with the subject of 201-121531, which has now
been established as incorrect.

10. PERSONALITY: CHARACTERI HABITS:
Although Subject acted as a guard at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico, he
appeared to be fairly well educated and was not subservient to any of
the other Soviets, with the exception of Counselor Sorts Aleksandrovich
KAZANTSEV (201-028975). On one occasion Subject was reported to be
helping the daughter of Commercial Counselor Georgly Stepanovich VISKO
with her arithmetic homework. On another, Subject was asked about methods
of producing metal wire, a subject on which Subject was well informed as
a result of his having once worked for a wire factory (1).
Subject had a tape recorder at home which he likedto listen to. He also
occasionally went fishing with other Soviets (1).
Subject told "Boris" /paragraph 7c "above/ in Moscow to build a large
garage, because he was bringing a big car back with him. He also asked
whether "Boris" had bought a refrigerator and TV for the apartment. On
another occasion he was negotiating for a can of paint to take back to
Moscow with him to repaint "the Mosvich." Subject and his wife were
both buying watches just before leaving Mexico. (1). From the above it
appears that Subject was fairly well-off financially, for a guard?
11. CIRCULATION VITZAR:
(date unknown)
Subject reportedly had worked at the Serp I Molot
wire factory in Leningrad (1).
28 August 1962
Subject, accompanied by his wife and son,
arrived in Mexico as employee of the Soviet
Embassy. Subject replaced Vyacheslav
and the Soviet VECOROV (201-27334), "Juspect
GRU/ (201-27336) Viciço City Subject and his
family lived at Embassy, 4, reportedly in
Apartment 5 in January 1963 and in Apartment
4
in July 1965. (1).
22 July 1965
Subject's wife and son departed Mexico for
the USSR (5).
4 August 1965
Subject departed Mexico for the USSR (3).
Subject is believed to have been replaced by
Ivan Petrovich KARCHIN (no Station traces.)
12. INTELLIGENCE AFFILIATION: Suspect RIS.
The Station has no real evidence of Subject's intelligence affiliation;
however, because Subject appears better educated than his duties as a guard would
demand, because he seems financially better off than other Soviet guards, and
because of his apparent association on an equal footing with Soviet officers,
he is considered suspect RIS. It is further noted that Subject's predecessor was
suspect GRU.
13. INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY:
Unknown.
14. NON-INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY:
In Mexico City Subject primarily handled the main Soviet Embassy telephone (1)
and also took guard duty at the gate (3). Subject took messages for other Soviets,
recified them of meetings, and contacted them for appointments with each other.
He also occasionally drove one of the Embassy cars on errands. He kept a ledger
of the telegrams sent out by the Embassy and notified other Soviets when cables
caso in for them (1).

together in the school and children's camp, and RADVANSKAYA took over the camp
after Subject's wife left Mexico. RADVANSKAYA asked Subject's wife to tell her
(RADVANSKAYA's) daughter to enter the institute when she saw her in Moscow (1).

at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico since August 1963, no known RIS affiliation.

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCE
REPERENCE: 1004 204.1, 28 May 1965
1. Headquarters agrees that Subject is probably not identical with
Ivan Ivanovich OYBECKV (201-121531) as was carried by a full headquarters
accordingly assigned to the U.S. and U.S. to the U.S. and a full headquarters
and the U.S. to the United time med up no information other than that originating
from Mexico City Station, which has now been re-classified into the new
file. We are puzzled by the fact that MEX1-1850, dated 1 September 1962, the
first piece of cortespendence from Mexico City Station on Subject, reported
him as Ivan Ivanovich.
2. A photo contribution of the two individuals in this case is not
autisfactory proof that they are in fact two people because of the difference
in years and the time in the photographs. The pre-Mexico City traces on
Ivan Ivanovich reflect only a date and place of birth as identifying dopographic
1: is hoped that Mexico City Station can obtain soon identifying biographic
data on Ivan abritiyewich in order to firmly resolve the matter.
