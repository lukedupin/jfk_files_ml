about the dismissal of anyone who had proved to be ineffective.
AMENIM-1 is a proof friend of AMRHA-1 as a result of his father's
long standing relationship with him, but at this point has very
little respect for him as a result of, as he says.
The
failure to actually rake his organization into an effective body
of the enpare in activities which actually detract from the success
of the most prominent revenue. It remains that he is willing to
ilot: AMENIM-1 is a result of a result to reach unily amone the
military sections of the member groups at such time as KUMARK gives
him the go ahead.
4. Following his belief that the most important job at hand
is the development and maintenance of maritime reception points
along the north coast of PBRUMEN, AMDENIM-1 has devoted considerable
assessing assets among his exiled fisherman friends to make
contact the new information that the human associates still based in
PBRUMEN. The foundation for the state of the numerous as a
result of a variety of factors which make it difficult to

next rendezvous was a result of 12 August, however imminent bad
weather forestalled any chance of the ship. The results. The
effort to establish contact continues on the basis that the
Common system can be set up, it will be comparatively easy to es-
tablish further rendezvous and thus develop ralintes into the
north coast.
5. Cincidentally with the above AMDENIM-1 is continuing
his efforts to come up with radio operations or paramedicates and to obtain
candidates for infiltration. Based upon the experience this
effort is being made more selective in that the first point, self
sufficient personnel is greater than ever. The increasing diffi-
cations of the infant people inside makes it necessary to reduce the
size of the air and the air and to have people who can with-
stand the rigors of existing on the publics until they can
establish themselves with natives who are available. The

be able to pass point are of the type who want immediate action
and are unwilling to make the establishment establish a clandestine base
from which they can methodically develop the assets in place who
are essential to the growth and refinement of the system.
He has a number of people on tap who are qualified as candidates
for small guerrilla teams, but who are not capable of maintaining
themselves clandestinely until the time for guerrilla' action arrives.

it is intended that [SARDINAS] will be an investigator of
operational leads and an assistant to AMENIM-1 in
the handling of his fishermen and operational candidates.
b. $300. was given to AMDENIM-1 for passage to the
widow of AMELAD-1. He is the channel for this payment
