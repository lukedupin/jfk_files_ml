2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
10067-070/6
24 February 1907
SUBJECT: Estimate of Damage Which Could Accrue to CIA
Miami Through Prosecution of the Rolando
Laserrer Haitian Invasion Croup
1. The decision by the Justice Department to see: a
Canad Jury indictment against Bolande Rasterer and certain
or his associates is a potentially cencisive matter which
could result in extensive damage to CIA netivities in
Miami. Recent adverse publicity on the national scene and
in the Miami area have added substantially to the already
sizeable embarrassment potential. Some of the main sectors
of danger to CIA equities are described below.
2. Basic national publicity regarding student and
foundation topics have already attracted attention of the
local press to the CIA in general. Usually any reference
to CIA covert activities lends the press to check files for
recrences to any such activities lecaily. Moreover, before
this action could be taken, the story regarding the Pan
nertican Foundation and the University of Mian i. Brothe, and
the press immediately concentrated on this topic. The CIA
Chief of Station learned through personal press contacts
this was partly a matter of luel and partly because
of the friendly and cooperative attitude of chose press
contracts. Although several editorials highly critical of
CIA have been published and the reply of wire service
etories has been given such space, as yet there has been
no local follow-up aimed at putting CIA or the CIA Station
on the spot. However, the situation remains delicate,
ince, even with much good will, local nevemen cannot
afford to let themselves be scooped by outsiders concerning
articles in their own back yard.
3. Any now story, such as the 23 February story in
the
cormal TÃ©ilure on sequested CIA connection with
recruement or Cucan pilots for the Congo, the possible
results of inquiry made on 21 February by three students
connected with the University of Mianl newspaper The
Terrienne, or further reccutions concerning the
furntion Foundation, could easily trigger publicity with
an inevitable focus on the Such Canpns or the University
of Miani and on the Miami Station cover firm.
