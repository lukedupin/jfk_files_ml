12 July 1972
director, Donnatic Contact Service (033)

Belando Kastefrezer Dr., Military Arranment Corporation, Powder Spring,

1. Attached per referent telephone conversations in copy of
Dsm and Bradstreet report as requested on Hillary Arranment
and
in
Dress
wrote
that Chairman of the Board, is Mitchell Livingston Werbell, III.
Wertbell is a former orifice of Strategic Services (OSS) office
hours to this writer during assignments in China during WII.
2. This Agency, as well as other government agencies, have
considerable information on Werbell. He is an old and unsavory,
musaclicted, contact of the Miami Field Office dating from 1959.
He is of dubious character and reputation who had and has been
involved in graduates achievement and implementation. He has
had any other experience, difficulties in the work of the
3. Werbell was involved with Dapal Jasperar Senior, in
connection with the abortive Haitian invasion in 1967- This may
throw a different light or possible source development of young
Rolandc Jr. Any approach to his asould be executed with some degree
of caution. We do not desire to get involved with Werbell. However,
we cannot foresee any objection to planned debriefings of Maferrer
Mr. following his trips to Latin America and other areas, in pursuit
of FRT and possible information of operational significance.
4. If we can be of further assistance in this matter, please advise.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Rolando MASFERRER, Jr.
1.
Please be informed of a possible future contact-Rolando
MASFERRER, Jr., recently promoted to Vice-President of Sales, Mili-
tary Armament Corporation, Washington D.C. office, 905 L' Enfant
Plaza, #4020. He is also associated with Parabellun Corporation,
another military weapons firm. Subject, born approximately 1945,
in Habana, Cuba, is believed to be a naturalized citizen.
2.
Subject makes frequent sales trips to Latin America. Because
of the nature of his main product (machine pistols with silencers) he
has good access to top Latin American governmental officials and
the companies are not the most important industry. He is also
American presidents. He should be a good sub- of information on
the current status of arms sales in Latin America; internal security,
military armament levels, order-of-battle, and internal politics in
host countries; and, if needed, status of Cuban exile movement. He
is presently on a sales mission to Colombia and is scheduled to return
in Ltd-June.
3.
MASFERRER, Jr. has been a Miami resident since 1939 and more
recently lived in Atlanta. He will permanently locate in the Washing-
ton, D.C. and returns from his Colombian trip.
4.
Subject is not to be confused with his father by the same
name, the infamous Rolando Arcadio LASFERRER y Rojas (201-42669).
Masferrer Sr. was a former Cuban Senator and leader of a dreaded
private army of Batista enforcers called "Los Tigres (Tis Tigers)".
He is presently serving in a U.S. federal prison for attempting
to organize a 1957 invasion of Haiti in order to set up a base
of operations against Cuba. Masferrer Sr., violently anti-Gastro,
was involved in numerous Cuban exile operations against Cuba during
the last last year.
5.
I was Subject's Commanding Officer in the Florida National

Florida, where both belonged to a Florida National Guard Huts.
Peterson known Haeferrer socially as well having met frequently
for "a few years."
According to Petercon, based on his observations, subject
is a personable, intelligent, individual vio appears trustworthy,
and of sound mind and judgment. He is a solid citizen completely
assimilated in the American mainstream; intensely interested in the
U.S. political processes. Politically, be is of the most important
interest in the American population. He is a frustrated ability and
integrity. To highlight this point, Peterson mentioned that Masterfurer
spurned lucrative cash offers for 'under the table' deals to engage
in illegal weapons trade in Latin America. He refused these offers
to operate in legitimate business circles.
4. Young Orlando takes a sociable drink; has no known bad
habits. He has a keen eye for attractive females, but no more so
than all healthy males. Peterson said he would not hesitate to
recommend subject for a position of trust and confidence.
5. Halamo Haeferrer, Jr. served with the Green Berets, elite
U.S. Army unit whose members require special security clearances by
the military.
6. Peterson underlined his previous statement that Orlando

Bays, a former Cuban Senator who was leader of the notorious "Lone
Tiggen", the demanded army of enforcement under Bettist.

unsolicited, contact of the Hizal Field Office dating from 1959.
He is of dubious character and reputation who had and has been
involved in grandizies schemes and international amel details. He has
had a very good sense of the development of the U.S. and the
3. Werbell was involved with Belag, Massistant Gantier, in
correction with the abcrtive Baitian invesico in 1987- this may
throw a different light on possible noure development of young
Bolande Dr. Any approach to his should be executed with some degree
of caution. We do not desire to get involved with Werbell. However,
we cannot foresee any objection to planned debriefing of Naferrer
Dr., Malloring his tripe to Latin America and other areas, in pursuit
of PIZ and possible information of operational significance.
4. If we can be of further assistance in this matter, please advise.

12 June 1972
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Rolando MASFERRER, Jr.
1.
Please be informed of a possible future contact--Rolando
MASFERRER, Jr., recently promoted to Vice-President of Sales, Mili-
tary Armament Corporation, Washington D.C. office, 905 L' Enfant
Plaza, #4020. He is also associated with Parabellum Corporation,
another military weapons firm. Subject, born approximately 1945,
in Habana, Cuba, is believed to be a naturalized citizen.
2.
Subject makes frequent sales trips to Latin America. Because
he
has
been
an
important
system
of
the
has good access to top Latin American governmental officials and
military and security officers. He has personally met many Latin
American presidents. Ho should be a good source of information on
the current status of arms sales in Latin America; internal security,
military armament levels, order-of-battle, and internal politics in
host countries; and, if needed, status of Cuban exile movement. He
is presently on a sales mission to Colombia and is scheduled to return
to mid-1972.
3.
MASFERRER, Jr. has been a Miami resident since 1959 and more
recently lived in Atlanta. He will permanently locate in the Washing-
ton, D.C. area when he returns from his Colombian trip.
4.
Subject is not to be confused with his father by the same
name, the infamous Rolando Arcadio MASFERRER y Rojas (201-42669).
Masferrer Sr. was a former Cuban Senator and leader of a dreaded
private army of Batista enforcers called "Los Tigers(Tn) Tigers")
He is presently serving in a U.S. federal prison for attempting
to organize a 1967 invasion of Haiti in order to set up a base
of operations against Cuba. Masferrer Sr., violently anti-Castro,
and
the
universe
numerous Cuban exile operations against Cuba during
the last decade.
5.
I was Subject's Commanding Officer in the Florida National
Guard and sometimes saw him socially while in Miami. Although Cuban
by birth, he now feels that he is an American. Politically anti-
Communist, he joined the National Guard(while not under duress from
the draft) to become a "Green Beret." He is polite and correct in
his social relationships. I received a letter from him, 7 June 1972,
informing me of his impending move to the Washington, D.C. area. He


solicited my aid in finding a local army reserve unit.
6. If you are interested in exploring this possibility further,
please feel free to contact me at any time. I could suggest cautions
and method of contact or introduction. Subject is unwitting of my
Agency employment.

4. Subject has developed what could be interpreted
as a certain patrrotise for this country. During conver-
sion of the 1970s, the 1970s of the 1970s were
the U.S. I believe that the fact he volunteered for U.S.
nilitary training reflects not only the selfish motives
of Leccing Special Forces qualified but also a sense of
duty. I also believe that his recent statements to me
regarding international security matters is not merely
empty. I would not be able to see how to continue to contribute
sociation. The question involved in the national security
and the U.S. is the question involved in the
responsibility of any Agency association as well as subse-
quent careful handling. lie would need to get away from
the "Flagler Street Commando syndrome" of visual and verbal
bravado. He would need instruction to discern rumor from
Cact, to and to assess the reliability
of action.
6. I an sure that the Subject is vercuitable. The
question is what degree of association with the Agency
would be appropriate. If the decision is made to approach
the Subject, may I suggest that his association be initially
limited to Agency briefings and debriefings before and after
his-trips to Latin America. Since his reliability is established
and the accuracy of his reporting is proven then further
utilizatious maybe possible. Since this financial situation
seems to be secure! I am sure he could be handled on a non-
pay basis.
7. Subject is scheduled to leave on a two-week business
trip to Venezuela and Colombia beginning in early August 1972.
Ilo claimed to have appointments with a Venezuelan Air Force
General and with Venezuelan national security officials in
