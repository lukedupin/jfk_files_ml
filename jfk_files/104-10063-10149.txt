WANTED TO WORK WITH CLEAVERS. PETER O° N E A L (201-856553),
FOR EXAMPLE, RECENTLY LEFT THE COUNTRY AND DONALD C o X
(201-851941) CLAIMS THAT HE WANTS TO MINIMIZE FURTHER ASSO-
CIATION WITH CLEAVER SINCE CLEAVER HAS SUCCEEDED IN "ONLY
IRRITATING THE ALGERIANS. (MCNAIR HAS NOT SEEN COX FOR
ABOUT TWO WEEKS.)
3. MCNAIR, HOLDER AND OTHER HIJACKERS LIVE AT THE BP
POINTE PESCADE VILLA AND RARELY SEE CLEAVER WHO IS LIVING
IN HIS VILLA IN EL BIAr. MCNAIR SAID ALGERIANS KEEP A
"CLOSE EYE* ON CLEAVER AND HIS WIFE, ALSO NOW IN ALGIERS.
4. THE HIJACKERS HAVE BEEN ISSUED NO DOCUMENTATION BY
THE ALGERIANS. THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR MOVEMENTS
EXCEPT THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED NOT TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE THE
PROVINCE OF ALGIERS.
5. MCNAIR SAID HE HAD NOT REALLY BELIEVED THAT THE
ALGERIANS WOULD RETURN TO THE US THE ONE MILLION DOLLARS
INVOLVED IN THE DELTA HIJACKING. HE SAID HE WAS AWARE BEFORE
THE HIJACKING WAS PLANNED THAT THERE WERE REPORTS THAT THE
500 THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE WESTERN AIRLINES HIJACKING HAD
BEEN RETURNED, BUT HE DID NOT BELIEVE THE REPORT SINCE HE

ALSO AWARE THAT THE HIJACKERS IN THAT CASE WERE FREE IN
ALGIERS. ALSO, MCNAIR REASONED THAT SUCH A LARGE SUM WOULD
OVERRIDE ALGERIAN POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THEIR DECISION
ON THE MONEY'S DISPOSAL.
6. THE RECENT RAID ON THE BPP HEADQUARTERS BY ALGERIAN
AUTHORITIES WAS TRIGGERED BY CLEAVER'S OPEN LETTER TO PRESI-
DENT B o U M E D I E N E DEMANDING RETURN OF THE HIJACK
MONEY. CLEAVER'S LETTER WAS WRITTEN WITHOUT THE APPROVAL
OF THE REST OF THE BPP MEMBERS IN ALGERIA AND CAUSED A
MAJOR SPLIT IN THE PARTY.
7. MCNAIR APPEARED AT EASE IN FLANIK'S OFFICE AND
QUITE TALKATIVE, ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION CENTERED
ON HIS TRIP TO ALGIERS. HE APPARENTLY SURPRISED TO FIND
ALGERIA SUCH AN ADVANCED COUNTRY. HE HAS NO DOCUMENTATION
EXCEPT AN AMERICAN DRIVER'S LICENSE AND WHEN ASIED IF HE
WISHED TO APPLY FOR A US PPT, HE REPLIED THAT "WE HAVE NO
WHERE TO GO, so I GUESS NOT." MCNAIR EXPECTED TO RETURN
LNFALL NEXT FEW DAYS TO SEE WHAT PROGRESS FLANIK HAS MADE ON
PPT APPLICATIONS.
8. SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF ABOVE INTERVIEW BEING SENT
