18. WISCAPLET-3:
During this reporting period WISCARLET-3 produced
eleven disseminations and contributed to four others. As a chief of one
of the operations sections of his service, it appeared that he would
continue to have excellent access. However, in December WISCARLET-1
reorganized his service and ostensibly reduced our agent's area of respon-
sibility and access. WISCARLET-3 was slightly depressed at this occurrence
as he believed, and rightly so, that he had not merited this reduction.
The results were not significant. The results were not significant
continue to use WISCARLET-3 in special operations and that the reduction in
responsibility was solely to take WISCARLET-3 out of the licelight. Thus,
our agent is still able to report on the sensitive operations of his ser-
vice. As a result of this and his past performance, WISCARLET-3 was given
a salary increase beginning January 1973.

STATUS OF PROJECT AGENTS:
13. This period showed that while WEGCALET-3 does have a highly
responsible position within his organisation, he still is being ordered to do
special assignments by the chief of the service. These assignments usually
be
used to be used by well and/or long and unusual vorking hours. This pre-
clude regular schedule of the service. The first time of the event is
average of once a week. WSCGARET-3, along with his normal routine duties,
was involved in a number of varied activities during the reporting period
which he duly reported to the Station. He continues to investigate all
issues of the event. The first time of the event was to be given to the
a small team to Cuetta, Colombia where they uncovered and destroyed a small
printing abop which vas engaged in the fabrication of false Venezuelan identity
cards. He continues the investigation of the activities of Sergio Pieda Ruis,
and the production of the production of the production of the production
communications has been conservative. The agent now contacts the case
officer at the letter's home during the evening hours. This doesn't obviate
the need for an RS-708 system, but until the details for a concealment device
that will be appropriate for WSCGARET-3's rather aportan office are worked
out, phone contest is necessary. During the reporting period WSCGARET-3
produced three disseminations and contributed to one other.

nao que van opareciendo y doddie co agrupan tom
porolmente gran ndmore de personas.
Puntualizando lo antao dicho exista un acorupug
to que sirva como Basn do Operaciones en la rogión, iden-
tificado como Aeropuerto de "La Contella", con una longi-
tud de ochocientos (800) metros de pista do tirra, sien-
do este al de mayor tamilo y dodo donde se hacen los
traobordos en avionotas nas pegaofias que solen a los pro-
pios cempos mineros, situados an un Arso no mayor de quin
ce (15) minutos de vuelo.
En el caso de "La Salvación", este campanento-
minero se encuentra exactamente a unos siete minutos de -
vuelo saliendo del Aeropuerto "La Contelle". La pista de
atozrizaje eo igualmente de tirra con apenas trocientos
ochanta (300) metros de longitud, lo que hace sumamente -
poligroso au utilización, mas odn cuando observamos que -
ao encuentra rodeuda de árboles giganteasos que alcanzan-
40 y 50 metros da. altura. Por las coractorísticas descri-
tas, en esta pista han ocurrido varios accidentos óbreos-
causando muertos, horidos y varios aporutos destruidos de
los cuales actualmente se pueden opreciar en el sitio cín
co totalmente insovibles; igualmente no so utilizon los
equipos de radio entre les avionotas y los corporuerto, a
xiotiendo el poligro latenta do un accidento por al cho-
que de aporatos tanto en el aire como en la propia piate,
ya que generalmente existen nubos muy bajas que aponas
permiten ver la pista como un paqueño claro en medio de
lo selva! esta situación empoorn cdn m.s por la irraspon-
obilidad de los linos aéreas y los propiuo pilotos,
quiones buscando mayor beneficio sobresargan los aviones-
a veces hasta con el dobla del paoa permitido, sin que a-
xista ningdn control de Comunicaciones para regular tal a
normalidad. Un ajemplo claro lo constituye la línea "A--
SERCA", que en un año registró trece accidentes en lo ra-
gión.-

2. Condiciona de vida y de trabajo de in explain
2. 1. Las condiciones de vida do la población que al
canza aproximadamente a unao 6.000 personas -
(poro que llegó a toner al año pusedo unas
-
15.000), dejan mucho que desosar en el aspacto-
sonitario, habitacional y moral. Las oquas -
que corren par el lugar están continidad por
el aspercimientos indiscriminado de excremenos
on las agrones de los quabradas y pequeños -
ríos, así como en el interior del propio poble
do. Las enfermedgdos, como el paludiamo y ami-
biscis, se observan con bastante frecuencia -
por falta de asistencia y control santiario
les enfermedadas vonóneo abundan por no exis-
tir un riguroso control sobre el gran námero -
de prostitutza que existen en la población. La
totalidad de las vivieridas estan construidas -
con cartones, tables y láminao do zinc, que ag
cosemente protagen a sus moradores de las in-
clamancias del tiempo, siendo mas grave la ci-
tusción por la gran cantidad de niños que son
llevados por sus pudres al lugar, por danda pa
ligreso e inpropiado poro ellos, sin que tam-
poco exista ninguna regulación a control al -
respacto.-
La prostitución cobra marcado incremento en
as
tas zonas, atrayendo mujeres deodo diferentes-
lugares de la Rupública y de pafes vecinos ca
mo Colombia y Broail, que se agrupan en impro-
vícados bares oituduo dentro de la población,
provocando hechoz rfiidos con la moral que se
llevan a cabo en presencia de nifioo y de honga
tas fanilies de minorou.-
Prolifera en suo diferentes manifrestaciones el
juego, siendo lou ma comunos la barjes y los-
dadoo, binges, etc., estos dítimos son transmi
tidos per altavoces dandole un aspecto de fe-

ria nocturna al poblado.
2. 2. Generalmente los mineros forman grupo de tra-
bajo constituyendo pequonão sociedades entre -
lau que se reportirá la genancia que logren ob
tonor, pero como cercen do recursos indiapan-
subloa 30 ven obligados a incluir como socios-
a personas que les pretan lou implamentos de
trabajo o que financian ou alimentaci6n, cona-
tituyendo esta forma una espocie de explota -
ción si as toma en cuenta que generalmente esq
geran los cantidades consumidas por los mine-
ros. Los compradores de diamantes orrovchan -
la necesidad de vender los diamantes encontra-
dos por los mineros, para pagarios a precios -
muy por debajo de su velor real y los espocula
dores.suprovchan para elevar los precios de --
los alimentos, medicinas, stc., llegando en o-
portunidades de escaséz a vender hasta en Bs -
40 un kilogramo de orroz. Actualmente dada la
comptancia y los constantes viojas que esac -
tuan al lugar las diferentes líneas óreas, en
tre ellas: "ASERCA", "AEROVEN", "GATIZSA", "LA
TINCARGA", "AEROTECNICA" y "COMERAVIA", los -
precios han dejado do ser tan exagerados.-
3. Actuación de los autoridades:

presentada por un Comisario General de nombre-
JOSÉ TOMAS GAONA ESPINORA, pero ol verdodaro -
control sobre la población es ejercido por la-
Guardia Nacional y para el momento de la pre-
sente avariugación estaba constatuida por un -
grupo de cuatro Guorsias, comandados por un Ca
bo de opollido CARPIO; este grupo es completa-
mente nuevo en el lugar, a refz de la solide -

funcionza. Entrevictedos aliquoso concernientes-
y minaros del lugar, pudínoo obtener informa-
ción coincidente entre los mimos infernants:
de lao/actividades desagradables para elles da
sarrollodésa por les afectivos do la Guardia Na
cional, citando stropilloo cometidos por al Ta
niente LUIS PRIN y el Cabo PÍNATE, destacando-
entre elles los siguientes:
que cuando al Tariente LUIS PRIN VILLEGAS era
el Jefa de la Guardia Nacional en "La Salva -
ción", existía el Bar "Bojuguero", cuye dueña-
aparentemente era la ciudadana PETRA GUAPE, -
quien era públicamente amante dol Teniente -
PRIN, ya que eran vistos caminar tonados de la
mano por el pueblo y el Tte. dormía junta con-
ella en al lacel dal mismo Bar, lo grave de -
los hochas, según revalan los informantes, es-
tebe en que a las nuevas de la noche el Tanien-
te ordenaba el cierre do todos las denés barres
naticificandole a los mineroa por internedio de
los propios Guardias que si quevian segufi to-
mando podían continuar en el Bar "Bojuguero".
donde en varios oportunidades se vió a los -
Guardias uniforrados depcchando cervezas a
-
los clientes en al interior de oas Bar, por lo
que co generalizé entre los pobiadores la ices
de que el Tto. PRIN tenía parte en el negocio.
Igualmente informan los entrevistados que los
Guardias Nacionales que comandaba el Tte. PRIN
VILLEGAS, especialmente el Cabo PÍNATE, so da-
ban a la terea de padir a los mineros parte de
la tircra que acaban y donde podría haber o -
nó diomanten; igualmente cobraban una especie-
de impuoto a las personas que administraban -
las casas da jusego. Narran los personas entry
vistadas que en una oportunidad los nincros, u
no da elles menor de edad, se jugaban de manos
en al public. resultando golpeado el caner y -


- 6 -
qua ou aigna, quien 10 golpe6, sin nalo inten-
ción, no opuso ninguna roalotencin y volunta-
riamonte monifesté a la Guardio Nacional que -
estaba depuesto a envier al módico por ou
cuenta a su amigo y a pagar un erasto si era-
necesario, cosa esta que no sucedió puso el -
Toniante ordenó esposarlo y propinarle cinco -
planezoo en presencia del pueblo para sof sen-
tar un precedents de respeto, según expresó.
Sa pudo conocer que el lino pasado, por el mes-
de Noviembre, por orden de la Guardia Nacional
es llevó a cabo una reunión en el Bar del Se-
ñor ZABALA, y donde asistieron ademán el Coro-
nel VALDERRAMA y el Tte. Gnel BECERRA, proce-
dentes del Destacamento acantonado en San Fex-
nando de Apure. En esta reunión se planteá la-
necesidad de que celaborazar los comerciantoa-
de la localidad para la construcción del Comán
do de la Guardia Nacional en sua mina; los co+
merciantes aceptaron hacerlo y negocio a nogo-
cio fueron visitados dando on 100 y 290 boliva
res cada uno; esta colaboración no fué del a-
grado de los comerciantos, pero por temor a
presalias prefirieron colaborar no pudiendo da
terminar la cantidad recogida, pero se estima-
le varios milos de bolívares; con la suma do -
dinero donada so contruyó un gelróln de zinc.-
cerado con elambres de pidas que en la actuali
dod hace las vocas de Comando de la Guardia Na
cional en "La Scivoción".
Un Mayor de los Fuerzae Aéroas Venezolancs de-
apellido SEGUIA, su ha hecho en los minus hom-
bre importantes en su condición de comerciante.
Adquirirá junto con otros ocios 10 Línes aérea
"ASERCAY, piloteando peroonalmente uno de sus
aviones, específicamente el idantificado con -
las siglue: YV-C-MSI-, donde transporta perso-
nas y carga, especialmente carveza traida des-


do Valencia y Marsany, constituyandoa así en-
el mayor distribuidor de corvou an la mina; a
damála pouda la áica fúbrico de hiels que exig
to en el lugar y una plinti para tratamiento -
del agua, la que iguolinonte venda en la cina.-
Estos negocios estan adminitrodos por un her-
mano suyo, y que los maculinarias de la compa-
ñx que fabrica hielo y potabiliza el agua, --
dictinguida con el nombre de SAFER, fueron --
tratoldodas a la mina en un avión de corge de
las Fuerzas Aéreas.-
Esta conisi6n pudo vor personalmente al Mayor-
SEGUIA en su función do piloto comercial co --
brando a los mineros que transportaba; igual-
mente la comisi5n le observó en troje civil, -
pero según informaron las personas interroga-
das, este militar frecuentemente ha sido visto
con ou uniforma de las Fuerzas Aéreas, por lo
que ao puede deducir de que actualmente se
a
cuentra activo en nuestra Fuerza Aéreas.
De la actuación de los Guarcinas Nacionalos que
actualmente se encuentran en "La Solvación" al
mando del Cabo CARPIO, no hay escuaciones por
atropellos, soluente y eso ao pudo noter, to-
leran el juego y protegen algunos bares que --
permancan abiesios hasta pasada dia hora nor-
mal. Entes estos bares figura uno donde se
-
practice la prostitución y cuya ducía, de nom-
bro ROSA, se jeta pblicamente de sor "la púl
mera dama de La Solvación" por el hacho de ser
le amante del Cabo CARPIO.-
En converoacción sostenida en un plano emistaso
con ol Cabo CARPIO, éste manifestá a la comi-
sidán que ellos aceptaban regalos en dinero de
parte de los mineros por el poco sueldo que de
vengaban en un lugar como sea donde el costo -
de la vida es tan clevado.

Primera Parte
$ SITUACION EXISTENTE EN VENEZUELA
11 Generalidades
En 1970 la producción diamantifora Venezuela, salcará 508.661
cquilatés, siendo esta producción la más alta en la historia de
esta actividad en el país. Con relación a 1559 le producción
ha tripliccedo según se desprende de los cussos anexos de pro-
ducción.
Esta producción ha sido lograda en su cest totalidad bajo al
sistema de libre aprovachamiento, sinánico da sub-desarrollo
en los aspectos técnico, social y económica. En al aspecto téc-
nico el su-bdeserrollo se manifiesta en los sistemas rudimenta-
rios da explotación que no permiten el cabal prevachamiento del
yacimiento.
En el aspecto social son de todos conocidas las condiciones in-
frahumanas en que se desenvuelve la vida del dinero, con la fal-
ta de servicios elementales, vías de comunicación, falta de seguir-
dad personal imposibilidad de lograr una suparcación personal a tras-
vés de una comunidad y familia estables.
En el aspecto económico los circuitos de marcados existantes hacen
que el minero se encuentra a marced de los correspondores organizados
a quienes vanden su producción en les condiciones que le son fije-
des.
Por otra parte hay que satalear que el libra aprovachamiento solo
pueda ser utilizado donde concurren ciertas condiciones físicas
como alta concentración del diamante y agua suficiente para las
técnicas primitivas de lavado.

Con el nivel de producción actual y la ricuzca pctencial exia-
tente 00 hace nacucorio afectuar modificaciones en la forma de
aprovechamiento, introduciendo técnicas industriales de trabajo.
Iguslamento es de cohnior que la ley y reglamento actuales de Mi-
nao coton del año 1944, cuando la producción diamantifora no al-
canzaba ni oiguiora el 10% de los niveles actuales. Su modifica-
ción es imperativa a efectos de introducir nuevas regulaciones
donsonas con los técnicas existentes inclusive en países menos de-
sarrollados que Venezuela.
No es pretende recomendar la eliminación de la explotación del
dismante bajo el sistema de libre aprovechamiento por los impli-
caciones soció-políticas que esta medida tendría, pora si comple-
mantarla con la utilización de métodos industriales de aprovechamien-
to ammercada dentro de una legislación actualizada.
El Ministerio de Minas conoce los permanentes de la explotación
bajo el libre aprovechamiento desde hace tiempo, recalcada por los
Ings. Francisco Izquierdo y Oleg Andreiav, expertos del MMH, en
varias oportunidades.
Le actividad diamantifera en Venezuela revites anorma importancia
asgán puoda compricera en las cifras siguientes, (sobra datos de
1570):
Representa el 1,5% de la producción mundial, estimada ofi-
cialmente en 46 millones de quilatas.
Utiliza una fuerza de trabajo entre 10.000 y 15.000 mineros.
De ia cifra anterior es difícil determinar el porcentaje de
venezolanos y de Extranjeros indocumantados que trabajan en
asta actividad.
Aporta a la Nación ingresos fiscalizados de 30.millones
de bolivares de los cuales el Gobierno percibe en calidad

Gor información bancaria obtenida extroficialmente, he-
mao pedido subor cua procedentas del exterior fué sigreg
a Ciudad Bolívar una suma corcans a los 70 millones da bo-
11voros dostinada a compora de diamantos durante 1970.
Adoptendo una cifra conservadora de 50 millones de boliva-
res como unlor de la producción de diamantes, esto represen-
toría un 10% del aporte que hace 11 Producto Territorial
Bruto el Sector Minero.
La explotación del diamante determina una serie de inversio-
nosa en actividades conoxas, altamente remuneradores por lo ge-
neral, como por ejemplo las líneas de avinción locales para
transporte de mineros como Aerotécnica, Comeravia, Gatic G.A.,
Tanca, etc.
Fuente da ingresos para las Municipidades. El Comercio en
el Guaniamo cancela E. 15.000 mensuales a la Municipalidad
del Distrito Caddño del Estado Boliver ( sin prestación de
servicio alguno hasta la fecha.).

12.- Encoefficciones dol Oicmente venozoleno
Origan
El diamanto venozolona proviene da Guayana ( Provincia de
Rorains y Cuchivero).
Ea un diamante de aluvión 6 sea que se encuentra en el couce de
los ríos, 6 forma en terrazas aluvionales depósitos ubicados a
poca profundidad; 3 a 15 matros de acuerdo a la topografía.
En algunas regionas del mundo, los diamantes se encuentren en
"chimeneas" 6 "pipes": "nicice fuentes primarias de diamantes
conocidas- ejemplo: Kimberlay (Africa del Sur) - en otras en
depósitos slivionales como en Venazuela 6 en las playas del Sur
Deste de Aftica; 6 en una combinación de ambos - ejemplo : Yaku-
tia, Rusia.
No todas las "chimineas" son productivas y 75% de la producción
mundial provienes de aluvión.
La riqueza de los depósitos dependa:
- del tenor en diamantes del material existida
- de la proporción entre los tipos, tolle-industrial-bort
- de las características de las piedras (morfológicas y de
color)
Tenor
En Venozuela la cantidad de quilates por tonelada métrica es sa-
tisfactoria; para al Guanima se pueda evaluar en 0,4 - 0,5 qui-
lates por toneleda métrica - cantidad que justifica la parmanen-
cia ey el sitio del Minero de Libra Aprovechamiento. ( 1 quilata=
0,24gramos) 33
Los valores promedios da los tenores de los yacimientos del grupo
De Geers en Africa del Sur son de 0,2 a 0,3 - según se desprende
del Informe Anual 1969 de Da Beers Consolidated Mines LTD.

Proporciin Talla - Industrial = Sort
La linea discorria entre talla e industrial es a veces artitraria
y no sobre. Generalmente el diamente propio para la talla se
caractorica así:
- está bien conformado
- es blanco o ligeramente coloreado
- pesa nós de 1/20 quilates (10 mg.)
Son comunes en nuestras yacimientos unos diamantes triangulares
(cquilaterales de 2 a 3 mm de lado?) llamados "panelss" clasifi-
cados como industriales pero que pueden aprovecharse para talla.
El bort, oscuro, sirve para hacer polvo de diamante.

Forma
Característica: morfológica que define al diamante de talla como
un:
octaedro
rombo dodecacedro
cubo.
formas intermedias entre las 3 anteriores
La forma cúbica es la más rara; generalmente en Venezuela hallamos
octaedros; muy semajantes a los de Sierra Leone y que aparecen en
la hoja - DIAMANTE DE TALLA - DIFFERENCIAS MDRFOLOGICAS -
Siendo de origen aluvionario se puede precisar que presentan aris-
tas redondadas y no nítidas, significativo de un posible arreste
hasta su lugar de extracción.
Los octaedros de "chimeneasa" tienen aristas nítidas y perfectas
(foto). En la operación de talle, el octaedro es el mas apropiado
para la talla americana 6 full cut 6 corte clásico del brillante.
Estructura
Característica morfológica que corresponde al modo de cristelización
de la piedra, observándose una de las dos particularidades siguien-
tes:
- estrías en les facetas 6
- estratos en el cuerpo de la piedra
Generalmente nuestras piedres presentan estas capas 6 estratos,
perfectesantes observables al microscopio birccular, lo cual puede
marcer un cuidado especial en la operación talla.

piedras
Las piedras grandes son rares - En 1970 fué descubierta en el
Guanfazdo una piedra de 57,85 quilates, ( adquirida en el sitio
por Bs. 65.000 avalueda en 104.000 8. por el M.M.H. e los efectos
del Impuesto de explotación.)
En esta aspecto. el comercio lícito hacía escritica toda investiga-
ción y solo as dispona tanto en Venezuela como en gran parte de
las áres de producción de datos indicativos relativos el tamaño:
por eja: lo en Ghana es frecuante la piedra de más de 2 quilates;
en Dultitspan - Sur Africa, el ritmo de aparición de piedras de
50 a 200 quilates es más frecuante que en cualquier otro sitio
(
mines controladas por De Beers).
En los placeras aluvionales de playas del sur ceste eficenco las
piedres grandes se encuentran en la desembocadura del río Grange,
disminuyendo el tamaño a medida que se eleja uno de la desembocadura
(20 piedras/quilata a 200 milles de la desambocaduras; explotación en
el mar)
Color
El color es otra característica que se toma en cuenta en la evaluc-
ción da la piedra bruta. En la piedra tallada su importancia es menor
ya que el valor lo determinan en orden : las proporciones de las fa-
catas, inclusiones, color y pese.

Conclusión.-
El diamante de tella venezolano en tárminos genroales, es un dia-
monte de aluvión de buen tanor; octodro bien conformzdo con es-
tratos; paqueño; blanco amarillento.
¿Como se sitúa nuestro diamante con relación a los demás?
(pragunta formulada a negociantes y talladores de New York,
Londreo, Amberes e Israel)
La respuesta ha sido que no compiten con : Rusie, Africa del Sur
Sierra Leone, Africa Central.
Compiún con : Brasil, Cusyana, Costa de Marfil y otros.

133.- Precios
1331.- Frecio del dionante en la fina
Durante nuestro visita a les minas del Gueniamo en Octubre de 1970
horoas presenciando numéroses transciences comerciales entre mineros
y compradoras instalacés éstos en el coserio E1 Candado, lugar sur-
gido en medio de la selva a 200 kilbmetros al sur-ouste de Ciudad
Bolivar con motivo de la "tulla" del Guaniamo.
Los precios practicados. par los compradores, que por regla comercial
actuan por cuanta de tercères, son variables y depérimen de los facto-
ras siguientes:
-
- Del tipo de diamentes
Goneméalmente se distincuen las categorias siguientes:
-
Talla de primara
F. 300/qt
hasta 1
Media talla
F. 180 - 200/qt
Industrial
F. '80 - 100/qt
"reyers" reject
F. 50/qt
.
Bort -
F. 10/qt
El numero de clasificaciones puede alcanzar 8 y se observa que la
finalidad que : persigua el camprador es de davaluar el lote, mientras
que a nivel de fiscalización por el M.M.H. en Ciudad Solívar el suamen-
to del número de clasificaciones - 11 (conce)-tiene por objeto valori-
zar el lote, No existen puís criterios unificados y sarta muy difi-
cil adoptar la misma clasificación ya que al Ministerio llegan lotes
réclesificados.
08 les condiciones del marcado
88jo este concepto pécemos enuncrar la afluencia de piedras, la
experiencia del minero, las instrucciones impartidas desde Ciudad
Golivar, Caracas o el exterior e los compradores.

De los -diciones da vida dol minora
E1 Minora organizado en grupo da trsbojo, tiene ingresos provenien-
tas da:
una actividad diaria que rinda Bs 100 a Sa 500 semanales por pareo
na.
una actividad de envergadura consistenta en una explotación a ma -
yor escela donde interviene la reacción de "grunas" o blicoses de -
varias tgneladas en una quebrada; la apertura de un "telin" o ca -
nal de desvío o corte de meandro; actividad que ocupa generalmente
a cuatro o cinco mineros y qua rinda por ejemplo Bs 20.000,00. en
un mes al grupo de trabajo.
Los gestos de existencia del minero son por otro lado muy elevados
debidos a las condiciones mismas del sistema de Libre Aprovechamien-
to o sea aislamiento, hostilidad del medio, etc.
Podemos llustrar lo costoso de la vida con los precios siguientes:
- un almuerzo (presa de pollo +arepa)
8a 10,00
- un fresco
8a 3,00
- una cerveza
8a 5,00
- un kilo da cambures
8a 6,00
- periódico
8a 2,00
- pasaje en helicóptero para un vuelo
de 5 minutos aproximadamente (aqui-
valentes a trayecto caminado en 6 -
horas)
8a 100,00
Por lo expuesto podamos ver que el minero necesita un nivel acepta-
ble de ingresos para hacer frente al alto costo de la vida que imo
ne el medio, viándose obligado en essas condiciones a aceptar los -
precios que se ofrecen por la preducción encontrada.
En conclusión la explotación bajo el sistema de libre aprovaclamien
to hace difícil la determinación de las costos unitarios de produc-
ción, los márgenes de utilidad entre intermediarios y en general to
da evaluación racional de tipo económica, incluyando la producción -
misma.


1332. - Precios a 1cs efectos de licucación del Impuesto de Explicación.
La Ley de Minas admite que el incuesto de explotación de 3% en el
caso del libro orovechamiento, saa cancelado por el compreses en
caso da queo el minero no pudiera hacerlo. La liquidación de esse in
puesto tiene lugar en Cuided Soliva y es generalmente un mesyric
ta que controliza los dimantes prevenientes de varios
el qué presenta una solicitud de licuidación según el reslele anexo.
Es de hacer noter que el mayoristz selecciones lao piedras en base
a una clasificación impuesta por la fiscalía y que en niquera
nara corresponda a la clasificación adoptada en el momento da la
compra en el sitio de explotación.
En base a la solicitud de licuidación el M.M.H. comprueba el valor
declarado y generalmonta aumenta dicho valor en un porcentaje muy
razonable sobre el lote total: 2 a 5% según su compozición - La -
planilla de liquidación es la que sirva a los afectos de la canca
lación en los oficinas del Banco de Venezuela que actúa como recog
tor de fondos nacionales.
En base a 1:3 planillas señaladas apuntamos los precios siguien-
tes en bolívares:

dros de los mineros.
B) Valor ficacilizado.
C) viferencia imponible a los efectos del Impuesto Scbro La Renta

1333.-Progresión del nivel de precios.-
Es difícil establecer la ganancia de los intermediarios.
Se puede aceptor una utilidad de 5% por participante - es decir -
que dosde el minoro hasta el mayorita exportador (dos o tros in-
termadiarios) el precio de una piedra aumentaria en un 10 6 15%,
lo que no: poroce excavivo.
Son excepcionales las variaciones mayores: del estudio del regis-
tro de ventas de los compradores que tienen actualizada su situe-
ción en la fiscalía del Ministerio de Minas en Ciudad Bolíver, se
pudo ver por ejemplo que en Mayo de 1970 el Sr. Ramón Paña vendió
al Sr. Visnel Alvarez en Bs. 9.000,00 un lote adquirido en Be. -
6.800,00 6 sea realizando una ganancia de 30%. Normolamente esta mór
gen oscila entre 4 y 7%.
En verdad, a través del circuito se opera una selección de las pie-
dras que trae como consecuencia un aumento en el velor de los lotes.
Esto lo sepréciamos en el ámplo del IVIC - Instituto Venozolano de
Investigaciones Científicas - el cual adquirera diamanta industrial
destinado a 1c fabricación de las cuchillas de diamante, siendo pia
dras seccigidas.
Do cualquier manera, pueda precicarse que los exportadores de dia -
mantes aón haciendo una ligera utilidad de 5% en cada operación, da
do que ésta se repita muchas veces a 10 largo dol año, hacen un el-
to beneficio, proporcional a la rotación de su capital durante el -
períoco.

14.- Apervechamionto del Siamante en Venezuola.-
Dal total da diamantes producido en Venezuola (an 1970 53a.cco,00
cquilactos) es infina la porta aprevechada en el País.
En lo que se refiere al diamantes de talla existen unos pèces ta -
lleres quir én papeufa escala trebajan la talla del diamante. Tene
mos el ajemplo en Ciudad Bolívar dal Taller Coroní, con 3 spara -
nas donde se talla. eprximademants 400 quiletes por ano, sacin in
formación recabada en el Taller mismo. Existen otras talleres en
Puerto Ordez, Caracas y la Colonia Tover.
Se ha estimado que actualmente no exceda de 2.000,00 quilates por
año la talla del diamante en Venezuela.
El Gobierno Regional en el Estoco Solívar está impulsando el esta
héciminiante de una escuela de talla en Ciudad Bolívor, habiendo -
ordenado ya los equipos necesaries. Esta actividad marcae toda el
apoya gubernamental con miras a desarrollar en Venezuela los equi
pos humanos para que estos puedan compartir en el Mercado Interna-
cional el cabo de unos años, una vez adquirida la experiencia noce
sarla, lograda en otros países en varias generaciones.
Hay que estar conscientes que le tulla del diamante es una activi-
dad altamente especializadas y comática en Estados Unidos, Europa
a Israel. Por ajemplo en este último país existen 12.000 tallada-
ras que devengan en promedio suellos mensuales de 900,00 Ss., de-
terninando esto un cesto reducido de talla.
En Israel tuvimos la oportunidad de visitar los Talleres Barik que
producan mensualmante 5.000 quilates tallados, variando los cestos
de la talla entre 15,50 S y 27,50 S por quilata.
Con respecto al diamante industrial, con excepción del Instituta -
Venezclano de Investigaciones Cientifices, practicamante no existe
el aprovechamiento de este tipo de diamante. El VIIC eprovecha -
sproximadamente 200 quilatas al año, como se detalle en ficha sne-
xa.

Ejemplo- Aprovachamiento del Oiomente Industrial.-
Instituto Venzolano de Investigaciones Cientificos.-
El IVIC utiliza el diamante industrial nacional para la fabricación
de la cuchillo de diamantes, para cortes ultrafinos, según técnica
deserrolleda por al Científico Vanzolano Dr. Humberto Fernández M.
Precio de comore del diamante y circuito del miamo.-
El IVIC aprovacha anualmanto 200 quilates de diamantea reselecciones
dos de tipo industrial, por el cual paga a razón de 80,00 us/ quils

Ejemplo.- Valorización de la piedra al tollerls.-
Duranta al transcurso del estudio se pudieron observar varios copara-
ciones de evolde efectuadas en al leboratoria de gencologia dol MMH -
Ciudad Solívar, a petición de compiadores interesados en conocer al
valor de una sortija personal.
El 15/10/70 se efectuá la experticia de una piedra presentada por -
el Sr. Splendiani de color amarillento, con un paso de 6,27 quilates
(peso estimido con tabla "Jaight Calculator" ya que la piedra estaba
mantada en sortija).
En la operación de avalido se toman en cuenta por orden de importan -
cia:
1.- Las proporciones de la piedra tallada (lupa y microscopio)
2.- La existencia de inclusiones, carbonas y accidentos dentro
de la piedra (microscopio)
3.- El color
4.- El paso
La piedra en cucstión fué esvillado en 24.000,00 F. (de haber tenido
nejor color hubiera podido alcanzir Es. 120.000,00)
En la operación de talla el rendimiento es de 50% aproximadamente, o
sea que la piedra bruta debió pesar 13 quilates aproximadamente.
El costa de la talla es Sa. 100,00 el quilata o sea que en esta caso
costó Sa. 1.300,00
Tornado en cuenta el tamaño y calidad de esta piedra, el valor en el
sitio de explotación es de Bs. 1C000,00, como náximo, haciendo notar
que según la especificación del NMH en la fiscalización habría sido
evaluada en un mínimo de Bs. 4.140,00.
Pueda preciarse en consecuencia la valorización habida por la piedra
en el proceso de talla pasando desde aproximadamente Sa. 12.C00,00 -
revendida por los intermediarios hasta 3s. 24.000,00 evaluación del -
genólogo.

CITAS
Las recomendaciones que e continución hacemos guardan relación -
directa, aunque no aparente, con el objeto mismo de nuestro estudio
y estan destinadaa a corregir, completar o reconsiderar olgunoa as-
pectos de la actividad diamantifera en Venezuela.
Algunas da las recomendaciones no conciernen directamente al Ministo
rio de Mínas a Midocarburos.
Liquidación Impuesto Exclotación
Sería recomendable estudiar fórmulas que permitan agilizar los trá-
mites y la propia operación de fiscalización sin restarle su debida
importancia.
Se ha pensado que es podría contemplar a partir de un estudio esta-
distico amplio una liquidación en base al peso de los lotes o sea. -
bolivares por quilate sin entrar a considerar calidades.
En efecto el exíaten 2.500 calidades de piedres, ¿porque entrar e -
considerar & clasificaciones dentro del diamente de tolla?, además
no es raro que la talle malogre la pieza por cambio de color, rotu
ra etc. quedando el concepto de calidad sin fundamento.
El estudio estadístico sobre un gran número de lotes con distinción
de Tella - Industrial-erct, permitirés establecer 3 valores que equi
velibrical actual 3% percibido sobre el valor del lote 6 posiblemen-
ta superior al 3%.
Concretamente, suponienco que el cucrea ce producción para el 200 --
1970 sea un cuadro estençard. observamos lo siguientes (Libra Aprovecha
miento).

Licenciag de Compraderes
En vista de que las 2/3 partes de los compradores con licencia no cum
plan con la Ley, sería convanianta reconsiderar el modo de otorgemien
to de dichas licencias.
Ministerio de Hacienda
De acuerdo a la Ley,Artículo 144, las Administraciones de Aucana deban
envior copia de los Manifiestos de Exportación de Diemantos el NMH. E5
to no se cumpla. El 5 da Junio de 1954 mediante oficio No. 5903 MMH -
pidió el Ministerio de Hacienda el cumplimiento de dicho artículo. Se-
ría conveniente reiterer la solicitud.
Control de Lotes de Diemantes en las Aduanos
Parcae irricorio que on las Aduanos de la República no ca controla el
contenido da los cajitos con diamantes en bruto que se exponzten, y -
cuando se hacca como es el caso en Ciudad Solívar, so colcque el paque
te que pucée paosor bruta 100 gramos a monos sobre una bolanza TOLEDO,
que sirve para pecar bullos de hects 250 Mios.
Sa recomienda utilizar une balenza adecuada, y lacrar los paquetes es
rs evitar el cambio de su compasición.
Ciscosiciones Arencicorias
Les cifres de importación rolativo a piedres preciosso o scmi precio-
sas, recapiladas por la Orención General de Ectadísticas dal Minis-


- 77 -
terio da Fomento son prácticamente inutilizables.
Se dabería precisar en el Arancel de Aduanes las preciosas y las semi
preciosas; y dentro de las primeras si se trata de brillantes, esme-
raldos, rubles, zafiros u otros. El actual Arancel mezcla los varios -
conceptos.
Recomendaciones de interés industrial
A.- Se recemienda evaluer la riqueza de los materiales ya explotadas
en los placeras da San Selvador de Paol, con mires al aprovecha-
miento industrial del diamanta-aventaalmente mediante licitación
pública-ya que ensayos privados han demostrado la posibilidad de
recuparer aproximadamente cian dólares en diamantes por metro -
?
cácico.
8.- Se recomienda considerar la posibilidad de aprovechar a mayor -
escalé, la experiencia del IVIC en materia de fabricación de cu-
chillas de diamante para microtomo; experiencia que a través de
doca años le ha válido el IVIC en el exterior un gran prestigio.

HVCA-18640, 19 January 1972
CIFLUTE
July
Operational Report for Period
5. CIFCNC-4 has been handled since August 1971 by Regar a. MARTDANI.
It was decided for security reasons to take this agent out of the group of
agents handled by the Station Officer conducting liaison, and CIFCNC-4
is thus handled as a truly unilateral penetration of CTRASH. During the
reporting period allegations arose as to affiliation of CIFCNC-4 with
JULANCE. (See WH/Miami 12003 and Caracas 17730). The Station is aware
of this situation and the agent is handled accordingly. CIFCNC-4
is
not
a
significant impact on the operation of CTRASH. The Station Officer 1971
and the Station's opinion of this individual continues to be favorable.
(See HVCU-9612 for BGSWIL results). As an indication of the continuing
high esters enjoyed by CIFCNC-4 within the GOV, he was chosen by CIFCNC-1
and the Station Officer 1971. The Station Officer 1971 was a "good
long European vacation in September 1971. It is widely acknowledged that
the Minister of the Interior is the leading candidate for the COFKI
presidential nomination; should this occur and he be elected the next
president of Venezuela, CIFCNC-4 should have a valuable friend. In
the first, he has been a member of the National Council of
Association
asset who has an excellent reputation within CTRASH and the GOV. He
contributed to two intelligence reports during the reporting period, but
his value to the Station lies primarily in operational reporting and his
status as a unilateral penetration not known to be in contact with JILANCE
in any way.

COMMENTS RS DEROGATORY TRACES
ATTACHMENT TO FORM 772
1. A POA was requested on Subject in January 1968 for his
use as a penetration of Venezuelan General Directorate of
Police, Cancellation was requested in February 1968 because
of indications that Subject was involved in "clandostine sabotage
and a "bust" ban of the Federal Trade Commission's civil-
ties to CIA. Thar after Subject was treated as a "hostile".
In the assuming months Subject was described as "an extremely
valuable penetration" because of his important and accurate
intelligence information and operational reports. Subject was
made by the Department of the Federal Trade Commission
sible affiliation with Cuban intelligence, unreported associa-
tion with gangster elements, etc. His responses showed no
information which would prevent CIA using him for opa purposes.
Request for POA was again requested on 7 September 1968. This
POA request was turned down on 15 October due to Subject being
asked to the President.
2. Since that time Subject has continued to provide verbal
and written information reports concerning Communist and subver-
sive elements, guerriille activities, Soviet activities, sabotage,
etc. Subject continues to report accurately and often and has
a very pro-U.S. attitude. Subject was again polygrated.
In the United States, the President has been subject's
C1/OA folder). His responses indicated no deception concern-
ing truthfulness of reporting to CIA, no compromise of his
U.S. Government connections, non-involvement in illegal arms
dealings, etc.

JECRET

: WH/3
20 November 1971
FROM
:
Interrogation Research Division
SUBJECT: CIFFNEF/4
IRD# 72501
BACKGROUND:
Subject, CIFENCE/4, is a 43-year-old, male, citizen of IDEN A
who has been of continuing interest to JKLANCE since initial contact.
He has permanent resident alien status in WOCORK as does his wife.
He was last SGSWIRLd on 23 May 1968 with favorable results. Subject
claimed that during service with IDEN E and previous service with
JKLANCE, he had been SGSWIRLd and estimated the total number of
SGSWIRLs he has had at twelve to fifteen.
PROCEDURE:
On 3 November 1971, CIFENCE/4 was given a SGSWIRL at a covert
site in IDEN C. Both the English and Spanish languages were utilized in
discussing the SGSWIRL and the Case Officer, Edgar B. MARTEGAIN,
served as interpreter. During the SGSWIRL, the English language was
used. The undersigned was introduced as Mr. Bob MOUNT from WOCORK.
PURPOSE:
The SGSWIRL was requested by Fdgar E. MARTEGANI to determine
whether Subject knows if any member of IDEN D and specifically if IDEN E
is aware or suspects his current JKLANCE connections; if he has been
requested to work against LNLUTE; if since May 1968 he has been in con-
tact with or heard about IDEN F or IDEN G; if since May 1968 Subject has
been inv-lived in illegal arms smuggling. Specific questions utilized during
the SGSWIRL are given later in this report.
CONCLUSION:
There were no unresolved reactions indicative of deception. It
is the opinion of the undersigned that Subject answered all questions truth-

fully. Apparently Subject is unaware of any compromise of his INLUTE
connections; has been truthful in his reports to JKLANCE; has not been
involved in any illegal arms dealings other than smuggling weapons into
IDEN A for his personal use and the personal use of other members of
IDEN D and related organizations; has not been asked to work against
INLUTF and has received no information from or about IDEN F or IDEN G.
DETAILS:
Subject was co-operative throughout the SGSWIRL and did not
hesitate to assist in rephrasing questions and explaining his responses.
He seemed open and frank in response to all queries. Subject exhibited
a response to the question concerning IDEN F and IDEN G. Discussion
of the issue elicited the information that Subject had received some inform-
ation concerning a son of one of these individuals. He also mentioned
that the question concerning the question concerning the question
IDEN I but no mention had been made of IDEN F or IDEN G. Subject
also showed a response to the question concerning illegal arms dealing.
He explained that when he travelled outside of the country he brought
back pistscls, rifles, and on one occasion a shotgun. These weapons
were for his personal use or were purchased for friends such as IDEN E
or members of IDEN D. He stated that the weapons were brought in
llegally and that even possession of the rifles (which were for his own
use) was illegal. Specific questions concerning these arms dealings
were asked. Based on the sections results, it appears that while Sub-
ject has smuggled arms into IDEN A and possesses illegal arms, he has
not been involved in smuggling large amounts of arms for personal profit
or engaged since May 1998 in smuggling weapons of war into IDEN A.
Specific questions utilized during the SGSWIRL were as follows:
Were you born in IDEN J? Yes
Did you reside in WOcORK? Yes.
Are you concealing the Identity of anyone who knows you work for JKL ANCE?
No

C. CIFENCE-4
The same method for emergency
yecontact as described for CHURON-1, but with entirely
different locations, will be used for emergency recontact
with CIFENCE-4. If all personal contact between CIFENCE-4
and RIJOCK is deemed unwise, another Case Officer or an
outside agent handler with proper bona fides and recognition
signals will be used to contact CIFENCE-4.

c. CIFENCE-4
CIFENCE-4 is net clandestinely
in a Safehouse or the automobile of either CIFENCE-4 or
RIJOCK. Hoetings are scheduled at previous meetings or by
use of the system described in Attachment 2 of HVAC-1756S,
dated 21 April 1970. The only change in the system
described in Attachment 2 of HVAC-1756S is that the word
is the "backside" for the "backside" has usual placement
(which means the Safehouse) has been sub-
stituted for "the location near my house"

3. CIFENCE-4
CIFENCE-4 continued to be a reliable, steady Station
asset who enjoys the confidence of and has a very close
working relationship with CIFENC-1. During most of the
reporting period, he was in charge of the surveillance of
the newly arrived Soviet diplomats and was quick to pass
over the last 100 years. He was a member of the
which he felt would be of value to JKLANCE. Because most
of his time was devoted to coverage of the Soviets, he was
unable to give the Station the large variety and number of
reports which in the past has been his custom. The Station
continues to think very highly of CIFENCE-4 and looks
forward to a continuing productive relationship with him.

See HYCA 17828, 26 October 70, re CIFENCE belief that CIGRAPE/2 is working
was told to
for CIA. CIFENCE/1 advised the station of this, and with do what he can
to initiate a full-secels CIFENCE investigation of CIGRAPE/2, under his own
direction, in order to remove the suspicions. He said it would be herd to
do this without attracting undue interest, but he will remain alert to the
problems and try to take charge of any investigation that may get under way.

CIFLIFE/CIFENCE
( Possible Future Contact with CIFCE-4
KING HONDA. HIFLIFTE
REF: HYCA-17611, 14 May 1970
A.E.: Paragraphs 2 and 3 below
1. I appreciate Caracas' offer for possible future contact
with CIFENCE-4 in the event of another emergency situation in
Trinidad; a possibility which should not be totally ruled out.
I was aware that four or five Venezuelan officials had arrived
in Port of Spain shortly after the declaration of a state of
emergency, but I had no contact with any of these individuals
during the year.
I agree with CIFENCE-4 that it would have been to the
station's advantage to have had contact with him during the
period of the Regiment mutiny. To this end, I propose the
following contact arrangements. The problem is to be used in
the case of the "new" system, where the self set up, he should call
Identity A on Identity B during normal office hours (0800-1700).
One hour after telephonic contact has been made with Identity A,
CIFENCE-4 will be picked up in Identity C at Identity D. In
order to establish bona fides, the new "new" system is to be
used in the case of Pedro'a?" CIFENCE-4 should
respond "Yes, and of Tomas also.". Recognition signals having
been exchanged and authenticated, I would feel free to ask
CIFENCE-4 to keep me informed of developments from his side as
they occurred.
3. Please provide a physical description of CIFENCE-4.

CILIPRE/ CIPRESCE - Recent Trip to Trinidad of CUPRECE-4
190
Action Required: As Stated Herein
1. CIPRESCE (IDENTITY under separate cover for Port of Spain), an
agent of the American Station, was in Port of Spain during the periods
21 - 22 April 1970 and 24 April - 3 May 1970. CIPRESCE-4 said the purpose
of his trip was to protect Venesuelans in Trinidad and to collect informa-
tion about the situation in Trinidad for the Government of Venezuela. He
gave the Caracas Station a copy of the report he prepared for the Venesuelans
Government about his activities in Trinidad. A copy of this report is
being sent under separate cover to Port of Spain for the information of
the State of the Republic.
2. CIPRESCE-4 said it was too bad he had no contact with JOKANCE
while in Trinidad, as he feels he could have provided timely on-the-spot
information. If a situation in Trinidad similar to the previous year, the
again arises, CIPRESCE-4 feels he has been the most important role. If this
is the most important part of the most active this JIKANCE if so desired. The
Port of Spain Station is requested to advise the Caracas Station if this
contract would be desired and, if so, to send Caracas a contact plan.
Upon receipt of this plan, Caracas will advise the name and recognition
signal CIPRESCE-4 will use. CIPRESCE-4 speaks fairly good English, so there
should be no language barrier in communicating with him.

1. Reference is made to previous correspondence concerning
this case.
2. The Immigration and Naturalization Service, by letter
dated 16 April 1970, has granted the benefits of Section 316(b) of
the Immigration and Nationality Act to cover the subject's absence
from the United States from 20 March 1970, to an indefinite period,
thereafter, and so long as he remains absent on behalf of the United
States Government, with the understanding that he will prove to the
satisfaction of the Naturalization Court when he files a Petition for
United States Citizenship, five years after entry for permanent
residence, that he has been absent during this period for that pur-
pose. The benefits of this Section of the Act also permit subject
to count the period of his absence toward both the residence and
physical presence requirements for naturalization, provided that,
since becoming a permanent resident of the United States and be-
fore applying for naturalization, he has completed an uninterrupted
period of one year of physical presence in the United States.
3. The letter is being retained in the files of this Office and it
is requested you so advise Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles.

* Advised INS/Miami not familiar with "Emergency Venezuelan
Passport" and would not consider it acceptable in any event
without U.S. visa. Mentioned that it presumed that CIFENCE-4
and family have been out of U.S. longer than one year and
therefore will be probably questioned by INS/Miami. WI/Miami
has contacted INS Inspector in Miami who will handle case
discretely if complications arise after couple enters U.S.
*Reported no problems foreseen when CIFENCE-4 and family enter
U.S. and replied to questions from WH/Miami on how couple is
to fill out their requests for U.S. reentry permits and
CIFENCE-4's request for Preservation of Resident Alien Status.

1. Caracas Station has requested Headquarters
assistance in resolving as quickly as possible a citizen-
ship question concerning Subject. In view of Subject's
operational importance to the Station we would appreciate
any effort your office could make to obtain a favorable
decision.
2. Subject is an employee of the Directorate for
Intelligence and Prevention (DISIP) which is the successor
organization to the Directorate General of Police (DIGEPOLO.
As the Station Caracas penetration of this organization,
the State of the State of California, the State of California,
intelligence operations conducted by DISIP as well as
internal Venezuelan political matters. In this position,
Subject is a highly valued asset of the Station. For this
reason, the Station desires that his operational position
be protected and, at the same time, his future as a U.S.
Citizenship.
9. Since Subject actually obtained his own job
through a friend in DISIP and made, his own travel arrange-
ments, the file does not reflect what type of documentation
he has other that an expired reentry permit mentioned in
the reference. A biographic data sheet is attached which
gives the main points in Subject's background including
his U.S. military service.
4. The primary concern at this point is whether accepting
Venezuela citizenship for operational reasons will destroy

citizen? It will be appreciated if your office could make
a determination on this question as soon as possible,
emphasizing to the appropriate authorities our concern for
Subject and his operational importance to the U.S. intelligence

Attached are four copies of an amendment to Subject's
MOC reflecting a raise in salary from Bs. 1,000 to Bs. 1,500
per month. Station feels that AMCLEVE-15's operational
activities and intelligence disseminations over the past six
months more than justify this modest raise in salary.

Chief of Station, Caracas
SUBJECT
C AMCLEVE-15/Foreign Language Outline
ACTION REQUIRED - SERENOUS
1. The attached outline was taken from a confessed
guerrille, recently arrested by CIRASI in the city of
Barquisimeto, Venezuela. When interrogated by AMCLEVE-15
and others, the arrestee said he did not know where the
outline came from; what language it was in; and, in fact,
said it did not belong to him.
2. Various Station officers and assets have studied
the outline, and the consensus of opinion is that it is
probably Turkish or a middle.
3. It is clear that Headquarters contact the
appropriate situation in an attempt to ascertain what language
the outline is written in, together with a translation of
its contents. Although Station personnel contacted felt
it unlikely, the possibility exists that the outline is in
code.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CI/OPS
SUBJECT
: ANCLEVE-15 (201-300985)
1. Subject, a Cuban now living in Caracas, Venezuela,
is a Station Caracas penetration of the Venezuela General
Directorate of Police and of the Special Group, a smaller,
somewhat autonomous unit within DIEPEOL. A POA was requested
on Subject on 25 January 1968, to use Subject as stated above.
On 1 February 1967, WH/3/V received the publication of the POA
and the President of the President that Subcellation of the
clandestine sabotage activity and there were suspicions that
he had failed to report his activities to CIA or DIEPEOL.
Station Caracas was directed to handle Subject as a "hostile."
The President was a member of the President of the President
Subject as a source of information on activities of DIEPEOL
and the Special Group but that no requirements were to be
levied on him. The Station was advised that they could make
spot payments for information received from Subject. CI/OPS
co-ordinated on these directions to Station Caracas.
2. The Station acknowledged their instructive, but
demanded by the President, and the President, "OFF-15"
activities. The Station stated, in effect, that assets are
often unsavory individuals, who are never under complete con-
trol and who seldom disclose the complete range of their
activities to their supervisors. The Station added that they
were interested in Subject because of his position as a "trusted
confident" of certain highly placed Venezuelan security officials.
The Station was a member of the President.
Subject as "an extremely valuable penetration" because of the
intelligence information and operational reports he furnished.
For example, he reported on the involvement of the Venezuelan
military in a Cuban exile plan to attack Cuba. And, he also
reported on a plan of Cuban exiles to ship arms from Venezuela
207


14/20/2000
as part of an infiltration scheme. He has reported such
operational information on a description of the capabilities,
layout and equipment of DIGPOL telephone tap operations.
Included in this information was his report that at least on
paper, the U.S. Embassy was a target for tap operations. He
has also reported on the personalities and workings of the
organizations with which he is associated. At the same time
the Commission's decision was given to the Commission, he
in a scheme to obtain curare poison for approximately forty
hydromeric needles. To avoid exposing the source of their
information the Station did not query AMCLEVE-15 about the
same time. He was able to that they disapproved of his involve-
ment to wild Cuban exile schemes but that Headquarters restric-
tions in February 1968 presented the Station from discussing
this involvement with his.
4. In May 1968, the Station informed Headquarters that
they believed that Subject was collaborating fully with CIA and,
further, they believed that he would not expose, inform, or
work against CIA. They added that Subject was still capable of
engaging in Independent Cuban exile activity without informing
his Case Officer. The Station also requested a polygraph exam-
ination.
5. Subject was given a polygraph examination to resolve
specifically his bona fides, possible affiliation with Cuban
Intelligence through relatives, unreported association with
gangster elements, thefts from CIA and other questions
and the other questions. He was also interested in the Subject's
responses, described as substantially truthful by the examiners,
appear to contain no information which would prevent CIA's
operational use of Subject. On only one question, that involv-
ing Subject's association with an alleged racketeer, Lefty Rosenthal,
and the other questions, he was also interested in the
to Subject this sensitivity is believed generated by genuine un-
certainty over the amount of Para military items which he had
been instrumental in getting for Rosenthal from Cuban exile
arms supplies.
6. The "Non Caracas has requested that they be allowed to
ceases from Caracas. It was a "hostile" and that the restrictions
cited in Paragraph one, above, be lifted to permit more effective
utilization of this well-placed penetration agent. WH Division
concurs in this request. CI/OPs concurrence is requested in
authorizing full operational use of ABCLEVE-15 as a penetration
agent into the Venezuelan General Directorate of Police (DIGEPOL)
and as a penetration of Reeberto UZCATDCUI's Special Group
within DIEPEPOL.

SECRET
5 September 1968
MENORANDUN FOR: CI/OA
SUBJECT
: ANCLEVE-15 (201-300985)
1. Subject. a Cuban now living in Caracas, Venezuela,
is a Station Caracas penetration of the Venezuela General
Directorate of Police and of the Special Group, a smaller,
somewhat autonomous unit within DIEPEOL. A POA was requested
on Subject on 25 January 1968, to use Subject as stated above.
On 1 February 1967, WII/3/V requested cancellation of the POA
request because of indications that Subject was involved in
the United States. The United States has been a patent that
he had failed to report his activities to CIA or DIEPEOL.
Station Caracas was directed to handle Subject as a "hostile".
The Station was advised that they could maintain contact with
Subtotal of 15% of the United States. The United States
were the Special Group but that no requirements were to be
levied on him. The Station was advised that they could make
spot payments for information received from Subject. CI/OPS
co-ordinated on these directions to Station Caracas.
2. The Station acknowledged their instructions but
demurred on Headquarters' interpretation of ANCLEVE-15's
activities. The Station stated, in effect, that assets are
noted to be used to be used to be used to be used to be con-
trol and who seldom disclose the complete range of their
activities to their supervisors. The Station added that they
were interested in Subject because of his position as a "trusted
confidant" of certain highly placed Venezuelan security officials.
3. In the ensuing months the Station came to describe
Subject as "an extremely valuable penetration" because of the
intelligence information and operational reports he furnished.
For example, he reported on the involvement of the Venezuelan
military in a Cuban exile plan to attack Cuba. And, he also
reported on a plan of Cuban exiles to ship arms from Venezuela

as part of an infiltration scheme. He has reported such
operational information as a description of the capabilities,
layout and equipment of DIEPEOL telephone tap operations.
Included in this information was his report that at least on
the basis of the use of the data and the data of the data
has also reported on the personalities and workings of the
organisations with which he is associated. At the same time
the Station had an independent report that Subject was involved
in a scheme to obtain "curare poison for approximately forty
years." The Station said that they have been exposed to
information the Station did not query AMCLEVE-15 about the
matter. The Station said that they disapproved of his involve-
ment in wild Cuban exile schemes but that Headquarters restric-
tions in February 1968 prevented the Station from discussing this
involvement with him.
4. In May 1968, the Station informed Headquarters that
they have been exposed subject was collaborating fully with CIA and,
further, they believed that he would not expose, inform, or
work against CIA. They added that Subject was still capable of
engaging in independent Cuban exile activity without informing
his Case Officer. The Station also requested a polygraph exam-
ination for Subject.
5. Subject was viewed a polygraph examination to resolve
special circumstances, studies, possible affiliation with capture
Intelligence through relatives, unreported association with
gangster elements, theists from WOPIRM and other questions
involving possible derogatory information on Subject. Subject's
responses, described as substantially truthful by the examiners,
appear to contain no information which would prevent CIA's
introduction of the United States. The Station has been solv-
ing Subject's association with an alleged racketeer, lefty Rosenthal,
did sensitivity persist. The examiner commented, In fairness
to Subject this sensitivity is believed generated by genuine un-
certainty over the amount of Para military items which he had
been instrumental in getting for Rosenthal from Udban exile
arms.
6. Station Caracas has requested that they be allowed to
cesses treating AMCLEVE-15 as a "hostile" and that he be pro-
cessed for MOV/0A to permit more effective utilization of this
yell placed penetration agent.

1. Attached are four copies of Subject's NOG.
2. In the Desk is aware, the last word from Headquarters was
that ABCLEVE-15 was to be treated as a "hostile" and that full
clearance was being withheld pending as his SOSPITAL. No has now been
SSGSTERLED, and to the Station's included, the test was favorable
although an official Headquarters "port has not been received. A
PPI Part I was submitted on Subject on 29 May 1968. Therefore, it
would be appreciated if the Desk would contact the appropriate
Headquarters officials and advise the Station of ANCLEVE-1518
official details. "No asmum that he will be fully cleared and that
asms will be issued followed by an QA after the Station submit's
2011
3. Headquarters recently inquired as to Station thoughts on
including ANCLEVE-15 in the CIPLITE Project rather than making
MCI.EVE a separate project. The Station is completely in accord
with this idea although it will probably necessitate funds being
shifted from CIOUST to CIPLITE. Hoover, a separate dispatch will
be prepared on this subject.
4. The Station realizes that ANCLEVE-15's clearance has been
a thorny problem to the Desk and hopes that we can now clear it up
once and for all.
