Director

Attention: Mr. S. J. Papich
FROM
:
Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECTO Lyle STUART
Reference is made to your memorandum dated 1 June 1964,
in which you provided this office with several questions you
wished to have passed to liss Viola June COBB regarding
Lyle STUART. There follows the information provided by
the
1. Regarding Lyle STUART, Juan Jose ANELVALO, and
Anticonunisgo en America Latina:
Early in the spring of 1962, in Exkiro, ANEVALO told
me that STUART was prodding him about getting another of his
books translated, to take advantage of the publicity around
The Shark and the Saradines. I am not interested in
speaking terms with the new, therefore declined to have
an important role in the with him. About three months later,
ANEVALO told me that STUART was going to publish
Anticonunismo en America Latinis and that the American
student, married to a Mexican, American, American American
(who had written to the American Uncontemporano, published
the
1962, financed by Alas Adical Revolucionario
de El Salvador) was doing the translation into English.
Early in 1963, ANEVALO told me that the transition hand't
been satisfactory and therefore STUART had obtained a re-
translation, by Charleton BELAS.
When STUART was here in Mexico in June, he told
Dr. OSMOUEZA that he was very happy about the way the book
was selling.
Inasmuch as STUART has paid ARXVALO only 10 per cent
of monoye received by STUART on the Chark and the Saradines
gales (in contrast with some book contracts in which the author
receives 10 per cent of the money represented by number of
copies paid untotalized by the retail sales price) I would
assume he is no more generous with Antimonismo.

I know of no affiliations of STCART with foreign
political parties of government. His attempts to get close
to Fidel CASTRO in 1960 were motivated by a desire to exploit
the journalistic advantage of the American American original
public relations. He said, he Sardines was apparently
motivated by money-making interests and by the hope that
he might spark a sensation - excitly what he did manage to
do with his outrageous advertising. He seemed to calculate
that there might be libel suits possible against the firms
and the newspapers he could provoke to attack his
The original contract of ARFVAL. STUART
was
superseded by another in November 1960, a granting STUART
and the President of the American foreign language editions
of The Shark and the Sardines and, I believe, established
that

Information about STUART's dealings with ARFVAL
and whatever others, could be obtained (with guile) from
Zileen BRANT, who had to be at the time of the first
time, was a new idea. She subsequently broke with him
because of deep and bitter resentment against him, then
returned not too long ago to collaborate with him. She is
his wife's sister. She is certainly working to get the
only because he was a very successful, but the other pay. For
the house changed her mind about him would be almost
impossible, I believe, in view of the long history of incidents
that had brought her to have contempt for him, at the time
I knew her in 1961. She said, he was a very good
opportunity to get the attention from her, it would be absolutely
necessary to approach her from some angle that would give
no hint of government investigation. She is very gregarious.
She is a fortyish medium-attracting, but he was a very
successful in the way he was a very good since I knew her). If
contacted by somebody she would assume to be a writer, and
who would be a bit friendly with her and see her off-bours,
she would probably talk freely about some of the things
quite important. She was a very good research. He has
quiet in mind in case she is contacted. SIEK BAS A VERY
DEEP AND LONGTIME NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD ALL GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES INVOLVED IN INVESTIGATION. She was active in
liberal activities in Chicago, and if I remember correctly,
although she is certainly not communist, she considered herself
a little jeopardised by the BC Carby period.
Angela Delli BANTZ-ARROCHE could also be contacted,
of course.

2. Begrading Lyle STUART, Dr. Baul CORCUEEDA, Bertolome
COSTA Amic, and Mario HONTTEOPATE Toledo:
Dr. OZEGUIDA apparently has had a secret longing to
get something of his own printed in English. He seized upon
the opportunity of commenting GERALD G. G. G. G. G. G.
Antikousnizos in order to write the STUART this spring.
STUART wrote very cordially bane to OSERUEDA, hoping to meet
him on a trip to Mexico in the New York City.
me his correspondence to STUART, he sought to make me see
it as an attempt to speak with STUART about the royalties
STUART has been paid me.
When Dr. OZEGUIDA finally did see ETUART here in
Mexico during the book conference in June, he only very
timidly and very, very brief, to study the outched upon the royalty
of
and indeed went to a great deal of trouble to serve
the
for the
BRETFEOTTE Toledo. (STUART had expressed interest in
getting in touch with some public and writers.) OSENGUDA
bunted about, taking Congress and MONTFORTE Toledo to lunch
with a special meeting to get the MONTFORTE Toledo to
11.1995 STUART to dinner at their apartment. There were
12.1995 STUART to dinner at their apartment in the distribution of
13.1995 STUART to dinner at the 11.1995 STUART.

However, both COSTA Amic and the HOMFERTOATE Toledo
told me that they found STUART offewely vulgar and were not
at all enthusiastic about having anything to do with him.
To weeks ago, OSEGUDRA sketched the outline of a
pook (contemporary history of U.S. and Latin American relations )
he hopes STUART will want to publish, and sent the outline
up to him.

LITIE STRART
ARXALO
"ATTIKOMATISMO EN AMERICA LATIRA"
Early in the spring of 1962, here in Mexico, Arvalo told me that Stuart
was prodding him about getting another of his books translated, to take au-
vantage of the publicity around "The Chark and the Sarcinates", I was already
far beyond speaking terms with Stuart and the President to have anything
further to do with the most of the months later, Arvalo told me that Stuart
was a public "Antikomimico en America Latina" and that a young American
student, married to a Mexican, Asgela dell. Sente Arrocha (vio had written
"Arevalo, Fensador Contemporaeo') was doing the translation into English.
Parly in 1963, Arvalo told me that the translation hadn't been satisfactory
and therefore Stuart had ordained a re-translation, by Charleston Della.
:
When Stuart was here in Mexico in June, he told Dr. Oscedaas that he was
very happy about the vey the book was selling.
Inasmuch as Stuart has paid Arvalo only 10 percent of moseys received by
Stuart on "The Sart and the Sarcinates" sales (in contrast with some book con-
tracts in which the author receives its own product. The money represented by
number of copies told me that the partial sales price) I would assume he
is no more generous with the Antikomimico". I can ask the Oegueda the exact
terms of the American table to see Osegueda this week.
I now of no affiliations of Stuart with foreign political parties of
government. His attempts to get close to Fidel Castro in 1960 were motivated
by a desire to explicit the journalistic advantages of an interview. His
original interest in "The Short and the Gardens" was apparently motivated by
money-making interes: and by the hope that he might septa a sensation - exactly
what he did manage to do with his outrageous advertising. He seemed to calcu-
late that there might be little gift to possible against the firms and the new-
papers, but he said.
I am sure you have it on file, but I will enclose a copy of Arevalo's
original contract with Stuart. It was superceded by another in November of
1961, granting Stuart certain rights with regard to other foreign language
editions of "The Stark and the Findings" and, I believe, establishing that
Stuart should have first option of other Arevalo books translated into English.
Information about Stuart's dealings with Arvalo and whatever others could
be obtained WITH GULLF from Eileen Brent, who was his editor at the time of the
Published by Coste Amic, 1952. Financed by Als Radical Revolucionario de El
Salvador.

first contact with Arevalo, subsequently broke with him because of deep and
bitter attention against his, then returned not too long ago to collaborate
on him. She is his wife's sister. She is certainly working with him now
only because he finally offered her a little bette pay. For her to have
changed her mind about him would be almost impossible, I believed that of
the long history of incidents that had broken down the report for him,
at the time I knew her in his eyes, she was his operation inside-out. In order
to
make the problem of her, it would be absolutely necessary to approach her
from some angle that would give no hint of government investigation. She is
very
gregarious. She is a fortyish medium-structive, looking for a good way to
vory gregarious. She is a fortyish medium-structive, long way to
voman (unless her status has been the same) but it is very smooth. By somebody she would
assume to be able to know would be a bit friendly with her and see her
 carefully. She would probably talk freely about Stuart. But she is quite clever
and rather worldly in some respects, so that must be kept in mind. I would
is contacted. She HAS A VERY DEEP AND LONGSTING HEARTLY ADVERTISING. I INVORAD ALL
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES INVOLVED IN INVESTIGATION. She was actively in liberal
activities in LUCACAO, AMA
not committe, she considered herself a little jeopardized by the Mc Carthy
period.
Angela Del'i Sante-Arroche could be contacted, too, of course. I will
look for her address at Costa Auci's office and pass it along.

June 6, 1964
Lyle Stuart
Dr. Paul Osegueda
Bartolome Costa Amc
Mario Monteforte Toledo
Dr. Osegueda apparently has had a secret longing to get something of his
own printed in English. He seized upon the opportunity of commenting Beals'
introduction to "Antikommienom" in order to strive to Stuart this spring. Stuart
wrote very cordially back to Osegueda, hoping to meet him on a trip to Mexico
in June. When Osegueda confessed to ze his correspondence with Stuart, he
sought to make me see it as an attempt to speak with Stuart about the royalties
Stuart has never paid me.
When Osegueda finally did see Stuart here during the book congress in June,
he only very timidly very, very briefly touched upon the royalty problem, and
the most important, and deal of trouble to serve Stuart by introducing him to
Costa Amc and to Mario Monteforte Toledo. (Stuart had expressed interest in
getting in touch with some publishers and writers.) Osegueda, who was a
taking Osegueda and Monteforte Toledo to lunch with Stuart, even managed to get
the Monteforte Toledo to invite Stuart to dinner as their apartment. There
were tentative discussions of collaborating in the distribution of Costa Amic
books in the United States and of publishing some book of Monteforte Toledo's.
However, both Costa Amc and the Monteforte Toledo told me that they
found Stuart offensively vulgar and were not at all enthusiastic about having
anything to do with him.
Two weeks ago, Osegueda stretched the outline of a book (contemporary history
of U.S. and Latin American relations) he hopes Stuart will want to publish, and
sent the outline up to him.

SUBJECT
Operational/Pro.ress Repor: for Project LIMILUCF for April and May, 1964
ACTION REFERENCE
1. Forwarder herewith in a process report for Procet LIMILUCK for
the period specified. This report was prepared by Leo C. HEDLICH, the
outside case office.
2. LIMILUCK/1 has provided information for operational purposes on
a
number oi subjecis and/or individuals in which the Sa:ion has an in-
terest or some sort of requirement from other (i.e., Paris Inbuctore's
Sémau). Also, un seus, a of papers all of major Alcisco preen
in the 1962. The case follows, as the time of their C.-
volt effort in 1962. has a PHILIBRAIRE has gone through the papers and
has had about 170 frames analysis will be recorred to brand-
gare-ers.
5. The aferal between LIMILUCK/1 and LIPCOOKY/ is, temporarily a:
test, suspended. Undoubtedly, the return of LIMILUCK/1's life had a good
deat to do with this plus the'sot that. pressure was being put on the two
pand, and the 1962. The data was obtained by the 1962. The
manently is difficult to say, but LIMILUCK/1 has been put on notice chas
he is gain, to be subject to penalty 15. inat'. Outside of that, LIM-
LOCK/1 has been quite responsive to any requirements imposed on his; on
the other hand, he has not been repor:in: on his personal situation and
concacies as silly as he should. This will shape up however.

ACTION REQUIRED. EXPENDENTS
On 29 May ODENY asked KUDESK whether KUERAK had a
current interest in LICOCKY as they had questions concerning Juan
Jose ASRVALO and Lyle STUAE which they wanted passed to her.
If we had no current contact they wanted to know whether we
had any idea of her present whereabouts.
2. KUBARK orally told ODENY that we formerly utilized her
as a sub-source and we believed we could reestablish contact with
her in order to pass to her the ODENY questions. ODENY was told
that she was in Mexico.
3. ODENY subsequently furnished the attached list of
questions. It is requested that the Station pass this list to
LICOCKY-1 and obtain from her, answers to be forwarded to
Headquarters for passing to ODENY. The Station is asked to
comment on whether her testimony in court might be prejudicial
to any KUBAKE operations, or whether the Station can see no
objection to such a court seocerauce.

Chief, WH Division
SUBJECT
LICOKY-1
ACTION HOSPURIED-DEPENDES
REF: HOMA-22258
1. LICOCKY-1 was granted an OA on 27 January 1964 for use as
outlined in the PMI II forwarded with HOMA-222.8. The OA as
granted, however, was restricted to approval to use LICOKY-1 in
such a manner that information is taken from the U.S. to little
in the U.S. to the U.S. to the U.S. to passad. Specific
requirements should be passed only when necessary, and should be
made in such a mank. that sensitive operational or OTOKEI programs,
plans, and objectives are not revealed. The office granting the
OA also indicated that the limitations proposed in the Station's
comments in Section XVI of the PM2 II should be implemented.
2. If LICOCKY-1 is ever to be used as a directed and fully
controlled asset, without the limitations expressed above, an
amendment to the OA will be necessary.
3. Reference is made to Section A, para 1 of the PMI II
forwarded in ref, which indicates that LICOOKY-1 may be given a
bonus for a particularly outstanding job. The Station is reminded
that the U.S. to COCKY-1 is a Contract Agent, and PBPRIKE citizen,
the contract must be amended each time a bonus payment is
contemplated.
