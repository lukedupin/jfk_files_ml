2. COLOVBIA.
The ANSBELL team arrived in Bocota on 12 February
1984. It was the unable contract with the local ASPELL/AMBARB
1984 must be received next day. They were unable to get adequate advance
publicity and had trouble finding space for the exhibit. About 200.
persons attended the exhibit, and ASPELL conferences were attended by
approximately 485 persons. HLBA-6911reported GISENAKER-9's observations
on the local reaction to the tour, which he judged to be indifferent.
The ASPELL team freely admitted to WAVE that the Bocota is
something less than successful, but-blamed the lack of advance prepara-
tions and the existence of an unfriendly press for their failure. It
should also be a very good example. ASPELL team was able to set the best of terms
with some of the local Cumbins, and this fact probably
to do with the poor showing.
b. Medollin. The showing in Medellin was better than in
Bogota. The press was lukewarm but the director of the Caracol radio
station gave them considerable publicity, and they were able to hold
the exhibit in a central spot in the city. About 400 persons visited
the exhibit over a period of three days, and 850 persons attended con-
ferences given.
Cali. The team received good advance press Pfay in Cali,
which was perhaps one reason for the fact that the local Communist party
was also well prepared for their arrival. On the very first morning
of the exhibit, a large crowd of Communists tried to enter the exhibit
with the obvious intention of the program. The second year, the
concerned that the news and "stinkbombs" into the exhibit hall.
The incident provided considerable publicity for ASPELL, as reported
in BOGO 4332. A total of 100 persons attended the exhibit. The ASPELL
team claimed that the Communists were very strong in Cali and that work-
ing there was like swimming upstream.
3. ECUADOR.
a. Quito. The team arrived in Quito on 25 March, after spend-
ing several days in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain visas for Peru.
QUIT 5867 reported the ASPELL team's personality clashes with the
local AMBARBs and the consequent poor performance of the American
