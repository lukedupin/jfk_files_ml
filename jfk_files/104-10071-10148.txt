AND THAT PERKING APPARENTLY NOT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT VISIT THOUGH
STILL HAS HOPES OF BEING ABLE GO CHINA FROM NEW DELHI WHERE HE
I
PROCEEDED OFROM ETHIOPIA.
4. IN PRIVATE TALKS WILLIANS DISPLAYED CURIOUSLY AMBIVALENT
AIIITUDE TOWARD MARTIN LUTHER KING - HE CLEARLY HARBORS RESENT-
MENTS OF KING'S RELATIVELY AFFLUENT BACKGROUND AS COMPARED WITH
HIS OWN.
5. WILLIANS HAD SOME CONTACT WITH ETHIOPIAN STUDENIS AND
INTELLECTUALS CRITICAL OF REGINE AS WELL AS WITH SOME SOUTHERN
SUDANESE AND THIS KAS OPENED UP HIS EYES TO PROBLEM OF INDIVIDUAL
FREEDOM IN AFRICA. JEPYX/1 ASKED HIM HOW HE LOOKED AT PROBLEM
OF FUTURE OF FREEDOM FOR INDIVIDUAL IN AFRICA AS COMPARED WITH
FREEDOMS OF INDIVIDUAL BLACK AMERICANS AND HE ADMITTED THAT
PROSPECTS FOR EXPANSION INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM IN AFRICA DID NOT
SEEN GOOD AND THAT BOTH BLACK AMERICAN'S PRESENT STATUS AND
PROSPECTS APPEARED SUPERIOR TO CONDITION AFRICANS ON THIS SCORE.
5. OVERALL JEPYX/1 EVALUATION WILLIANS: "HE HAS A LOT TO
LEARN AND THIS TRIP IS OPENING HIS EYES AND CONFRONTING HIM
WITH FACTS AND IDEAS HE OTHERWISE COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF. HE IS
LITELY TO PROFIT FROM IT BECAUSE HE IS BASICALLY INTELLIGENT
AND CAPABLE AND NOT JUST A MUT LIKE JONO LOGAN." GP-1.
