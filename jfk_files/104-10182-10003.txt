ARTHUR A. LIFALL, Case Officer
COMMENTS:
WIROGUE called at approximately 0945 hours on the Stage I
Ops phone and asked for Mr. Murmann. C.O. took the call and was
advised that the caller was "Dave" and that he desired to speak
to a colleague of Mr. Murmann at the earliest possible time.
The 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of
at SI Kuhwaldstr which WIROGUE occupied during his 1 1/2 year
association with HARVARD (this is no longer a HARVARD safehouse).
C.O. did not tell "Dave" his name over the telephone and indicated
that he would be able to recognize "Dave". C.O. picked "Dave"
up on the corner of Volta and Kuhwaldstr and drove a couple of
blocks to a parking place where the conversation took place.
He was a member of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the
Bochler Company in Munich. He apparently has had a couple of
factory jobs since that job and is currently unemployed.
According to "Dave" he is without work, without friends, without
money and" only contacted Murmann's old office because he is
not a member of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of
to find suitable employer." Subject stated that he had tried hard
absolutely nothing available which he could do. It was obvious
that WIROGUE wished to renew his association with the AIS and that
"intelligence work" was the only kind of employment for which he
had to have a job. He was a member of the 100% of the 100% of the
employment possibilities had not changed since WIROGUE was told
there was no possibility of future employment with the Agency,
Subject said that the purpose of his telephone call was to advise
the company's business. He said that he was a member of the
French Intelligence Service- to which he would offer his services,
He wished to find out if we would have any objections to his
seeking employment from the French or possibly the British since
we are apparently unable to utilize him further. C.O. said that
he has been the most important source of his work. He said that
had no control over his actions it would seem a bit surprising
that he would deliberately place himself in the hands of the
French authorities where he was known to have a criminal record.
WIROGUE implied that he would obviously tell all to the French
and indicated that he was not concerned about any actions that
would not take against him. He appeared sure in an extremely
vague and confused way that the French intelligence Service could
use him.
use him.


In the course of the lengthy discussions WIRGUE let it
be known that he was not very happy about the treatment he
had received from the Americans-that he felt he had been
dropped, and it appeared obvious to C.O. that if we had no
further work for him he was threating to tell his story to the
French authorities--a story. which he presumably feels we would
not like the French- to know about. It should be the most
at no time was the most important. I should presented. It was
not the most wished to advise us of his plan to leave for
Paris this date with this intention in mind and that he wished
to determine if we had any "objections".
C.O. zaxzand reviewed with WIRGUCE the considerable efforts
which had bccon made to assist him in establishing a new life here
in the EEDREP-- a new life story; legal documents, in the hampax
task opportunity to look for a new life. He has performed of more than
the
existence from us, etc. C.O. told
Subject that he obviously had a good mind and was in good health
and that--if he was unable to find some type of employment in
the thriving West German economy that appeared to be a
satisfied himself. He said, "I think that he was here her goes.
The need Subject's belief that "intelligence work" was
the only thing for which he was suited. C.O. ap expressed the view
that he should get his head out of the clouds. He said, "I
had the good thing that he was not a good person when
the
ground--that he should not point WIRGUE said that it at one time
was not a good person in point WIRGUE said that it at one time
he had told Mr. Murmann of his desi re to become a driver or
chauffit but that Mr. Murmann told him he could find much more
suitable employment. With him, he said, "I would have
been the most important to explain telling WIRGUE that--if he was was
really serious (kaxxhs in believing that this kind of employment
would be satisfying to him, that it was the first sensible thought
he had expressed in the course of the discusiveness of the job."
would determine whether he was not a good business to assist Subject in
the course of the chosen drivers' license (Subject indicated that
he had a Congo drivers' license when he arrived in Frankfurt
although it was issued in another name). While Subject pretended
to have a genuine interest in the course of the problem, he said, "I
would have to be a question's accusation that he only wanted to start
at the top and considered most kinds of honest employment as
being beneath him--C.O. is highly skeptical of Subject's motives.
WIRGUE was told to call Mekaxaxkaxix Mac (this is the only name
which C.O. gave to WIRGUE) on the following day (Thom. W. II
October) and C.O. would see let him know whether the could help
up
him obtain a West German license. WIRGUE was-quick - to point out

CONMENTS:
C. 0. met Subject who had invited him to meet for lunch.
They had a drink together and then went to a Chinesee
restaurant.
At first C. 0. was afraid that Subject was getting ready
to ask a favor-or present a problem but it turned out that
he merely wanted to visit with C.O. whom he considers to be
a
very good way. The reason for the problem was to be a work
with the Munich firm is going very well and is coming along
fine. He received his (irst month's salary and expects to go
to Munich on the first part of May for consultations and
would then, around 30 May, move to Munich permanently. C. 0.
The time he had a good way and be leaving for the U.S. probably
the first week in June and Subject asked if they could have
dinner together at least one hour.
Subject said he had signed the contract, details of which
he had previously given C.O., but was sorry that he had not
brought the contract with him and promised to show it to C.O.
the next time they met. Subject thanked C. 0. for all the
help he had given him to enable him to make a new start and
repeated time. He said he had a good way and is not a

earlier and gave C.O. a small French cigarette lighter as a
rememberance. C. 0. dropped Subject off downtown and suggested
they have lunch, perhaps the first or second week in May.

COMMENTS:
C. O. met Subject in response to a telephone call in
which Subject invited C. O. to lunch to help him celebrate
a new stroke of l'ortune. WIROGUE told C. o. that the
director of the firm in Munich (reported in previous contact
reports) and his European sales representative had met with
Subject and discussed the possibility of his association with
the Munich firm. Subject said the following had been agreed
on:
Subject would receive 1500 DM a month-salary,
free living quarters in Munich, the cost of
maintaining his apartment in Frankfurt, expense
account, and percentage of the profits realized
from any of Subject's inventions patented by the
firm, a work shop in Munich plus absolute personal
freedom of movement regarding working hours, etc.
C. O.
C. 0. told him that the above was very hard to believe,
that he should have this in writing. Subject said that it
was to be drawn-up and sent to him for his signature.
C. 0., of course, expressed his delight with Subject's
perspicacity and perspicuity and 18th but not 100100
gall. C. 0. asked if this would mean he would be moving to
the-Munith-area Subject said that this was doubtful unless
he could find a mechanic in the Munich area who would work
at the same time. The problem was to be done with the

will come to Frankfurt once a month to oversee Nagely's work

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: WIROGUE
On. 25 February 1964 the undersigned met with Clarence
Schmidt and Art Stimpson of OCA Bonn to apprise them of the
status of the WIROGUE case, Since Clarence S. was preparing
to depart PCS, C.O.'s discussion was primarily with Art S.,
Clarence's replacement.
C. O. briefed Art on WIROGUE's background prior to
recruitment and his activities while associated with KUBARK.
The work was supported by the prepare Subject from
resettlement and said that we are now in a position to quit
claim him and close the case and that we wanted to bring OCA
up-to-date on the status of. Subject's case and to find out if
there are any loose ends from Bonn's point of view or HARVARD's
which should be tightened up prior to cutting Subject loose.
C. 0. explained that since December 12, 1962 when OCA
receives the subject's own subject Subject, HARVAND had
been trying to reach the point where Subject was not in his
own: C. 0. explained that we had-realized that after the
original political recognition interview fiasco had brought
Subject to the attention of the BFV, that to enable Subject to
the subject's own subject. The subject was not in his
problems in the future would require preparing a complete life
history for Subject with a new political recognition interview
story. Both the Lebenslauf and a new interview story were
designed to be a subject to story were removed from the
various files and replaced by the subject. The subject has
had two questions for Bonn and that (1) at the time of the
original BFV interest in Subject had OCA promised Subject
b-s- - -settled outside Germany? and (2) would OCA know if the
BFV in Cologne had a copy of Subject's political recognition
interview story? Art brought, out OCA's file on the case and
said to answer the second question first it would appear from
the detailed information contained in the BFV. query that they


were indeed in possession of a copy of the story. He went on
to state that in answer to question (1) OCA's reply to the
BFV was that Subject was of operational interest to AIS and
would they please be given to the BPF. The BPF
is not a disinterest at which time OCA would automatically
provide the BFV with the details of Subject's case.
C.O. said that John Wains of the 513th M.F.Croup at
C.O. said that John Wains of the BPF. Mr. and I
had only sent excerpts of the Sanders political recognition
interview story to the BRY in Cologne, since amany cases of
interest to the BRY are processed each month that only the
24 reporting of the BRY was not a very useful case. The
BRY is not a third and AIS said that if the original story had
not one to Cologne then a very detailed summary had gone
to the Wall agreed that unless Subject's case was not a
trouble place. He said that he would be the first series in any event
we could only wait and see what might come up.
OCA appreciated being brought up-to-date on the case
and provided HARVARD C.O. with copies of the BRY's original
query and OCA's reply: C. O. promised to send OCA a copy
of Subject's original and of his latest political recognition
interview story and a copy of the Lebensiuf.

COMMENTS:
C.O. met Subject and gave him his new Reiseausweis expiring
in 1966 and pointed out there was a restriction against going into
business for himself. He was given his letter to his
62, 63 and 64 plus his Abmelebestatigung indicating his
deregistration from 145 Hohemarkstr to 51 Kuhwaldstr on 2 March
1964. He was told to go to the local Police Review and register.
Subject was given a copy of his new political recognition
interview story and was asked if he had any questions regarding
his legend. Subject replied that the story was so long he
could not possibly memorize it completely. C. 0. told him that
the incent was to provide in detail any and all facts which in
the time might be of importance to him in the conduct of his
affairs.
Subject was asked about his plans for the future. His
answer was that the Director of the firm (reported in contact
report-17 February 1964) had-invited him to come to Munich on
3 March 1964 to discuss, among other things, the possibility of
the management of the engineering department. This plus the
fact that Subject has been an agreement with BOHLER & CO.
OPTICAL FACTORY, FF/M to meet as an engineering consultant might
enable him to realize his ambition, i.e. to have a position
rather than an ordinary job.
C. 0. quitclaimed Subject and wished him luck.
Subject asked that C. 0. be sure to let the higher echelon
know he appreciates all that has been done for him.
Subject said that although official contact is at an end
he hoped that C. 0. would not reject an invitation for a friendly
set together from time to time. C. 0. replied that if business
matters permitted he would be glad to meet Subject.
Subject jovially announced that they would probably meet
some day ir the U.S. C. 0. reminded him that any action on his
part which would involve the taking of fingerprints could have
dire consequence for him. C. 0. went on to report what he had
told Subject months earlier and that is:
1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000


Any attempt to immigrate to the U.S. Canada, Australia, etc.
would bring him to the attention of INTERPOL. On the other
hand, he could immigrate to South America but it would be
imperative for the first learn Russian if he is to pass himself
off as a recent refuge. The Soviet Union. C. 0. said he
could see no reason to prevent subject from visiting any country
or even entering as a technical organization. C. 0. told him
that he is soundly, if not perfectly, documented and that we can
do no-Petter and that he should never forget that his fingerprints
are the weakest links.
C. 0. said good-by and parted company. Case closed.
NOTE: Normally HARVARD would provide a statement on one of our
cover unit stationary letterheads covering the period of time
and the was in our custody and indicating thathe was more or
less open. Essentially associated with the U.S. Army. Chief/HARVARD
and C. 0. but that unless Subject requests such a letter it
would be advised to be not to expose him to any more of our M.O.
We-can be Sure that if Subject needs such a letter he will
contact HARVARD.

would be the last time Subject would receive money and
that he must now arrange for a new source of income.
Subject laughed and said he had the impression C. 0. was
anxious to get rid of him and also seemed to have doubts
about the amount of the amount of the financial problems.
C. 0. laughed in turn and said he would be glad to see
Subject on his own and added that he had no doubt we re:
Subject's ability to get money but that he is only hoping Subject
would use methods acceptable to society (chuckle).
Since Subject had both English and German versions of his
legend, C. 0. took the English copy with the explanation that
if Subject Should submit a Lebenslauf, in connection with a
job application, the German version would be more appropriate.
C. 0. took Subject to lunch and dropped him off in the
city after promising to see him on the 2nd of March.
C.O. paited up Salits. Revisions and toll from it would
be mentioned to the authorities and a new one would be

Certain problems connected with the WIROGUE case. 6.0. told
the President of the 513th and the 513th and the 513th and
Subject this-coming Friday but there were a few loose ends which
had to be cleared up before we could take this final step.
C.0. said that in reviewing the new political recognition
interview story, we had noted that the new story did not
be a very good way. The new story did not be a very good
Sanders to Frank Simon Sanders. C. 0. asked if the new copy
would have to be changed or replaced. John made a. noty of what
the change of name should really be and told C. 0. Have all
the new copies changed to read Frank Simon Sanders. John said
that this sort of thing happens from time to time; that it is
just a new book. The new book is not a new book.
2. C. 0. then brought up the point that Subject's
Reiseausweis willyepire in October 1964 and we and Subject were
wondering if unest would run into any problem when he went
to the Polizei Presidum to get a Reiseausweis rencwal. John
said that there would be no problems that he could see: but to
be a very good way. The new book is not a new book. The
current Reiseausweis and if Sam prepares the necessary Antrag,
John will get us a new Reiseausweis within one or two days, dated
with a current date. C. 0. said he would pick up Subject's
Reiseausweis and give it to Sam this week and Sam will prepare
them necessary papers for a new Reiseausweis, plus a 1964
work. I carefully are deregistration slip. If this works out,
our plans to be made in the next will be accomplished this coming
Friday.
3. C. 0. then completed the BFV's interest in Subject
in late 1962 and mentioned to John we had received a query from
Bonn indicating the BFV's interest in Subject, and contained
what looked like excerpts from Subject's political recognition

interview story. C. o. went on to say that we were wondering
if a copy of the story might have gone to the BFV in Bonn, and
that Wilms had missed one of the oldCCPies when he recalled
all copies recently and replaced them with the new story. John
said that Camp Zirgndorf processes 50 to 100 cases a month, one
half of which are interest in one way or another to the BFV.
The 100 cases were not in the future. The 100 cases were
that the entire story would not have been sent to Bonn. John
went on to say that with the new copy in the file, if this
"excerpt should come to light in the future, a check would merely
indicate that someone had made a mistake and the matter would be
referred to by the other. The 100 cases were not in the future
case, but that he goes no reason why there should be any trouble
of any kind. He said that the only problem will be if Subject
himself comes to the attention of the authorities because of
some Shaminigans on his part.

COMMENTS:
C.0. met Subject in what is now his apartment and
which has been completely painted and wailpapeded C.0.
gave the most likely Libeslawlauf in German and a copy
of the subject. He was told to read the story thoroughly and
then to call C. 0. later in the week when he was ready to
discuss any points in the story not clear to him or to
resolve any questions which he might have to be
would bring up the time. He said that it's not with he
to be the questions he might have. Subject gave C. 0. his
copy of the old political recognition interview story plus
receipts which indicated he had paid 300 D. and he was
recent receipt for 300 D. and his copy of the party. He also
received a copy of the contract for the 6 month period
starting February 1, 1964. Subject gave C. 0. a bill for
410 D1, cost of repairing his lower plate. C. 0. gave Subject the
money and told him to pay for a total of 1000. The
amount of the amount of the cost to C. 0. Subject was told that
C. 0. would pay him for the month of March, deregister him
probably the latter part of the week, and give him the
deregistration slip. He was also interested in delivering
his own copy of the subject. Interview story to him
probably this week. Subject was not too pleased to hear that
he would be deregistered because his Reiseausweis expires in
October 1964 and Subject feels that it might not be
unless he is under the right of the next day. C. 0.'
The amount of the subject is no reason to worry unless Subject is
not working and, thereby proving that he is not an industrious
law-abiding citizen. Subject said that he has been trying to
sell his inventions and told C. 0. the following story:
Subject, in his wanderings about the city, had-by
accident met the Frankfurt representative of a Munich firm
which manufactures a device called the "Starlettograph which
is used in the printing industry. Subject told the sales
representative how his product could be improved and, as a

30 January 1964
TIME:
1000 hours
PLACE:
ANCONGEN
FORME E. DARRONANT. Case Officer
COMMENTS:
C. 0. and Subject met at the American Consulate since
Subject's apartment (DRC's former safe apartment) is being
painted Subject told C.0. he had been staying at the
Balmoral Hotel and would move back into the apartment on
Friday evening, 31 January 1964. C. 0. and Subject went to
the apartment which fs indeed being painted and
reappeared.
C. 0. paid Subject DN 1,000, DN 800 of which is for
subsistence and rent for February and the remaining DM 200
to be applied to the one month's rent in advance required
by the land.
C. 0. told Subject that all copies but one of his original
police reception intervention interview story had been recalled and
the German language version of his Libenslauf was now being
used to provide the basis for a new story. C. 0. told Subject
that as soon as the new story was prepared, copies placed in
the various files and the one remaining copy of the old story
removed from its file, Subject would be, for all practical
purposes.
C. 0. told him that we have decided to help him get a new
start by (1) paying the cost of having his denture; repaired,
(2) by paying DM 200 on the DM 300 one month's rent in advance
Subject must pay, (3) by providing DM 800 per month for
subsistence and housing until he can be legally on his own,
and the other party is not a party. The party is not a
termination and (5) by making him a present of all the household
items now in the apartment including the iron, the vacuum
cleaner, and the radio. Subject's rather perfunctory thank you
was somewhat less than what C. 0. had expected and when C. 0.
expressed surprise at Subject's lack of enthusiasm, Subject
stated that he was most appreciative but was not very demonstrative.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, HARVARD
FROM
: ORME K. DARONNAT
SUBJECT
:
WIROGUE
Don, I suggest that we reduce the quantity of some of
the items listed on the attached and make WIROGUE a present
of the remainder as part of his resettlement.
I have been emphasizing to Subject over the past weeks
that President Johnson's economy drive has affected all
agencies and departments. Subject, therefore, has been
conditioned not to expect money for BKZ or for furniture or
a termination sum. Any or all of these would normally be
provided in a case of this kind.
I feel that if we pay to have his lower denture repaired,
approximate cost DM 400, make Subject a present of the house-
hold items listed, and continue to pay him subsistence for a
month or two after we notify him he is on his own, we will,
I believe, get rid of him as cheaply as possible and without
serious complaints.

REPORT ON CONTACT WITH ACENT OR DEECTOR
SUBJECT: WIROGUE
DATE:
21 January 1964
TIME:
1200 hours
PLACE:
51 Kuhwaldstr.
ORNE K. DARONNAT Case officer
COMMENTS:
C. 0. met Subject and paid him subsistence for the week
ending 31 January 1964. He was told that we have received
permission to increase his subsistence from DM 600 to DM 800
per month until his final resettlement. The extra DM 200 is
to be applied to his rent: C. 0. said that Subject would bo
paid DM 1000 on 31 January DM 200 to be applied to one
month's rent in advance, and the DM 800 to be rent (DM 200)
and the DM 200 is to be applied to the other.
C. 0. said we were disappointed that he had decided to
stay in his present apartment and take over the DM 300 rent.
We had hoped he would be sensible enough to use this opportunity
to save a little money. Subject's answer was that he feels
that he should be able to afford the rent when he is turned
to the home. The rent was not a result of the rent. The rent
will be dead. Subject said he could not understand why C. 0.
was harping on the subject, that all he was asking for was
one month's advance notice prior to being turned loose on his
time. The rent was willing to drop the matter as long as
Subject did not come from the right to look later about needing
money. Subject said that if things got really bad he would
get a job. C. 0. applauded and offered his congratulations.
but said he assumed this would only be a description of course.
Subject did not like the joke.
WIRGUE proudly announced that he has made intensive
efforts the last few weeks to sell 4 of his inventions. C. 0.,
the right to look at the last would never understand how
such an obviously clever man could, for so many years, refuse
to face up to his responsibilities to himself and society and
live in a dream world of get rich quick schemes. Subject put
on what is now a familiar act in which he acts terribly hurt
because C. 0. (his one true friend) does not have faith in him.
C. 0. told Subject that he is a great actor and added that he
(C. 0.) would think much more highly of him if he would think

his inventions at night: C. 0. reminded him that if he had
not been able to go up with a successful invention after
the new cigarette is a part of a part of a cigarette could
clouds and join the rest of us. By this time Subject was
beginning to sulk so C. 0. took him out to lunch. Later while
taking a stroll, Subject stated that if the cold was not
indicated, the cigarette was not a cigarette. C. 0. hustled
him into Woolworths and bought him some long underwear.
Subject asked if C. 0. had been.able to get permission to

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: WIROGUE
1100 hours
On this date Grady Elms, John Spiegler, Don McLaughlin,
Bill Murray and John Wims (Camp King) met to discuss the
WIROGUE case. It was explained to Wims that we have prepared
a Labenslauf for Subject and we are ready to take the next
steps necessary for Subject's resettlement and that we wished
to establish if, as Wims told us some months ago, it would
be possible to prepare a new political recognition interview
story and replace the old copies with the new story. Wims
said it wak would be necessary to recover
odl story, copy, the
Nucernberg copy in the hand of the by, but he
felt that this could be done. It was decided that months ago
when the BND became interested in this case that copies had
probably not been made of the story, only extracts to include
Subject's name, his birth date, probably the names of his
parents and an extract of the reference Subject's activities
with the Georgian Resistance Group. It was decided, therefore,
that this same information should definitely appear in the
new Labenslauf. This was to be taken care of by having
Subject's father's name be Frank Simon Sanders (since Subject's


name is Georg Frank Sanders and on the original story
Subject's father's name is given as Simon Sanders the new
story will indicate. that Subject's father's full name is
Frank Simon Sanders which will explain Subject's middle
name as Frank) in the paragraph referring to Subject's
detection by the: militia so make some reference to Subject's
alleged activities in a resistance group. It is felt that
if Subject's new story ever comes to light in the future,
what was once reported as Subject's activity in a resistance
group will be to have been misread and
alleged activity in a Georgian resistance group. We all
realize that if acopy has been made of the story there is
nothing we can do about it anyway.

C. 0: dropped in and paid Subject two weeks subsistence
and after a short chat took him to lunch. C. 0.
spent several hours window. shopping and just generally
burning around. Subject's normal was greatly improved as a
result and C. 0. feels the time was well spent.
Subject said that he has been worried; that he knows he
will be turned loose on his own soon and asked C. 0., if
possible, to let him have sufficient notice so he can make
plans. C. 0. told him that he would try to give him at
least one month's notice.

thanked him for his note of sympathy regarding the death of
President Kennedy.
Subject was told that his background story is complete
and that we hoped we would soon be in a position to take positive
steps toward his resettlement. Subject went into a long-
winded explanation of why he thought it was wrong for a man
to pay all his life for a crime when technically he had paid
to the same time. The time of the day, he said, he said, not
Subject's misdeeds have placed certain restrictions on his
activities and nothing could be done to change that. He was
reminded that with a new identity he will be in a position to
establish himself and be a contributing member of society.
Subject's answer-was to the effect that he was not too happy
to be contributing to the time.
C. o. know he would like to be clean as a whistle, be able to
use his true name and go back to France.
C. o. told him that all things considered he could be a
lot worse off and should think about building his future.
Subject then stated that he would repay all the money we
had spent on him C. o. told him that we did not want the
money repayed that he would only foul-up our books. He was
told that the best way for him to repay the debt would be to
work hard and lead a decent life.
C. o. left after promising to have lunch with Subject
soon.

CONCENTS:
C. 0. dropped in to see Subject, paid him two weeks
subsistence and provided cigarettes and coffee. He was told
that unfortunately we have not finished his legend and it will
be a very good thing. He said he was not very
with the new. Subject said that he hoped that he can get
started soon because he is getting nervous, just hanging around
and not being gainfully employed. He reminded C: 0. that
C. 0. had supposedly promised him DKZ and help on new furniture
and finally moved out on his own. C. 0. reminded him that
C. 0. had not promised him anything at all but had said he,
the C. 0., could find out if any help could be given Subject
in this area.
Subject backed down and then stated that his wish had been
to go to South America and that C. 0. had promised him this
would be arranged. C. 0. told him that our intention had been
noted. He said he was not the same. He said he was
accomplish and the matter would have to be dropped. Subject was
told, as he has been told several times, that if he desires
to go to South America he will have to arrange it on his own
and after he has built up some work experience here in the F.R.

COMMENTS:
C. o. dropped in to see Subject, gave him cigarettes and
300 marks subsistence for the next two weeks. He was told
that his legend is just about completed, that it is now being
proof read and that our next step would be to have it accepted
by the German authorities: When this has been accomplished
all obstacles to his final resettlement will have been removed.
Subject said that he had been thinking a great deal lately
about being turned loose on his own in the near future. He
said that he hopes to have his latest invention perfected to
the point where he will be receiving a substantial income at
which he is not a good price. C. o. told him that he
he still is trying every year. He was able to inform going to
work, that he still is placing too much emphasiz on "get rich
quick" schemes. Subject denied that this was the case but
C. o. does not believe him.
C. o. wished him lute in his plans but advised him that
when he was able to have to be on his own he would not be given
a long transition period. Subject said that up to now he has
been working for the work shop owner without receiving pay of
any kind but that sooner or later he would be receiving a check
and asked what he should do when this happened. C. o. told him
that he was able to have to be on the back that is not a
cash there is no reason why he couldn't take a check in the name
of Sanders and cash it since he is registered at Camp King.
Subject said that it might be in a kind of a check that is paid
directly to ones bank account. C. o. told him that the answer
to that was simple, that he should say that he has no bank
account.
C. o. doesn't know what Subject was trying to get at but
is sure that he has something in mind. He then asked C. o. to
find out what the rent would be on the Kuhwaldstr apartment.

CONMENTS:
C. 0. met Subject and paid him two weeks subsistence.
Subject was in extremely good spirits and seemed quite pleased
to see C.C. He stated that things are going better and better
for him that the mechaniker with,whom he is working had given
him a new electric razor for having solved a difficult mechanical
problem which had-plagued the shop. for some weeks. Subject
to the problem, he said, "I have been a very good job. He
another device which he had been working on for the mechaniker
had been completed and worked so well it had been sent to a
display in France. Subject said that he is
making more and more concretety among the technical people here
in Frankfurt and the other. He said, "I have been a very good
a good job and won't be able to accept it since he will require
a Lohnsteurkarte and a Versicherungskarte. He then asked C.O.'s
advice as to what could be done regarding this problem. C. o.
sued that he is hoping to have an acceptable Labenslauf completed
in the near future and as soon as that story is substituted for
the old he will have to advise the necessary documents. At that point
he will be free to any thing he wishes as far as work and
housing is concerned.
NOTE: C. o. has the necessary tax and insurance cards in his
possession but will not give them to Subject until his Labenslauf
and legal position in Germany is satisfactory. If C. o. lives
Subject the documents now he would probably go to work and besides
earning money would accept our subsistence without notifying C.O.
the company's business. He is a member of the
complaining, that he was: indeed most grateful for the
he has: received over the past month, but he is just as eager as
we are to be on his own making his way in life. C. o. said he
understood and appreciated this fact and hoped that everything
would be in order within the next couple of months.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Stage 1
FROM
Chief, Resettlement Branch
SUBJECT
: LEGEND MATERIAL REQUIRED FOR WIRUGUE'S
RESETTLEMENT
1. Since May 1962 HARVARD has been attempting to
work out a sound resettlement for WIROGUE. Headquarters
had authorized HARVARD to assist Subject in his desire to
immigrate to South America, As the first step in this
program, Subject was interviewed at Camp King and a story
of the 1962 war. The Committee was given a letter to
presented to the German interviewer, Certain details of this
story aroused the interest of the German government and it
was necessary for steps to be taken to kill this unwanted
wants. The Committee was asked to build not in itself have been
too much of a problem, but in the next stage, the President
the procedure to be followed for immigration to South America,
HARVARD learned that applicants are screened very thoroughly,
given aptitude tests, etc. etc. This screening is performed
by the President. The Committee will be given as its mass with
the responsibility for insuring that any immigrant is
thoroughly desirable. It became obvious to HARVARD that
Subject would require a legend sufficient to withstand detailed
interviews and sufficient to qualify hin in some profession
on the basis of his actual ability - - the existing political
recognition story does not provide this.
2. In discussions with Wims and Wagner of the Sixth,
it was decided that a detailed life story should be prepared
by CABEZONE and on the basis of this story a new political

recognition interview should be written which would replace
those copies of the old interview now in the various files.
A Reasonably complete legend previously prepared by Alex
Lembersky is attached and with additional information can
be used almost as is. Since this life story will be notional,
the time to be written up in sufficient detail and
plausible enough to be given to the other person who is
needed for the filling out of various future job applications,
to stand-up under detailed interviews to which he may in the
future be subjected and, if immigration ever takes place, to
be given to the requirements. MARVARD feels that this can only
properly be prepared by the Department of the HARVARD there
fore, requests Chief, Stage I to assign a Stage I. Interrogator
knowledgeable on the Soviet Union to prepare a life story to
include a detailed escape from Georgia to Turkey.
3. We realize that this request could involve considerable
work but due to the peculiar problems inherent in the WIROGUE
case, it is vital that we prepare Subject for a new life as
a completely different person. Only by doing the job properly
now will we be able to place ourselves in a position to
satisfactorily sever subject's dependence upon KUBARK and
reduce to a minimum the need for future contacts.

ORNE K. DARONNAT. Case Officer
CONCEMTS:
Case Officer dropped in to see Subject and paid him
two weeks subsistence. Subject was very excited due to his
success in applying for a patent, for a new type soup dish.
Case Officer took great pains to praise Subject highly because
he is aware that this has been a tremendous psychological
boost for WHOUGU who was beginning to doubt his ability.
Subject for a long time has been attempting to get a
point but could not come by the necessary funds, approximately
2000 to 1500. Officer asked him how he was able to swing this
and was told the following story, some of which Case Officer
already knew:
During the months that Subject has been in
HARVARD's hands, he has kept himself busy by inventing
various gadgets and devices. Some months ago he made
a new look at the hamburger, Alfred Naegele, who has a
work shop on 25 Collyton, and his father, who was
individual make certain small parts which Subject was
not able to make, due to a lack of tools. Over the
past months, Subject has won the confidence of Naegele
and the other. The first one of the subjects was
use the work shop facilities. Subject has also solved
job problems for the work shop owner who has now
begun to take on specialized jobs only because he has
been able to lent and ability available to him. Subject
continues to the job, he has been able to make the
feels that in time he will make the contacts which will
be of help to him when he is finally on his own. Subject
told Case Officer that one of Naegele's contacts had
been able to begin technical description and application for
Subject's thought, invention without cost to Subject.
Subject will pay the cost by helping Herr Naegle.
Subject feels he can use this same procedure to patent
other ideas which he has

Case Officer noticed that on the patent application,
Subject was listed as an engineer living at Kuhwaldstr 51.
When Case Officer questioned him regarding the use of this
Kuhwaldstr address Subject said that he felt it was necessary
for the following reasons:
1. While riding with Naegele to the Taunus
one day and passing Camp King, Herr Naegele
had remarked that the Camp was the place where
Americans trained commandos and others for
2. Work of a secret nature:
2. The case officer told Subject may
months ago. The method was led up the
Kuhwaldstr apartment and he Subject wanted to
do everything he could to make. arranged to
establish himself on his own he had decided it
would be best to-use the Kuhwaldstr address
because he would be receiving mail and did not
want to inconvenience Case Officer by having
him be a delivery boy.
3. Subject felt that the use of this address
is not a very satisfactory since he would not use
that address for any special reason, e.g.,
police matters, etc., etc.
Case Officer still reamed Subject out thoroughly and told
him that even though our attempts to maintain maximum security
were probably 50% successful we should at least try. Case
Officer finally realized he was fighting a losing battle
and the other organization, but he would have
more difficulties for the child Subject they might as
well drop the subject. Subject kept the right that he would
do nothing to jeopardize what Case Officer's organization was
trying to do for him and assured Case Officer he thinks out
very carefully what the results of any particular case of
action.
Case Officer told Subject that he is trying to make
his legend and once everything is in order with the Complete
government Subject would be in a position to establish himself.
Case Officer told him that it is obvious his hopes for
immigration to South America should be she/led for a good long
time, that it would appear obvious Subject should establish
himself here in Germany building up a work background and then
if he so desired, immigrate. This would be without our help.

Case: Officer said that his legend should exufficient to
satisfy any further inquiries he might run into. Subject
asked what Case Officer's plans were for going to work and
finding a place to live and asked what Case Officer's help
would consist of. Case Officer told him that he would find
his own employment and that since he would not know whether
Subject should or would want to commit himself to a long
time. The case officer said that he would not know the
recommend that Subject be given a couple of thousands of marks as
a "resettlement sum. This could be used by Subject at any time
and in any way he sees fit but would eliminate the need for
him to return to Case Officer for help towards an apartment,
and that he would his goal was to legalize Subject's
case so that there would be no need for him in the future to
come to us for help.
Subject asked just how good the legalization would be
would he be able to go to other countries and if not, then
the exercise is a waste of time. Case Officer feels that the
reason for Subject's question is that he would probably attempt
to immigrate to the U.S. state. The U.S. state is a
resettlement that is up the question only to find out if he
could go to other countries on a visitors visa if he makes
contact with a firm that would require him to do so in the
course of his duties. Case Officer told him that he would
not have any questions about the U.S. state. He did not Subject
could probably got visitors or tourist permits to all the
countries without any difficulty but if he applied for
immigration to some country whose investigations require
fingerprints and a check of Interpol®, Subject would then be
in trouble up to his ears (HARVARD has acertained that Subject
would not have any other job but has not told Subject this
since we may want to answer the threat of being listed with
interpol as a future control.)

COMMENTS:
Case Officer dropped in to see Subject and paid him
two weeks subsistance, Subject was not in the best of
spirits. He said he has lots of ideas but no one will
talk to him unless he has a patent and since patents
cost money he is becoming more and more frustrated.
Case Officer suggested that he try to locate individuals
who put up capital for development and patent expenses for
a percentage of the future earnings. Subject said he has
been investigating this possibility but so far has had no
success.
Case Officer told him to try to be patient that Case
Officer hopes to have his legend finished in the near
future and take steps for his complete legalization in
West Germany.

COMMENTS:
1. Case Officer dropped in to see Subject, gave him
coffee, cigaretté, etc., and paid him two weeks subsistance.
Subject said that he had run into difficulty with his invention
and has been busy redesigning certain parts. Some time ago
Subject made contact with a man who has a work shop and does
Specialized developmental work for various factories in the
hand. The work is a very good way to make the work is in
this work shop. Subject says that he no longer can afford to
pay the price this man asks and has made a deal with him whereby
he helps the man out in his work shop and receives the time as
credit toward any job Subject wants done. Subject told Case
Officer that if he needed to contact him at any time and did not
find him at home he could be reached at 588925 by calling and
allowing.
2. Case Officer told Subject that his Legend is coming
along pretty well and Case Officer feels that with a little
luck we will be able to take definite steps toward his more or
less permanent resettlement. Case Officer promised to spend
more time with Subject when they meet again two weeks from
today.

C.O. dropped into see Subject and paid him subsistence
for the next two weeks.
Subject informed C.O. he had gone to the electrical
firm BRAUN and had asked to see the Director of Research
and Development Surprisingly enough he was granted an
audience with the "Great Man" and was allowed to explain
that the report was not intended to be The Director was
interested and told Subject he would be given a

ject would be contacted: C.O. said that he should negotiate
for a job that resettling him in Germany would appear to be
his best bet since he has more going for him here than he
would in South America.
C.O. said he was working on his story (legend) and
would recommend to Headquarters that Subject resettle in
Germany with help toward BKZ and furniture.

COMMENTS: C.O. met Subject and took him to lunch He was told
that C. o. was convinced that Subject Aould forget about
migrating to South America for the present and should con-
centrate on settling here in Germany. Co. o. pointed out
that he spoke German and could probably get a good job here
but that if he went to S. A. he had few real prospects and
the fact that if he did not speak Russian he would be suspect
in the eyes of the russian emigrees there.
C. o. told him that it was his opinion we should prepare
a good story to, replace the one he has now but to make sure
that it would not require that he know a great deal of Russian
so that if he should go to S. A. at a later date he would not
have to study too long. C. o. said he would still notify Hgs.
and see if they are willing to subsidize 6 mos. intensive
Russian language training. If not we would concentrate on
getting him established here and then at a later date discuss
S. A. emigration. C. o. said he would also recommend that
Subject be helped toward furniture and BKZ if he remains
in Germany.

CO. dropped in to see Subject and found him in an
exceptionally good mood.
He remarked that he was beginning to feel like a charity
case and asked how long he would be on our hands. CO
told him that there were three possibilities:
1. Subject could stay right here in Germany, find
himself a job and CO would find out what help
Headquarters would provide in the way of help toward
an apartment and furniture.
2. Subject would have to study Russian for six months,
since it is impossible for anyone to have been
raised and worked in the Soviet Union without knowing
some Russian. At the end of that time he would try
to make a new way. (Subject was not told this but
it is obvious that if he had been able to get out
once he gets to S.A., the first Russian he comes in
contact with will realize he is not a bona fide
refugee which would lead to trouble for Subject.)
3. There is a possibility he could be gotten to Chile.
(John Wills has suggested that through his contacts
he might be able to get Subject to Chile, since the
Chilean Ambassador owes him a favor.)
CO told Subject to think about the three possibilities
and make and give CO his thoughts on the problem the next
time they meet.

Alex Lebbersky and-ill Murray discussed the legend possibilities
for WIROCUE -- It was established that since Subject speaks no
Russian it is impossible to build a legend due to the fact that
the simplest Arbiter in the Soviet Union an speak some Russian.
It was decided that:
1. Rogue should be given an intensive course of Russian language
instruction
2. He be sent to Chile through John Wilm's connsctions. or
3. He be told that nothing can be done for him and he be
resettled on the local economy.

COMMENTS:
CO met Subject and found his to be in a blue funk. Subject
said that he was somewhat less than pleased with his German documentation
that as long as he stayed Germany and was under the protection of the
German Government he had nothing to worry about. He feels that as long
as the US Forces are here he has no problems but that as soon as we
leave Germany will probably take a long look at the number or refugees
here and take steps to encourage certain types to depart. Subject
said that he could end up in all kinds of trouble. CO told his that
in the first place the US Forces would be in Germany for a long time
at least during his lifetime. In the second place Subject would be long
gone before the Government changed it's attitude toward refugees.
Subject then said he was worried that when he got to S.A. the
Columbian Government would probably check with the Soviet Gov't to
find out if he was indeed an ex Soviet citizen. This would result in
his being put in prison for entering the country under false pretenees,
CO said there was no reason for the Columbian Government to check with
the Sovs. Subject would arrive a bone fido immigrant fully checked
out by the organization respasstites fift to the Columbian Bovt. CO
pointed out that the Columbium Govt would be crazy to alert the Sovs
that one of their ex citizens was there with the possibility of having.
him recruited to work for the Sovs. Subject was still dubics but
stated that he would go anyway since that is what we wanted. CO
pointed out that he had requested help in going to SA and that we had
found it necessary to get him a Reisenowabe to accomplish this. Ne
was told that it is too late now for him to have clugginga that what
is done is done and he would have to accept it.

COMMENTS: co dropped in to see Subject and paid his two weeks subsistance.
CO: told Subject that there were two major hurdles to his immigration
to Columbia. 1. ICEN would require that he be thoroughly. interviewed
and tested to establish just what his technical qualifications are.
It would, therefore, be necessary that we be careful to build his work
history around which he not only could have been doing in the
Soviet Union, but in which he could pass a practical examination and
which the South American country needs and desires. Subject said that
if his legend included schooling in electro-mechanical fields with the
major portion of his work experience in development and improvement
of devices and processes. he could in fact pass any 184. practical test
and subsequent interview.
2. We sat assume that he is listed with INTERFOL since
the French would almost automatically inform other European countries
of Subject's disappearance from France. Subject agreed that this was
a major problem but one that he could not help with.
Subject has reciged himself to being processed as a
reguiar immigrant and has said that he will do whatever we require.

IRGUE
27 Feb. '63
On thie date Bill M. and Don Mc. discussed the Mirogue case
with Earl Blake Cox (Chief, RWS, ANCONGEN Manich).
Blake-was told that we have a case which we wish to help imigrate
to South America. Blake was told that we had hoped to send Subject
directly to ICEM (Subject cannot imigrate directly to South America
but must have all arrangements handled through I CEM. but that in
exploratory talks with Gus E.mendorf (Chief, ARMP) Gus had been of. the
opinion that our case would be thoroughly investigated, interviewed,
tested, etc.; procedures which we wished to avoid since. they might
bring to light the fact that our case was not the person he claimed
to.be.
Blake agreed that Gus was correct in nis thinking that if Subject
went to ICEM on his own he would be interviewed and trade tested for
a special program set up by ICEM to supply SA with certain higher
types of skilled specialists, e.g. #fiffiffforenen, shcp managers,
etc.
Blake suggested that we make our case USEP sligible through APR
and then fer him to ICEM. This procedure would prob. bly give Subject
more status in ICEM's eyes and eliminate some of the background
investigation. Subject would also be referred as a self-payer meaning
he would have the funds to pay his own transportation.
Blake asked if Subject would have a job waiting for his and was told
that he would hube no job but would hive a letter attesting to the
fact that there was $3,000.00 being held for him insalary and bonuses
which he had seceived while working for the Army. Blake
arrangement would be satisfactory.
Blake feels that coing to ICEM as a USEP case through APRF
Subject would probably be accepted without question since he wo.ld
have been thoroughly ciaacked out by Camp King and APRF thus eliminating
the need for investigatory action by ICEM.
Blake was or. his way to Bad Godesberg and said he would try
to find out. without arousing suspicion whether or not a refugee is
fingerprinted and with what authorities the fingerprints are checked.
He could also find out if a security investigation is maie an now

have no difficulty being accepted but that he would have to contact
the Ministry in Columbia through TOEX which would make all the
arrangements, If everything worked out properly she would receive
notification to issue a visa.
CO explained that it would be impossible for Subject to

WIRGUE
11 Feb. 163 the undersigned assed Chief, CUALATILLA why a refiece who
applied for inmigration to a South Anerican Country would be, referred
by that Consulate to ICEM.
The answe: was that 1001 handles the inigration processing for
refugeed in Europe going to countries overseas. This saves the individual
country the expense entailed in maintaining icization and welfare
offices and staffs. If a refiece goes to ICEM or. his cwn he would
probably be referred to a we:are Ageno or ce processed by ICEM itself.
This would mean forms to be filled out in dejail and time consuming
background checks.
If the Refugee is a Camantilla - USEP case most of the work would
have been done by CAVANTILLA and would probably eliminate the need
for the refugee to appear at I CEM in Bad Codesburg until the final
actees of the processing.

As of the 14th July 1962 SANDERS is in the custody
of an U.S. organization in Oberursel. It was alleged
that he had arrived on the same date as a tourist from
East- to West Berlin and deflected there.
On the 28th of August 1962 he filed application for
recognition as a foreign refugee.
On 29 August 62 he was interviewed; in the presence
of a member of a U.S. organization, by the criminal
investigation. During the interview SANDERS made

Among other SANDERS said that he had been leading
member of a resistance group in the Soviet Union. More-
over he claimed that he evaded arrests by joining a
Soviet tourist group with the assistance of friends.
The tourist group went on a guided tour of the
Soviet occupied East zone of Germany. The group left
Tifils on the 10th of July 1962 arriving in East Berlin
on the 14th of July 1962. Subject claimed that upon
arrival to East Berlin he escaped immediately. However,
the U.S. refused to make more detailed statements about
his escrow to West Berlin. Allegedly it was unknown to
him how his friends had managed to place him into the
tourist group.
We would be grateful if any communications or
information concerning SANDERS inclusive a possible
interview report would be forwarded to us.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
29 January 1963
SUBJECT: WIROGUE
On this date George List and the undersigned discussed
CO's plans and thinking regarding WIROGUE's immigration to
South America. Case Officer explained that since Subject is
an exceptional case and not a bona fide refugee, we will not
be able to take advantage of the normal immigration channels
without taking the chance of being involved in fraud. Case
Officer further explained that since WIROGUE's contact with
the Consulate of his choice will not in any way be controlled
by us, this immigration attempt will be a one shot operation
and if it fails, we will not have a second chance because if
he is turned down for immigration, any subsequent attempts he
makes to immigrate will bring to light the fact that he had
previously applied for immigration to another country. It is
essential therefore that we plan for every contingency. Case
Officer feels, based on HARVARD's experience, that when WIROGUE
applies for immigration he will be required to give
(1) the name and address of his present employer and
probably the name of his supervisor and telephone number.
(2) what type of work he has been doing;
(3) proof that he will be able to support himself for
a minimum of two years at the rate of $125 a month.
(4) proof of his professional qualifications.
(5) birth certificate.
(6) detailed information regarding his employment and
residence addresses in the Georgian SSR
(7) details of the war-time military service.


S E C R E T
-2-
Case Officer said that early next week he will meet with
Wagner and Wills of the 513th and explain the above. If it
is possible he will get them to agree to provide the details
of (1) above in the event the Consulate should call as part
of the routine immigration processing. (2) above will be taken
care of in the same manner. Regarding (3), Headquarters has
given us authority to expend up to $3,000 and Case Officer will
513th of this. They will be asked to provide a letter
if required, stating that Subject has been associated with
them (whatever cover organization they wish to use) since his
defection in July 62 and has roughly $3,000 in salary and bonuses
being held for him. Regarding (4) whether or not is is adviseable
to provide Subject with proof of his professional qualifications
will be discussed with the 513th. (5) above, a birth certificate
will probably not be necessary since so many defectors do not
have these documents with them. Information on employment and
residences will be worked up by the Case Officer from past.
defector's BARs and with material available to SR 6. (6) above -
this information may also be acquired through facilities of SR 6.
After discussions with the 513th, Case Officer will tell
WIROGUE that we have been informed by Headquarters that if
Subject still desires to immigrate to South America and is
successful in immigrating, we have authority to provide financial
assistance during the transition period up to $125 a month.
Since Case Officer knows WIROGUE, the next question will be,
How long will I receive this $125 a month? Case Officer will
reply, Until you become satisfactorily established or we have


reason to believe that you are not sincerely trying to establish
yourself. Case Officer will tell him,
it were necessary.

Dear Mr. Sanders:
Just wanted to drop ou this line to tell you again how much I
enfoved our conversation the other evening at the Bahnhof. My greatest
experiences in Germany are the different people I meet, and it is always
very pleasant to talk with someone such as yourself who has such an
interesting background.
My friend felt rather silly at his attempted joke. The next time
he either will have less to drink or will think more before alowning!
It would be a pleasure to see you arain durin- my tour of duty
in Prankfurt. Maybe if you have a free hour or so in the future you
would want to have another supper in the Bahnhof!

Case Office:
COMMENTS:
Case Officer dropped by to see Subject and pay him assistance for
the week: He was advised that our legal department would possibly
recommend a patent attorney if and when he needed one He readily that
he already had had an attorney recommended to him by a contact head
made during the course of developing his invention: Case Office asked
his for the names of the contacts which he had made and he gave Case
Officer the following information:
He said he has made the acquaintance of a salesman representative
for the case factories specializing in small electrical devices. The mans
name is Will be not a patent address is Frankfurt/Main, an Tiergarten 52,
telephone 492251. Subject said that this person had recommended a patent
attorney by the name of Wilhelm Reichel, a Dr. Ing. Patentenmark, Frankfurt/Main,
Parkstr. 13, telephone 559165.
Subject told Case Officer that if he is lucky and his invention is
successful prior to any definite arrangements we make for his immigration
to South America, he will leave our custody and probably stay right here
in:Frankfurt. He said that he is aware he has committed himself to go to
South America and will do so but all that he wishes to do if immediate
situation of his motion is not forthcoming, is to get a patent on his
question so he cannot be given to the patent. He said.
Case Officer feels that this is about the best we can expect from
Subject. Case Officer has discussed this situation regarding the patent
with John Morrison of the legal staff, who says that he will at least try
to find out if this patent attorney is qualified and successful.
NOTE: Case Officer has learned that the patent laws in Germany are somewhat
peculiar in that a patent attorney is a technical qualified man who can
be used to make the patent. He said he has specialized and for which he
has received: a specialized education of the patent attorney in the case
that he can deal with any legal questions which arise in the patent
patent procedures or litigation in patent matters. Normally, an individual
who intends to get a patent will hire an attorney who will contact a patent
attorney. Between the two of them they can handle all problems and procedures
involving a patent. This also can be worked in reverse.

informing them as to the status of the object's documentation and propose
that steps be taken to begin Subject's processing for South America
Case Officer said that he had several ideas as to how this should be
done but in the final analysis would be to defer to Headquarters decision.
Subject asked if that meant he would be leaving soon. Case Officer
told him it was his opinion that he would still be here in December.
Subject seems extremely content and satisfied at

COMMENTS:
co. dropped by to see Subject and paid his his weekly subsistence. Subject
is happily engrossed in his latest invention and no longer seems impatient
to leave HARVARD hands. Case Officer told Subject that we had received
a new product. The product that the German authorities will issue him
a Reiseausweis. He was said. The new case Officer will notify
Headquarters that his documentation has been placed on his story
that he is a recent refugee. We will further advise them at unless
they have objections, we will start his processing for South America
possibly with the sponsorship of one of the refugee organiza
tions.
Subject agreed to this approach although Case Officer believes that
he is hoping he will succeed in making himself financially independent
by
one of his inventions. If this should happen, Case Officer
is sure that Subject will ask for his documentation and leave HARVARD
housing and go - his own.

CO dropped in to see Subject to tell his that we were now

Reiseauweis. He was told that we are making good progress acquiring
the information necessary for inigration and that soon he could
start his processing. Subject is so wrapped up in his inventions
that he seemed hardly to hear what CO was saying. CO sat him down
and went over the events leading up to the present; that he had come to
us. for a job and when that had not been forthcoming had stated that
his ambition was to be legalized and get citizenship by immigrating
to a SA country. He was reminded that that is what we are striving
to do but that we at this point are not sure how the imigration
will take place. He was told that Hidgtrs may require that he imigrato
on his own with us supplying the plane ticket and nothing; more or
he may possibly be helped by a refuçee organization. co said he did
not know if or what kind of financial assistance would be riven him.

COMMENTS:

originally proposed by CO since he does not have. sun. cigarette
tools and because some fiff of the parts #f must be offered
from the US: CO. encourages his as long as it keeps a special way
and helps to use the tobacco.
Subject has an extremely inventive mind and has
explained aeverl of his ideas to co. They would appear to
have cocercial value. Unfortunatà) Subject has neither the
money to develop thes nor is he it. a position to get involved
with patents or manufacturers at the present time.
He seems reasonably happy with his pronent status
but CO anticipates a bainy situation if upon applying for
immigration to a SA country, the processing period takes. long
time.

CONMENTS: co. picked up Subject and took him to lunch in the country
near Keu-Isenburg. Subject has been extremely. edgy lately and it
is not a very good example. The reading meal and 2 or 5 hours conversation
might have a. salubrious time.
CO mentioned to Subject that if be were interested we might
be able to find a radio or something along that time for him to
build. Subject was very enthusiastic succeeded that we get started
soconest.
Subject was dropped off at his apartment and co promised
to come by as soon as he could find something to occupy Subject's
time.
Subject was told that Haptra had suggested Argentine for
resettlement because they had no giotu restrictions and were in
need of technicians. Subject said that Argentine was out of the
question since he had acquaintances there who would be happy to
stir up any kind of trouble they possiblo could.
Subject suggests that he go to SA on a tourist via. According
to him, he said, "I think that he was a good person. According
immigration since he already would be there. This reason is quite
valid and sensible but CO knows that Subject has 2 quite different
reacans for making this suggestion. 1. With a tourist visa he has
been given to the finance him from country to country until
he finds exactly what he was a good person. The question is
a tourist visa he can return to Euro. is without having committed
hisself: irrevocably to inciguricat. statusith all it's attendant
responsibilities for settling the
make inquiries hiscelf at the. curious SA Consulates because he will
tell us only those details which he wants us to know and unfortunately
we hay eno way of checking since the Consulates will not give out
information re. immigration over the phone.
Then the time comes CO feels that we may be able to get the

Subject is a bit sceptical that #11 everything can be
backstopped but is willing to play hall. Al took some preliminary
informationfrom Subject and will discuss our problem with Camp King. CK
has indicated that they might be able to help us get Subject
resettled, particularly in Chile.
Subject is becoming extremely edgy and Harvard CO is
hoping that that this case will start moving soon.

WIROGUE, former REDSOX Agent Candidate and AF Division
Agent, has been outclclaimed and resettled on the local
economic. This dispatch covers the WIROGUE case from Nay 1962
to March 1964.
Subject arrived in FRANKFURT/MAIN on 22 May 1962 and
immediately made telephone contact with CABEZONE. He had
been guaranteed a meeting with a Fran KUBARK representative
who, he had been told, would explore KUBARK employment
process, and he was not a member of the KUBARK team would be attempting
to. market a telephone answering device which is a patented,
and conduct an investigation into the disappearance of 30
million francs which had been misappropriated by members of
the Congolase Defense Ministry KUBARK's reasons for establish-
ment of the KUBARK's business, but by the need to relieve
Subject of his KUBARK supplied fairly. The support in the
name/ of Reiner, the need to institute or suggest a course of
action which would encourage him to establish himself as a
contributing member of society and, above all, the
return to the Congo.
Subject was met by Stephen R. LACKEN and Roscoe MONT
and the President of the House. He was relieved of his documents
under the pretext that they were to be photographed and he
would not need them for the time being since he would be given
an identity -document for use during the period of time he would
be in KUBARK custody. LACKEN explained that as an administrative
officer he was interested only in taking care of his immediate
needs but soon however he would be introduced to one who's
business would be to work with him in an attempt to resolve his
problems.
Since it had been decided that Subject was primarily a
resettlement problem, Orme K. DARONNAT of HARVARD was
introduced to Subject. DARONNAT told Subject that he would be
awaiting with him during his stay in Frankfurt while we were
awaiting the Committee. He was a member of the KUBARK by
the Government. Subject stated that his greatestish was by
work for the "Company". If this was not to be, he hoped he
would.be helped to legalize and immigrate to South America.
He emphasized his obligation to complete his mission for the
C.D.F. and claimed also he had to return to the Congo to
the Congo. He said that it we decided to employ him. C. o.
told him our first order of business was to establish the need
for his services and in the meantime he could attempt to
market his invention.

HARVARD needed time to establish Headouterters interest
in the amount and type of assistance Subject should be given.
Also he was still an unknown quantity, restless and from
early cable traffic a potential troublemaker. In view of these
orderations we were anxious to make his stay in Frankfurt
reasoning. The procedure his desire to return to the
Congo; therefore, he was provided with subsistence and
confortable quarters.
DARONNAT introduced David E. COULLIARD (UKTOPAZ) explain-
ing to Subject that we would be wise to discuss the attention
for him since a long time might elapse before we had been
answer to Subject's possible employment with us and if the
subject would be should be prepared to take steps to
legalize him. COULLIARD, and the merits of a Fremdenpass
and a Reiseausweis, i.e. a Fremdenpass, and a
without much difficulty but control and security would be
limited to the time Subject remained registered at the place
at the time of the basis was issued. Therefore, the
Fremdenpass might well be a common unless Subject
could get an immigration visa to desired counters. He
ment in a short time. On the other hand the issuance of a
Reiseausweis could completely legalize Subject, but would
be a very difficult way. The failure false deflection story and
should not be done unless absolute and indirect. The
stated that he hated Germans and no matter what happened would
not stay in Germany. He suggested that he be helped to
be able to be able to make a Media, England, Australia, etc. C. o.
told him that with his criminal action. He has reported
imprisonment in France immigration to other countries.
of the question and even this was in doubt. He stated if
KUDARK employment was not possible he would hope to get legal
documentation in the name of de Panaskhet (his brother's
name) and the legal residence somewhere.
This time (one of the second C.O. had an inkling that
Subject was not eager to heart. He said, he said, he said, surmised
that his nuisance value might be such that he could parlay his
position into something better. HARVARD C.O. felt that
Subject's dislike for the Germans was real but was emphasized
that he had been benefit as much as possible from a
prolongation of his own opinion with KUBARK. He also
stated that he was willing to discontinue to responsibility
to the Congolese by mail, thereby confirming C.O.'s suspicion
that he did not in fact want to return to the Congo and was
only interested in prolonging his stay in FF/M and benefiting
therefrom.

In July 1962 Headquarters advised HARVARD to provide
Subject with resettlement, assistance including help in
immigrating to South America. Consequently, he was told
that though we appreciated his past service the economy
drive to the industry. He was asked employing him in any capacity.
He was bld that we were audited to help him realize his
stated desire to immigrate to S.A. and he was a
able to "wave a magic wand" and have him settled there with
the money they future. He was told we would help him in
whatever are necessary but he would be expected to apply
himself to the problem and drop all plans to return to the
Gonce.
Subject at this point was so discouraged by his inability
to sell! He invention; the realization that his services were
not needed by KUBARK and weeks of inactivity that he willingly
agreed to forego returning to the longage and give up all
documentation in the name of. Reiner of something could be
done to give him hope for the future.
Headquarters had recommended that Subject be resettled on
the following: "In apped-Fremdenpass; however, Clarance
W. LEIBROCK (NKTOPAZ) and DARONNA T after much discussion of
the relative merits of the new documentation available,
decided that only a Reiseausweis would be a new product

would be there was no guarantee Subject would be going to
South America. He said, he was here required to stay in

provide him with complete FEDREP recognition procedures
and the in a Reiseausweis. A subsequent discussion with
ODEREP is the confirmed this reasoning and, with the
concurrence of Acting Conferences, Subject was briefed by
Camp King representatives and the other of the political
recognition. He received political recognition on the basis
of a fabricated story in which he purported to be预期
who defected from East Berlin while with a tourist
HARVARD felt that progress was now being made but a
method of a simulated from a query initiated in December
1962 by CAVATA to OCS and the Confriger Bonn requesting full
traces; interrogation records for information available
on Subject. David R. REINBOLD of HARVARD, a member
cable and in a subsequent visit to Bonn that Subject's name,
George SANDERS, story submitted for recognition, etc. were
complete fabrications to insure that WIROGUE received political
recognition and a Reiseausweis. It was explained that WIROGUE

was strictly a HARVARD agent resettlement case of no AIS op
interest and not a routine CABEZONE case. OCA stated that
the political recognition interview story had naturally drawn
the interest and attention of CAVATA.
OCA
advised REINBOLD that CAVATA would be kept out of the case
by being told Subject was of continuing AIS ops interest and
HARVARD could go about its resettlement efforts.
Subject by this time had agreed to immigrate to any
South American country with the exception of Argentina, where
he claimed he had acquaintances who were not kindly disposed
to have been at Subject suggested that he go on a
tourist visa and apposting the right to be a very difficult
Although this suggestion was quite sensible and valid DARNONAT
knew that his reasons were: 1) with a tourist visa, he had
visions of having NUBARK finance him from country to country
and found exactly what would please him, and 2) he knew
that with a new visa he could return to Europe without
having committed him until irrevocably to immigration status
with all its attendant.
Available South American immigration data indicated that
a prospective immigrant would have to have personal qualifications
sufficient to make him an attractive prospect plus proof of
financial solvency sufficient to provide self-support at the
rate of $125 per month for two years. Headquarters approved
the new candidate of $3,000-for this purpose and discussions
with MOPAZ and Camp King resolved the necessary documentation
problems.
Fully documented and armed with the assurance that there
would be financial assistance available during his first
months in South America, Subject applied at the local Colombian
Consulate for permission to immigrate. HARVARD had hoped that
the U.S. Department of the Department of recommendation would be
sufficient to enable. Subject, to the reasons with a minimum of red
tape. This was not to be. and Subject was informed he could
only immigrate by processing through the intergovernmental
Committee for European Migration (ICEM).
This problem was discussed with a cleared official from
Refugee Migration Section AMCONGEN, Munich, and the Chief of
CAMPNTILLA. HARVARD was informed that European refugees
immigrating to South America are processed through ICEM thereby
eliminating the need for individual countries to maintain
immigration offices and welfare staffs. Unfortunately, since

ICEM is responsible for the immigration processing, it is

interviews and job testing to all prospective immigrants.
By now it was apparent that if the disappointments and
frustrations connected with this case were ever to end a
reappraisal of the American American whether or not to go ahead

be the most important, we can CAMENTILLA a party to fraud
with the danger of poverty. The missing embarrassment to KUBARK,
ODIBEX and to the Federal Republic of America, and
the aforementioned risks were worth taking and the problems
worth trying to resolve when it was obvious to HARVARD C.O.
and the United States did get to South America and became disenchanted,
his first stop, would be the local U.S. Consultate or Embassy
where he would ask to see the KUBARK representative and once
again force KUBARK to come directly involved in his personal
problems.
The use of the hundreds of hours of Case Officer time, the
many discussions (blessesare to pull together adequate information
regarding immigration, etc. in KUBARK was faced with the realiza-
tion that to prepare Subject for the United States, immigration
could take many more months. We were faced with the fact that
until Subject was provided with a detailed life history
containing the information required by prospective employers
to be used to be taken as a means not in a position to be
restedly anywhere, let alone South America knew a new
approach would have to be tried if HARVARD was not in a
a position to satisfactorily sever Subject's dependence upon
the United States, immigration the need for future contacts.
HARVARD C.O. felt that Suburban should be told outright that
immigration to South America was a challenge to be under the
present circumstances and what would be done, would be to
provide him with a detailed life history with the U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U.

DARONNA told Subject that any South American immigration

1941 - 1946
Army Service
1946 - 1962
Mikha Tskhakaya, Ulitsa Shota Rustaveli,
(until defection)
#25, the private home of my common-lap
wife, Nina GANDELI. I was in love with
her and had an affair with her before
I went to war. During the war, I found
that the most husband was killed in
action and decided to live to Tskhakaya
to be near her: I moved in with
and continued to live with her without
registering our marriage at the local
regional registrar office for marriage;
deaths, the family and though I insisted
on legalizing our union. Nina was always
opposed, being unhappy 13 first
marriage, and wanted to feel free to end
the relationship at any time.
For the last several years Nina, as I
found out, was meeting other men during
the last year, I had been. A rift between
us developed and grew up. I had with
the passing of time. Being deprived of
Nina's intimacy, I reacted by dating other
girls. We were on the verge of separation
and the same time. I had been. I tried
desperately to resolve our problem. Since,
when I still was very close to Nina,
made anti-regime remarks on several
years. I had even planned a joint escape
from the USSR.
In the same time, I was have
her too much in order not to push her into
possibly reporting me to the militia.
However, for some reason Nina did not
be able to have the right completely,
and one day announced that the expect-
ing a child and wanted to legalize our
marriage. Since, I did not consider
myself the father of the child and
fearing black-mail by Nina, I decided to
speed up my defection which I was planning
anyway.

21. HISTORY OF ARRESTS:
In June 1962, I was approached by the rayon militia at my
place of work and was taken to the militia offices where
I was accused of being a long standing member of a
Georgian resistance group and of making anti-government
of the military forces. He was a senior president of the
occasions and was therefore guilty of the latter charge; I
noticed that the militia did not have sufficient information
on this subject and I denied all accusations. I could not
be aware of the problem of the report. After prolonged
interrogation, during which he was asked to be asked on
my biography, parents, army service, contacts, etc., I was
released with the warning that I was not to leave the
area for the time being and that I would be contacted in the
near future by the militia. Except for this case, I was
never arrested or detained by militia or security organs.
22. MEMBERSHIP IN POLITICAL PARTIES OR ORGANIZATIONS:
I never belonged to the Communist Party. I was urged to
join the Komsomol in 1937 while at the Tbilisi Elektro-
Technicum, and was sponsored there by two of my class-mates,
each of whom had more than two years of Komsomol standing.
I have been the most important role in the military forces
(cell) and at a general meeting of the cell members my
application was discussed and I told my life story and answered
questions put to me by the members. After I was accepted,
I would be asked to help card in about two months from the
city rayon committee of the military forces. I would be
I had to attend meetings and pay very small dues. I never
held any official position with the Komsomol organization.
When I left Tbilisi, I had to deregister from the Tbilisi
Eck, I would be asked to help the military forces organization at my
new place of residence in Mikha Tskhakaya. I would be
to by the local population simply as 'Tskhakaya'). The same
procedure had to be repeated upon my departure to and
discharge from the army (deregistration from the old
organization and registration at the new place). Upon my
time, I am for the army to Tskhakaya, I never registered with
the organization.
When I started to work in Tskhakaya, I was automatically
enrolled in the prof-soyuz (trade unions) where I was a
passive member paying my dues (something like 1% of my salary)
to the trade union organizer of MTS (prof-org) and attending
the obligatory meetings from time to time. I never took
any advantage of trade union members privileges such as the
cut-rate accommodations in rest homes (putevka v dom otdykha).

23. CONNECTIONS WITH ANY INTELLIGENCE SERVICES:
I never had any contacts with intelligence services. I was
never approached to serve in any capacity for Soviet security
organs.
24. DEECTION AND-ESCAPE:
A. MOTIVATION:
In spite of being born and raised in a Communist country,
the U.S. government, "began to understand that real freedom
did not exist for the individual. It also clear to
me that personal advancement did not depend on the
integrity but on the degree of one's political activity.
I analyzed the Communist lies seeing reality: so different
from the official propaganda. During and after the war,
the U.S. government has been countries and was able
to benefit from the particles of the U.S. government
life there from the even sometimes very carefully worded
reports of those people. After I purchased a good radio
station, I had 56, I started to listen intensively to
foreign broadcasts, and I had a positive activated the
idea of eventual escape from the USSR where the
relatives, no family, no possibilities for advancement
and sent life. My anti-government sentiments which
developed the U.S. government for stronger and stronger,
and it became more and more diffuser to me to hold
myself back and not to express them upon which I did
anyway on several occasions. My involvement with the
militia and the unfavorable developments if my personal
life accelerated my plans for defection.
B. TECHNIQUES OF ESCAPE:
On 25 June 1962, three days after my experience with the
militia, I left my residence at 0700 as I normally would
to go to work. I walked out of town toward Santredia.
And my regular clothing, had 80 rubles and a small
hand, and a little bit of time. I had a train being afraid
of militia surveillance. After I walked at the three kilo-
meters on the highway, I got a ride on a truck from the
near-by collective farm which was headed in the same
direction. I got off the truck downtown in Santredia and
paid the driver one ruble, then walked toward the railroad
station. Here I purchased the ticket for Batumi and
background the train at 1150 arriving in Batumi at 1415. I


found a safe place and slept until dark. I started off
on foot from Batuni and following the sea shore until I
reached the old shooting range about 1/2 or 2 km to
the south. Here I entered the water about 2200 hours;
after destroying my passport (the rest of the patents,
the first at home) and burying my clothing and bags.
knew from the first and second, map. at home that I had to
swim some 18 km, to Turkish and the 18 km. swam all night
and was not sure if I had reached Turkish and the 18 km.
being exhausted, I came ashore at about 0300 or 0400 hours.
The 18 km is stepped out was on the gradient of a
steep slope. There was a lot the silhouette of a hut and
went in. There was an old, most electric motor in
the hut. From the Russian description of the 18 km
underbrush that I was still in Russia. I hid in the
underbrush and spent the rest of the night and
the following day the head was hit was getting dark, I
climbed the slope to observe the 18 km. I walked for a
while hearing voices in Russian coming from the
1 continued back object on the sea which resembled a submarine.
2300 hours I entered the shore and around 2200 or
off shore and then parallel to and started to swim 3 km
range of a search light which swept the 18 km. I came into the
hand, and I had surface the search light swept over me
but nothing happened. I knew I had not been discovered.
I continued to swim until I had already exhausted, and
several hours before dawn went ashore along the a cave
remained there being rocks in the sea near the shore.
up the slope where I saw a wind, The next morning I climbed
grave. I went in and observed the structure resembling a
trapped wing. I saw a large village which I later formed
was Kemal-ning. I thought at first that a minaret was
an observation tower. I was presumed that this was the
village of Sarpi, still on Soya, I had to tell I was very
thirsty and climbed down the hill to a near-by- and to
the 18 km. I met an 11 or 12 year old boy whom I
addressed in Russe. I had to be boy drew away from me. Being
still not sure as to where the wind is the stream
for a while to hide my footprints. The wind is the
underbrush until it grew dark. I came out and went around
the 18 km. The opposite end. There I entered the town
and knocked on the door of a house situated on a hillside.
I called out in this main. Even though I heard voices and
footsteps in the fashion, I opened the door. I climbed
on the roof of a sort of study in the courtyard and spent
the night there. Early next morning I was awakened by

noises in the courtyard. I saw several women and two
men. I approached them and tried to make time under-
stand by sign language that I had come from Russia.
I said some persons carrying sticks and axes came
into the course of the machine. I said I had a great I came
from-Russia and wanted to remain in Turkey. The most
took me to the military authorities in Kemal-Pasha,
When I dived into the sea in Batumi, I was wearing swimming
trunks, a belt and a pair of fins. There was a clasp
knife in my belt, a sack needle for stinging myself in
case of a cramp, my money in a nylon bag, three bars of
chocolate, a compass and two Phenamin tablets to increase
the amount of separate nylon bag. Except for the
occasional search light in the sea, which I avoided by
diving, I did not encounter any other obstacles on my way.
I did not inform anybody about my escape plans and did not
receive any help from anybody.
From Kemal-Pasha where I was given some clothing, I was
taken by car to Erzerum and from there by train to
Istanbul refugee center. I was there about a week and
was taken to Germany with the assistance of US authorities
on Friday 6 July 1962.
25 DOCUMENTS:
A. PASSPORT:
I received my first three-year passport at #17 militia
(passport desk) office of Molotovsky rayon of Tbilisi,
where I resided at that time. The passport was a single
sheet of paper with my photo and biographic data on it.
In 1939 I exchanged it for a new five-year passport at
#17 militia, I had been the same in the same form of
a regular booklet form and along with my photo and bio
data, had a stamp of propiska (registration with militia)
which stated the date of my arrival in this town and my
residence address. When I was drafted to the army, I
were a very good candidate for the first year. I had
rayovgenkomat, and picked it up upon discharge from the
service. At that time I received a new five-year passport
from the same militia office with the propiska showing
my new address. In 1951, I exchanged my passport for the
new one which was valid for 10 years and which was
exchanged for another 10-year passport in 1961.

COMPENTS:
Doral
Case Officer and
introduced as Mr. Joseph LORTON, went to
see Subject with the express purpose of discussing the various possibilities
that might be available to document Subject-as legally as possible.
Subject told CO that he had made contact in Department under the name of
de. Panashbet. with a firm that was interest in the United States. The
him that since he did not have a patent this would pose a problem and offered
him 5,000 DM for his idea. Subject told them he would give it to them outright
for $10,000. Although they did not refuse his request, they told him they
would think it over and discuss it with the boss and would have to make a
patent search which would take up to a weeks. Subject told them to go ahead
to the committee. The committee was given these were ways of proving
that the idea was his and he could offer it to other firms. Subject will
now wait to be contacted by this firm.
Case Officer told Subject that we had not heard anything from Headquarters
regarding his re-employment by us. He asked if there was some way of finding
out approximately how long it would take. CO told his this was very difficult,
but we would see if we could make an educated guess.
Subject asked for a key to the mailbox since he will be receiving mail
from his friends in Dortmund and possibly from the firm which he has contacted.
then began discussing documentation with Subject along the following
lines:
The type of documentation he would receive if any would depend upon the
final decision from Headquarters as yet not received. We solicited suggestions
from Subject as to solutions to the documentation problem. Apparently his
immediate desire is to receive back his Australian pass, finish his business
in Europe and return to the Congo to clean up matters there.


The other or long-range alternative would have to have

ORME K. DARONNAT
Case Officer
COMENWIS:
LACKLEN introduced DAIORNAI at S. Mr. Murmann and explained
that he would now be working with Subject. On the way to
lunch DARONNAT explained that he and Subject would be working
together to resolve whatever problems Subject, but the
During lunch, conversation was limited mostly to Subject's
views on the Congo situation and the solutions. He also
expounded at great lengths on the of the Congolc& and
the Belgians whom he would appear to dislike intensely.
The question to the apartment Subject was told that we
would like to get the same information documentation with political
recognition. He was told that that he was still he would be
documented as legally as possible under the circuncting of the
would be in a position to begin a new life. Subject was very
sufficiently. It is not practical-that we could accomplish this. He
was asked to think that the subject has desire to use the name
David de Panaskhet since, if he was not a smoking parot
in France, there could be a watch list for that name.
The subject was handed that since Panaskhet was his brother's name,
subject might be the same some day. Subject stated that
someone was confused about the presence, that he was
not on parol and had, therefore, not done. The question was
leaving the country. He said that the worst that could happen
if he returned there would be for the authorities to ask him why
he had left the town he had been confined to. His answer would
be to chance they had restricted his movements he had left the
country (c. 0. doubts that this is true but good not raise any
questions):
Subject was given a DRC identity card, number 506, in the
name of David de Panaskhet. Since HARVARD is awaiting Headquarters
proposa31 regarding Subject's resettlement, C. 0. suggested that
he investigate the possibility of marketing his telephone
answering device.

nothing about this: LACKLEN said that certainly with the large numbers
of refugees that have come to West Germany in the past 15 years, three
must be some means or getting documentation. LACKLEN said if WIRGUE
would = officially ask him for German recognition that he would forward
this request to Washington. LACKLEN made it very clear that we here in
the same way. He said, "I think, he could do nothing on this matter or make
another move on this case until all other from Washington. WIRGUE said
he clearly understood this and asked for German documentation in exchange
for his Austrian passport, etc.
5. Later in the conversation WIRGUE mentioned he had a moral obligation
to carry out his assignment for the Congolgee army here in Europe and
said he must give them some information by尚al vithing three weeks. LACKLEN
asked WIRGUE how would a German recognition affect his dealing with the
warring of the German recognition that is�: return to the Congo for two or three
days to conclude his contract with them. He would require his Austrian
paseport for this.
6. Throughout the conversation MIRGUE used the words; if the
service does not have anything for me." It is LACKLEN of opinion that
WIRGUE believes it quite possible that KUBARK may not have an assignment
for him and that if we can provide him with usable recognition documentation
he might be effectively terminated. The one problem still unclear, however,
when he has been meant not to return to the Congo. The matter that
we retain his Austrian peasant will prevent him from returning to the Congo,
but it will be very desirable to find a plausible reason by which we can
make him see he must not return to the Congo.
7. LACKLEN requested and WIRGUE agreed to remain in the a apartment
until the pass could be obtained. LACKLEN arranged for a maid to come in
and cook his meals. French magazines were provided. It is believed he will
be content in the apartment through 24 May.
8. Throughout the meeting WIRGUE continually wentoktaku expressed
his views on the Congo, documentation procedures and techniques, etc.
LACKLEN suggested that he had very useful information that might be of
the same time. The message fields and asked if he would be agreeable
to talking with someone. WIRGUE is the most important factor of the
LACKLEN made this pitch as a contingency by which we might tie up WIRGUE
for several days in t "important" debriefings and delay kix his pressing
for an immediate solution. We might also describe delays as being caused
by the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact is very
familiar with. During these debriefings it would be possible also to
the extent fo his knowlegeability of KUBARK operations, personalities, etc.
LACKLEN believes WIRGUE has quite an extensive knowledge of KUBARK. He
has been handled by many people, in many places and in many ways.


9. Cucuring WIRQUE'S present that we ask Washington approval to
explore the possibility of obtaining German recognition for him, he requested
that 17 documentation could be obtained he would like it in the name of
"David De Punschhot'. He said this was his brecher's legal name in France.
WIRQUE suggested also that the documents of the U.S. also known
previously as "David Tefitzchvili" which is his real and true name from
birth.
10. WIRQUE continued to show a complete satisfaction and contentant
with our handling of his case. so far. LACKLEN reiterated that we were
calling along as rapidly as possible and would make every effort to get
a good way to make the "DAR" and "DARK" substantiate our desires to

of the Liefunkin; Grundig and other electric factory. He said he
where he might sell his invention: WIRQUE said he would appreciate this,
but that he also had letters of introduction to several firms in Dortmund
and Dusseldorf. At the conclusion of the meeting, LACKLEN assumed up the
timetable for action as follow:
a. MOKEH would return at about 1400 today to take needed
the "DAR" and "DARK" length in case French reading material.
WIRQUE WIRQUE appearing in in the apartment until
such a pass was available in the 19th century. He lost to
get it by 1700 today, but if not, early on 24 May.
b. When a pass was available WIRQUE could work out arrangements
to go to Entemment Dortmund, etc., however, it may be that his
debriefing on the Congo, on documentation, etc. was of sufficient
importance that he should be diversified immediately.
c. To make his stay in the apartment as comfortably.
he should suggest to the maid the types of roads be particularly
enjoys.
d. We vould continue to press Washington for authority needed to
resolve his case.
11. WIRQUE undertactod the program and was quite satisfied. He is
cooperative and LACKLEN believes will continue to be so as long as a
logical and plausible program is presented. LACKLEN's next contract with
WIRQUE will be by telephone at 1700 hours on 23 May when he will tell
him the pass is not ready and arrange for another contact as 1030 hours
on 24 May.

Während der letzten-Jahre unseres Zusammenlebens fand
ich heraus, dass Nina Beziehungen zu anderen Mannern

das Zusammenleben wurde untergräglich. Dann erwärterte
sie ein Kind und da ich sicher war, dass es nicht mein

lich ertichtigtt. Der Unterricht dauerte von September bis
Juli. Die Sommerferien verbrachte ich gewöhnlich auf einem
Kolchos mit einer Gruppe,die vom Technikum organisiert wor-
den war, um den Bauern mit der Ernte zu helfen.
Die Prüfungen fanden zwei mal im Jahre statt, vor dem Jahres-
ende und am Ende eines zweiten Semesters. Noten wurden nach
dem folgenden System gegeben:


-7-
5 - Otilitschno. (sehr gut)
4 - Choroscho. (gut)
3 - Posredstwemo (gentigend)
2 - Plocho. (schledt)
1 - Otschen plocho (senn schieds)
Die ersten drei Noten waren notwendig um versetzt zu werden.
Im Frühling 1938 hatte ich Abschlussprüfungen, mindlich und
schriftlich und ich bekam ein Diplom ausgehändigt. Das Zeug-
nis war.eine Seite lang und brachte zum Ausdruck, dass ich
das Technikrum 4 Jahre lang besucht hatte. Es enthleit die No-
ten für alle Gegenstinde und zeigte, dass ich als electro-
mechanic ausgebildet worden war.
Allen Prüflingen wurden verschiedene Arbeitsplätze zugewiesen
an denen sie mindestens zwei Jahre zu verbleiben hatten. Das
ist eine Art von Rückzahlung des Geldes, das die Regierung für
die Ausbildung ausgegeben hatte. Ich wurde MICHA-ZCHAKAJA
M.T.S. zugewiesen; der Name wurde 1958 in R.T.S. abgewandelt.
17. BERUPLICHER WERDEGANG:
1938-1941 und 1946-bis zur Flucht MICHA ZCHAKAJA M.T.S.
(Maschinen-Traktoren-Station), später abgewandelt in R.T.S.
(Reparatur-Technische-Station) ( ( Matchino-Traktornaja und bzw.
Remontno- Technitscheskaja Stanzija ). MICHA-ZCHAKAJA wurde von
der Bevölkerung einfach Zchakaja genannt und war Rayon-Zentrum
des Zchakajskii Rayon, so genannt nach dem berühmten georgischen
Revolutionär MICHA ZCHAKAJA (( der alte Name der Stadt war
ACHAL -SENAKI bezw. ACHAL - SENAKSKII Rayon ). M. Zchakaja war
einer der Organisatoren der georgischen komrunistischen Partei,

Die Stadt hat gegenkritig ungefähr 10,000 Einwohrer und be-
findet sich an der Eisenbahnstrecke Samtredia-Suchum1 ( die
Hauptstrecke zwischen Tbilisi und Koskau mit Abweigungen nach
Poti, dem Badoort am Schwarzen Meer. Die Stadt liegt zwischen
zwei Zufüssen des Rion Plusses: Tisii und Terachi. Am Letzteren
liegt ein paar Kilometer von M. ZOKAKAJA entfernt ein kleines
Elektrizitätswerk wo ich nach meiner Rückkehr aus dem II. Welt-
Krieg zeitweilig arbeitete. Bei W.T.S. ( welche 1958 in R.T.S.
umbenannt wurde nachdem die Einrichtungen und Maschinen den
lokalen Getreide-und Trauben- erzeugenden Kolchesen zugeleilt
worden waren und als einzige Verantwortung die Reparatur die-
ser Maschinen mit R.T.S. verbliet). Tich wurde bald Vorarbeitet
einer Gruppe von Elektro-Mechanikern, die für die Pflege und
die Reparaturen der elektrischen Teile von landwirtschaftlichen
und anderen Maschinen verantwortlich waren. Kein Anfangsgehalt
war 400 oder 500 Rubel, sberge stieg schnell und als ich in die
Armee einberufen wurde war mein Gehalt schon fast doppelt so
hoch.
Aus persönlichen Gründen kehrte ich in diese Stadt zurück, nach+
dem ich aus dem Kilitärdienst entlassen worden war und ich er-
hielt meine alte Stellung wieder. Ich bekam dazu noch eine
Stelle als Elektro-Techniker mit dem vorher erwähnten Elektri-
zitätswerk, welches Elektrizität für die Stadt und dem thirigen
Rayon erzeugte. Ich erhielt diese Stelle zugewiesen, da nach
den Krieg ein Mangel an qualifizierten Arbeitskräften bestand.
Ich arbeitete in der zweiten Schicht im Elektrizitätswerk von
1947-1953 ( dann wurde die Stelle von einem jungen Absolventen
des Kutaisi Techrikums gefüllt). Ich verdiente dort 700 Rubel
neben meinem Grundgehalt bei R.T.S. Vor meiner Flucht war mein
Einkommen ungefähr 120 neue Rubel Brutto. Ich hate zusätzliches
Einkommen von Wochenend-irbeiten für die Reparatur von Haushalt
gegenständen,Radios usw. durch Einwohrer der Stadt. Das Geld war
1961 10 zu 1 abgewertet waden.

MILITARISCHER WERDEGANG
A.
REGISTRIERUNG FUR MILITARDIENST: Im Sommer 1939
wurde ich von meinem rayor-wojenkomat ( Rekrutierungs-
stelle) benachrichtigt, dass ich mich an einem bestimm-
ten Tag dort einzufinden habe ; von dort ging es mit
einer Gruppe anderer. zukünftiger Rekruten zu der rayon
polyclinic für die medizinische Untersuchung. Ich habe
den linken Daumen und Zeitgefinger bis zum ersten Glied
durch einen Arbeitsunfall verloren und als dies dem Re-
krutierungsstelle mitgeteilt wurde, wurde ich fur den
aktiven Dienst als ungeeignet erklärt und der Besser
zugewiesen. Zu demalen Zeitpunkt wurde mein pripienoje
widetelstwo ( Registrierungs-Dokument ) für ein Sold-
buch ausgetauscht.
B. ENZIEHUNGSTAG: Ungeführ am 26 August 1941 wurde
ich aufgefordert mich am 27. August beim raywojenkomat
zu melden. Ich tat das und wurde aufgefordert mich zum
Dienst am folgenden Tag zu melden. Mit einer Gruppe von
ungefähr 80 bis 100 Rekruten meines Rayons fuhren mir mit
dem Zug von Thilisi nach Baku, wo die Gruppe in der so-
genannten Saljanskije Kaaparmi ( S. Kaserne ) untergebracht
vurde, die sich am Stadtrand von Baku, auf der Strasse
nach Saljani und zur iranischen Grenze, befand.
C. militärische EINHEIT und ENKENNUNGSNUMMER: Ich diente
bei der Luftabwehr Artillerie. Eine Erkennungsnummer hat
es bei der sowjetischen Armee nicht gegeben.
D. GRUNDAUBILDUNG: Meine erste militärische Ausbildung
erhielt ich in der Saljani Kaserne in Baku und sie dauerte
zwei Monate. Einen Monat reguläre Grundausbildung und im
zweiten Monat verbesserte ich meine Qualifikation als
Autofahrer ( Ich hätte gelehnt wie man einen Wagen fährt
während ich in der M.T.S. die elektrischen Reparaturen


- 10 -
an Autos durchführte. Ich-weiss die Nimmer der Finheit
nicht mehr in der ich meine Grundausbildung erhieht. Zu
diesem Zeitpunkt waren die Kassernen überfüllt, meistens
Solänen der Infantrie und Artillerie die iriner wieder
abgelöst wurden.
E. SPEZIALAUSBLIDUNG: Einen Monat Pahrschle wie oben
erwähnt.
P. RESERVE ZUCCHORIGETT :
Sommer 1939:
Aus Gesundheitscründen untauchlich
für aktiven Diert und der Reserve
zuge teilt.
Herbst 1946:
Aus der Armee entlassen-pachdem
ich meine Reise und Entlassungs-
papiere meinen Pajwojenkomat über-
geben hatte erhielt ich ein neues
Soldbuch welches meine Reserve Zu-
gehörigkeit enttielt. Ich wurde nie
mehr einberufen der zur irgendeiner
Ubung eingezogen nachdem ich von
meinem Militärdienst entlassen
worden war.
G. CHRONOLOGISCHE AUFZEICHNUNG MEINES MILITZEDENSTES:
Mit einer Gruppe anderer Rekruten wurde ich mit dem Zug zu
der 253. Separaten Luftabwehr Artilleeie Division, 2. Batterie,
gebracht ( OSAD- ogne-ssschtschitnyi artilleriski division ).
Der konmandierende Offizier der Batterie war Leutnant WAKS.
Kommandant der wswod uprawlenje ( Verwaltung, Zugsführer )
der Division war Leutnant ENDELADE. Stellverretender Divi-
sionskormandant für politische Belange war Hauptmann TSCHOCHA
und politruk meiner Batterie war Senior Leutnst: SAMARIN.
Major Wlado ( Wladieir) GURGENIDES war konmandierender Offizier
von OSAD und im Februar 1943 wurde er auch zum Sommandeur von


- 11 -
PRO ( protivo- wosdischnaja oborona) ( Luftscutz ) für die
Stadt Michurinsx ernannt: Das Hauptquartier der Division war
in Michurinsk, während die Batterie in der Nache der Station
TARASOWO bei der. Stedlung Konskaje, 7 km von Kichurinsk und
6 km von den 6 errichteten Gehenge! bei Kochetowa ( 'Station
146. Ein hohes Hauptquartier war in Tarnbow und wurde erat von
Obert STOBERNÄSCH und später von Obersst 2020W, einem de-
gradierten General komandiert,
Als ich zuerst in Michurinsk eintraf wurde ich erst als Last-
wegenfahrer dem Verpflegungszug der Division zugeeit! (chos-
wesod oder chossjästwennyi waswod ) konmäniert von Junior
Leutnänt MAKAROW. Später wurde ich mit dem oben erwähnten
ENDELADSS bekannt, ein Landsmann von mir und wurde durch sei-
nen Einfluss dem Divisions-Kommandeur GURG-NIDE, auch ein
Georgier der später zum Oberstleutnant befördert wurde, als
persönlicher Pahrer zugeteilt. Er behielt mich in dieser Po-
sition bis ich vom Miltärdienst ehtlassen wurde.
H.
BEFORDERUNGEN UND DEGRADIERUNGEN: Nach 6 Monaten Mili-
tärzeit wurde. ich zum jefrejtor ( Gefreiten ) befördert, am
Ende des ersten Jahres zum Unterfeldwebel und 1844 wurde ich
zum Feldwebel befördert
I.
AUSZEICHHUNGEN: keine
J.
ENTLASSUNGSTAG: Ich wurde vom aztiven Miltärdienst
Ende September 1546 entlassen. Ich erhielt meinen Pahrbefehl
und Reissegeld von mainer Einheit in Michurinsk, die ich spä-
ter dem rajwojenkomat übergab: 1955 wurde ich nochmals Arzt-
lich unteraucht, auf Befehl vom vojenkomat und ofiziell aus
meiner Reservestellung entlassen, aus Gesundheitsgrinden (so
wie zuvor) und erhielt eine sogenannte belji biel ( weisse

WOHNORTE SEIT GEBUERT:
1919-1926
verschiedene Adressen in Tbilisi
1926-1934
Tbilisi, Kirotschnaja U11sta.Nr. 35
eine Wohnung in einem 2-stückigen
Haus, welches frÜner privates Eigen-
tum war und später SHAKT (Staetliche
Häuserverwaltung) unterstand.Nach dem
Tode meiner Mutter trat ich in das
Elektio-Technikum ein, wo ich im Pensionat
war.
1934-1938
Tbilisi, U11sta Sowjetskaja ( Nummer
nicht in Erinnerung), Studentenheim des
Tbilisi Elektro-Technikums.
1938-1941
MICHA ZCHAKAJA, U11sta Tsulukidse Nr.14.
Hier mietete ich ein Zimmer in einem
privaten einstöckigem Haus, das einem
pensionierten Eisenbahn-Weichensteller,
Ilja LORDIPANIDSE, gehörte, welcher
ein Zimmer vermieten musste, um etwas
zu seiner Fension dazuzuverdienen. Ilja's
Frau Keto( Katherine ) kümmerte sich um
meine Wäsche und kochte für mich wofür
ich extra etwas bezahlte. Das Ehepaar.
hatte keine Kinder und behandelten mich
wie ihren eigenen Sohn.

Kilitärzeit
1946-1962
Micha Zchnakaja,U11sta Schota Rustaveli
(bis zur Plucht)
Nr. 25, die Privatwohnung meiner Gelieb-
ten. Nina GANBELI. Ich liebte sie und
hatte mit ihr ein Verhältnis bevor ich


-13-
in den Krieg ging. Während des Krieges
hörte ich; dass Nina's Mann in Krieg ge-
fallen war und ich entachloss mich nach
Zchakaja zurückzukehren um in ihrer Nähe
zu sein. Ich zo: zu Nina und lebte mit ihr
zuammen ohne unsere Heirat bei SAGS (He-
gistrierstelle von Geburten, Heiraten und
Sterberfülle) zu registrieren. Obwohl ich
erst darauf bestand unsere Verbindung zu
legalisieren.wollte Nina es nicht, da sie in
ihrer ersten Ehe unglikclich war; sie wollte
frei sein um die Verbindung jeder Zeit lösen
zu können.
Während der letzten Jahre fand ich heraus,
dass Nina sich withrend meiner Abwe senheit
von zu Hause mit anderen Männern traf. Un-
stimmigkeiten entstanden, die mehr und mehr
wuchsen als die Zeit verging. Nachdem das
Verhältnis mit Nina sehr fühl geworden war,
fing ich an mich mit anderen Prauen zu tref-
fen. Wir waren oft daran uns endgültig zu
trennen, aber wir fanden immer wieder zu-
sammen. Ich versuchte verzweifelt unser
Problem zu lösen,denn ich hatte zu einem
Zeitpunkt als wir uns noch sehr nahe waren
Bemerkungen gegen die Regierung gemacht und
ich plante sogar eine gemeinsame Flucht aus
den USSR. Ich wollte sie nicht zuehr ver-
tirgern um sie nicht womöglich dazu zu brin-
gen, dass sie mich bei der Militis anziohte.
Aber aus irgendwelchen Gründen wollte Nina
nicht gänzlich mit mir brechen und eines


- 14 -
Tages teilte sie mir mit, dass sie ein Kind
erwarte und dass sie unsere Heirat legalisieren
michte. Da ich mich aber nicht als der Vater
des Kindes betrachtete und da ich. Erpressung von
Ninas Seite fürchtete entschloss ich mich meine
Plucht, die ich ohnehin schon geplant hatte, zu
beschleunigen.
20.
REISEN:
Keine anderen als schon erwähnt.
21.
VERHAFTUNGEN:
Im Juni 1962 kam diehilitia zu mir und bracht mich von meinen
Arbeitsplatz zu ihrer Dienststelle wo ich beschuldigt wurde
ein langjähriges Mitglied einer georgischen Widerstandsgruppe
zu sein und regierungsfeindliche Ausserungen gemacht zu haben.
Obwohl ich solche Bemerkungen bei verschiedenen Gelegenheiten
gemacht hatte und deshalb schuldig im Sinne des letzteren Teils
der Anschuldigung war, konnte-ich fühlen, dass die Militia nicht
gentigend Informationen besass und ich verneinteähle Anschuldi-
gungen. Ich konnte mir nicht denken wer dahinter steckte. Nach
langen Verhören, bei denen ich über alle Einzelheiten meines
Lebens, Eltern, Militärdienst, Kontakte, u.s.w. befragt wurde,
wurde ich mit einer Warning entlassen das Gebiet nicht zu
verlassen und es wurde mir gesagt ich würde wieder von der
Militia hören. Kit dieser einigen Ausnahme bin ich nie ver-
haftet oder verhört worden, weder bei der Militia oder anderen
Sicherheitsbehörden.
22.
MITGIEDSCHAFT IN POLTISCHEN PARTEIEN ODER ORGANISATIONEN:
Ich gehörte niemals der kommunistischen Partei an. Mir wurde
nahe gelegt 1937 Konsomol beizutreten während ich am Tbilisi


-15-
Elektro-Technikum war. Dabei wurde von zwei Klassenkameraden
die Bürgschaft übernommen, jeder von den beider war schon
mehr als zwei Jahre Mitglied. Ich reichte mein Gesuch bei
der lokalen Komsomol jatschelka (Zelle) ein und bei einer
Zusammenkunft der Zellenmitglieder wurde mein Aufnahmege-
such besprochen, ich erzahlte meine Lebengeschichte und
beantwortete Pragen. Nachdem ich aufgenommen worden war
erhielt ich meine Mitgliedskarte in ungefähr zwei Monaten
vom Stadt-Rayon-Komittee des Thilisi Komsomol; darauf hin
besuchte ich Versammlungen und zahlte kleine Beitrag. Ich
hatte niemals eine offizielle Position bei Komomol. Als ich
Thilisi verliess musste ich mich von der Tbilisi Organisation
streichen lassen und mich am neuen Wohnort Micha Zehikaja
( bei der Bevölkerung gewhnlich nur "Zchakaja" genannt),
neu eintragen lassen. Dasselbe geschah als ich in die Armee
eintrat ( Austreichen aus der ülten Organisation und Ein-
schreiben am neuen Wohnort). Als ich nach der Entlassung von
der Armee wieder nach Zhakaja zurückkehrte liess ich mich
nicht wieder in die lokale Organisation eintragen.
Als ich in Zhakaja zu arbeiten begann wurde ich automatisch
in die (prof.-org) Gewerkschaft eingeschrieben, in der ich
ein passives Mitglied war, das seine Beiträge ( etwas wie
1% neines Gehaltes ) an den Organisator der Gewerkschaft
von MTS bezahlte und von Zeit zu Zeit einer Pflichtversamm-
lung beiwohnte. Ich machte nie Gebrauch von den Vorteilen
der Mitgliedschaft wie ermässigte Preise in Erholungsstütten
( putewka v dom otdicha ).
23.
VERBINDUNGEN MIT EINEM SICHERHEITSDIENST:
Ich hatte nie einen Kontakt mit einer Sicherheitsbehörde.
Ich wurde auch nie aufgefordert in irgendeiner Art für den
sowjetischen Sicherheitsdienst zu arbeiten.

FLUCHT
A.
GRUNDE:
Trotzdem. ich. in einem kommuunistischen Land geboren
und. erzogen worden war begann ich doch schon frühn-
zeitig zu verstehen, dass für die Einzelperson keine
Preiheit bestand. Es war mir auch klar, dass persön-
licher Aufstieg nicht von dem Talent und der Recht-
schaftenheit eines Menschen abhing, sondern von dem
Ausmass der politischen Betätigung, Ich sah durch die
kommunistischen Lügen, da die Wirklichkeit so verschie-
den von der offiziellen Propaganda war. Während und
nach dem Krieg truf ich Menschen die westliche Länder
besucht hatten und ich war in der Lage Bruchstücke
der Wahrheit über den Unterschied in den Lebensarten
aus diesen Erzählungen abzuleiten, obwohl diese Be-
richte sehr vorsichtig vorgebracht wur an. Nachdem ich
1956 ein gutes Radio der "Mir" Marke kaufte hörte ich
sehr oft ausländischen Stationen zu. Lange Zeit trug
ich mich mit der Idee aus den USSR zu fliehen wo ich
keine Familie, keine Verwandten und keine Aufstiegsmög-
lichkeiten hatte. Weine feindliche Einstellung zur Re-
gierung wurde stärker und stärker mit der Zeit und es
wurde für mich immer schwieriger mich zu kontrollieren
und diesen Gefühlen nicht offen Ausdruck zu verleihen,
was ich dann doch einige Male tat. Meine Erfahrung mit
der Militia und die Entwicklung meines persönlichen Le-
bens beschleunigte meine Fluchtpläne.


-17-
B.
TECHNISCHE EINZELHLITEN D2R FLUCHT:
Am 25. Juni 1962, drei Tage nach meinen Erfahrungen
mit der Miltia,verliesch meine Wohnung um 7 Uhr
frith vie jeden Tag um in die Arbeit zu gehen. Ich
verliesse die Stadt zu Puss in Richtung Samtredie.
Ich trug meine normale Kreidung hatte 80 Rubel bei
mir und eine Handsache. Ich wagte nicht den Zug zu
nehmen da ich Angst hatte von der Miltita überwacht
zu werden.Bachden ich 2-3 km auf der Landstrasse ge-
gangen war, wurde ich von einem Lastwagen eines nahe
gelegenen Kolchos mitgenommen, der in der gleichen Rich-
tung fuhr. Ich verliess den Lastwagen in der Stadtmitte
von Samtredia, zahlte dem Pührer einen Rubel und ging
zur Eisenbahnstation; hier kaufte ich eine Fahrkarte
nach Batumi und nahm den Zug um 11.50der um 14.15 in
Batumi ankam. Ich fand einen sicheren Platz und schließ
bis zur Dunkelheit. Ich verliess Batumi zu Puss entlang
des Seewfers bis ich 1 1/2 oder 2 km südlich die alte
Schiess-Stätte erreichte. Hier cing ich um ungefähr
22 Uhr ins Wasser, nachdem ich meinen Pass zerstört
hatte ( die anderen Dokumente liess ich au Hause )
und vergrub meine Kweider und Tasche. Ich wusste durch
das Studium einer Landkarte, dass ich ungefähr 18 km
zu schwiminen hatte um tinkisches Gebiet zu erreichen.
Ich schwamm die ganze Nacht und ich war nicht sicher
ob ich schon türkisches Gebiet erreicht hatte, aber
ich war erschöpft und schwamm ungefähr um 3 Uhr oder
4 Uhr früh zum Ufer. An dem Punkt wo ich ankam began
das Ufer steil anzusteigen. Ich sah die Slihuette einer
Hütte und ging hinein. Da fand ich einen élten elektri-
schen Kotor, wussisch beschriftet, woraus ich ersah, dass
ich noch in Russland war. Ich versteckte mich in der Nähe


-18-
im Gabusch und verbrrachte dort die Nacht und den fol-
genden Tag. Als es dunkel wurde, kletterte ich den Ab-
hang hinauf um das Gelände zu überblicken. Ich cing
ein Stück und hörte russische Stimmen: die vom Ufer kamen-
Ich sah einen dunklen Cegenstand auf dem Wasser, welcher
wie ein Unterseebot aussah. Ich ging weiter am Ufer
entlang und um ungefähr 22 oder 23 Uhr cing ich ins
Wasser und schwamm 3 km hinaus und dann parallel zum
Ufer. Als ich in die Reichweite eines Suchlichtes kam,
das über dem Wasser spielte, tauchte ich unter. Als
ich nach oben kam cing das Schlicht gerade über mich
hinweg, aber nichts geschah und ich wusste, dass ich
unendacht geblieben war. Ich schwamm bis zur Erschöpfung,
einige Stunden vor der Morgendämmerung schwamm ich zum
Ufer und verstockte mich in einer Höhle zwischen zwei
Felsen im Meer in Ufernähe. Da verblieb ich zum Morgen.
Am nächsten Morgen kletterte ich den Abhang hinauf, wo
ich ein steinernes Gebilde sah, das wie ein Grab aus-
sah. Ich cing hinein und schaute mir die Umgebung durch
eine kleine Öffnung an. Ich sah ein kleines Dorf, apiter
lernte ich, dass es Kemal-Pascha war. Erst dachte ich
ein Minarett wäre ein Beobachtungsturm. Ich nahm an,
es Wäre das Dorf Sarpi noch immer auf russischen Boden.
Ich war sehr durstig und kletterte den Hügel hinunter
zu einem Bach um zu trinken. Ich traf einen 11 oder
12 jährigen Buben den ich russisch ansprach, aber der
Bub lief weg. Ich war noch immer nicht sicher wo ich
war, ich ging ein Stück im Bach um meine Pussabdrücke
zu verbergen. Dann, versteckte ich mich im Gebüsch bis
zur Dunkelheit. Ich cing dann um das Dorf herum zum
anderen Ende. Ich betrat das Dorf und klopfte an die
Tür eines Hauses, das am Abhang eines Hügels lag. Ich


-19-
rief in-russischer Sprache. Ich hörte Stimien und Fuss-
tritte im Haus, aber niemand derinete. Ich kle ttert auf
das Dach eines Stalles im Hof und verbrazhete dort die
Nacht. Truth am nächsten Morgen nurde ich durch Geräusche
im Hof geweckt. Ich sah einige Frauen und zwei Männner.
Ich mährte mich ihnen und versuchte mich durch Zeichen-
sprache zu verständigen und zu erklären; dass ich aus
Rusland kam. In der Zwischenzeit waren Menschen mit
Stücken und Axten auf den Hof gekommen. Ich versuchte
wieder zu erklären, dass ich aus Russland käme und in
der Türkel verbleiben möchte. Die Kämer nahmen mich dann
zu den nulltürischen Behörden in Kemal-Pascha.
Als ich in Batuml ins Wasser ging,hatte ich Schwimnhosen
an, einen, Gürtel und ein paar Schwimnrlossen. Ich hatte
ein Klappmesser im Gürtel, einen Sack Nadeln um mich zu
stechen im Falle eines Krampfes, mein Geld war in einem
Mylonsack, 3 Tafel Schockolade, ein Konpass und zwei
Phenamin Tabletten um meine Energie zu heben, impinem
anderen Mylonsack. Mit Ausnahme des Suchlichtes auf dem
Wasser, das ich durch Tauchen zu umgehen suchte, gab es
keine anderen Hindernisse.
Ich hatte niemanden von meinen Fluchtplänen erzählt und
niemand hat mir dabei geholfen.
Von Kemal-Pascha, wo ich Kleider bekam, wurde ich mit dem
Wagen nach Erserum gebracht und von dort mit dem Zug nach
Istanbul ins Flüchtlingslager. Dort war ich eine Woche
und wurde dann mit Hilfe von US Behörden am Freitag den
6. Juli 1962 nach Deutschland gebracht.
25. DOKUMENTE:
A. PASS:
Ich erhielt meinen ersten drei Jahre gültigen Pass von der


-20-
Militia Dinststelle Nr. 17 (Pass Abteilung) des Molotowski
Rayon von Tbilisi, wo ich damals wohnte. Der Pass war ein
einzelnes Blatt Papier und meinen Photo und den wichtigsten
Daten. 1939 tauschte ich ihn gegen einen 5-Jahres Pass ein,
bei der Militia des Miche Zchakaja Rayons ausgestellt. Das
war ein Pass in der üblichen Buchform mit Photo und wich-
tigsten Daten und hatte einen propiska Stempel ( Registra-
tion mit der Militia), welcher den Tag meiner Ankunft in
dieser Stadt und meine Adresse enthielt. Als ich in die
Armee eingeszogen wurde, gab ich den Pass und das Militär-
buch bei den rayonvöjenkomat ab und belam ihn nach meiner
Entlassung wieder ausgehändigt. Darauf hin erhielt ich ei-
nen neuen 5-Jahres Pass von der gleichen Dienststelle mit
propiska, welcher meine neue Adresse anziegte. 1951 tauschte
ich diesen Pass gegen einen neuen 10-Jahres Pass ein und
1961 gegen wiederum einen neuen 10 Jahre gültigen Pass.
