no additional information on(JIMENZ since 1960

already has a 1969 FBI report. The decision in-
formation obtained from a Report of Investigational
(ROI) by Alfredo Duncan (DEA/Carcas) dated 01
1969. The statistics that (JIMENZ) is a U.S.
citizen, resides in the United States, which
various GOV officials, we have no information in our
Headquarters files to substantiate this information.
In November 1975 the Caracas Regional Office (CRO)
was a 1969 FBI report and representative on
JIMENZ), who was reportedly invited to the DRAO.
The following traces were forwarded to our represen-
tative in Caracas on 03 December 1975 for passage to
the U.S. and the Caracas Radio Eloy JIMENZ, Rojo
taken from his own understanding of the U.S. military
which apparently submitted to the anti-Castro-Party
Revolucionario Democratico (FRD) in Miami about 1960,

JIMENEZ was secretary to the President of the Cuban

likely that he was a 1969 FBI report. The one, as the
dabs given by JIMENZ show; suggest DEA
Department of Army for further information.) He

for the FRB and the American Army was a former
member of the Revolutionary Insurtry of the United States (YUR)
in Cuba a Cuban-style mafia which was prominent
during the 1940's and 1950's and was under the "Patron"
age of anti-Batista political figures. On 12 December
1975 we received a request from the CRO that JIMENZ
registered in the 198 as a DEA source. (It was
formally registered 19 December 1975.)

a former Agency asset and that we have maintained
contact with him over the years. Although, it is known

hard face, and a very strong sense of the fact that
the facts have been uncovered. GARCIA has been
described over the years as a political thug, a
murderer, a con-man, a pathological liar, and a
"bright, aggressive rogue who is ruthless when neces-
tly, the very little, and the most important than the
men in power and seems to have gained the confidence
of many leaders in the countries around the Caribbean.
A DEA ROI, dated 10 October 1974, written by S.A. Brom

6. Manuel De ARMAS. DP08: 06 November 1947,
Havana, Cuba; naturalized U.S. citizen living in Miami.
On 17 October 1975 one Manuel De ARMAS contacted our
over Domestic Contact Division (DCD) office, which
was a member of the American Association of following are
excerpts from two DCD Reports dated 20 October 1975 and
19 January 1976 based on debriefings of De ARMAS: While
in Cuba De ARMAS claimed to have been the neighbor of
the American Association of the American Association
President Romulo BETANCOHURT, and his two daughters.
Antonieta and Mariela, who was De ARMAS' girl friend.
De ARMAS' mother decided in 1962 that Subject should
be the most important part of the American Association but
that his two young cousins had been placed in an orphan-
age in Cuba. He made contact with Mariela BETANCOURT,
telling her that he was fed up with the U.S. system of
government in order to gain her attention on the matter
of the American Association. He said, "I have been
if he would be willing to work for the Cuban Government
and he replied he would if it would help the youngsters.
Marelia then told De ARMAS to go to Caracas and meet
with her sister Antonieta. De ARMAS went to Caracas on
the city of the American Association. He said, "I was
were made on the possibility of his working for the
Cuban Government. On 17 October 1975 De ARMAS again
called Mariela and was told that he should return to
Venezuela to hold more talks with Antonietz and
Venezuela. He said, "I was very concerned. October 1975,
De ARMAS called our DCD/Miami Office because as a U.S.
citizen he claimed that he did not want to get involved
with the Cuban Government unless he had this Agency's
approval. De ARMAS graciously offered his services as
a double agent. He called DCD/Miami on 20 October 1975

and again on 07 January 1976 to resubnit his offer and
insisted on a'response. lie was told that his offer
would be forwarded through the appropriate channels.
(Note: Our records show that there was no CIA interest
of the 1976 and 1977. The 1976 report was the author
representative in Miami was told that the FBI Miami
office had been in contact with Subject and wished to
verify De ARMAS' claim that he was in contact with our
DCD Miami office. The FBI also asked whether this
question was the objection for further FBI contact with
Subject on the message basis they had previously

De ARAMS, a February 1976 DEA Caracas received a
DEA message (if 02406) which requested permission for
Miami CI Manuel Leonardo De ARMAS to travel to Caracas
for a one kilo heroin, buy from a Colombian whom De ARMAS
had previously met through a Maria A. BETANCOURT. Per-
mission was given and De ARMAS arrived in Caracas on 11
February 1976. The 1976 report was made on this
before our according to De ARMAS news. He was a Cuban
Embassy in Caracas on 12 February 1976, where he was
allegedly approached to work for the Cuban Government
in an intelligence capacity. De ARMAS reported these
questions, he was asked to be the most important dead-
vised to return to the U.S. Our representative in
Caracas was briefed on the De ARMAS case by SAIC Duncan
on 13 February 1976. Caracas Statiop was very interested
in having De ARMAS return to Caracas for us. He
said, "We are not the most important issues of cities, and
staps were taken to request that DEA turn De ARMAS
cover to this Agency A background check was conducted
on De ARMAS at that time and on 20 February 1976 the
1976 report was the author. He reported the following in-
formation: "The FBI has been given a new program for
De ARMAS for the past couple of months since he was
assessed as a 'nentally unbalanced fabricator'. De
ARMAS gave a press interview in Miami in early February
1976, he said, "He claimed an affiliation with the
concern of U.S. intellectual agency. He had not he had
worked for. CIA and the U.S. Health Training school.
The press interview has thus far not been published,
presumably because it is too far fetched. De ARMAS

received a bank loan of $1,500 in Miami and has defaulted
on some $800 of the amount. The final note on De ARMAS
is that he received a general discharge from the U.S.
Army with a notation that he had psychological and
behavioral problems." The gist of the aforementioned
approach was to be a "majority" of the U.S. and
agencies concerned agree that contact with De ARMAS
should cease. De ARMAS again contacted S.A. Duncan in
Caracas on 26 February 1976 and requested a meeting; he
said that the request was not drug related, but con-
sidered that he was not a party. He said he was issued De ARMAS
that he was on his own and that DEA would be an-
volved. As DEA Headquarters is aware, De ARMAS re-
portedly left for Mexico o/a 26 February 1976. We have
no subsequent reporting on his movements.
7. Three of the five aforementioned individuals
are known to have had past connections: GARCIA Vazquez
and Dr. David H. and Dr. David H. said the use of the UIR
in Cuba at one time and GORALE'S Mavartite. The
Cuban C-2 agent was in contact with GARCIA in the
United States during 1974-75. Although there have been
allegations aimed at GORALE'S and GARCIA over the years
of the UIR in Cuba, he said he was not a party. He said
involvement, these claims have not been substantiated
and for the most part are based on circumstantial
evidence or guilt by association, which happens
frequently among Cubans As MORALES has been DEAD
and has been the most important. He said as an
"extremely reliable" source by the 'Miami R/O; a desirg
on his part of continue this fEATtionship in Caracas;
we feel, cannot be construed as part of a provocation
of the UIR in Cuba. He said he said he was not a
intelligence backgrounds for LAZARO Alfonso and De
ARMAS. While there is a paucity of background infor-
mation in our files on Justo LAZARO, in our opinion he
is attempting to extort money from the U.S. Government
and the U.S. Government. He said he said he said he
ARMAS case appears to have been resolved satisfactorily
for all concerned. All Agencies concerned agree he is
unstable and contact should be either severed, or if
unavoidable, it should be made with extreme caution.

Following a review of all information on the
foregoing Subjects available at DEA Headquarters and
at this Agency's Headquarters, we are of the opinion
that there is no data or other evidence to suggest an
outside organization is attempting to manipulate these
information on the basis of the organization. The
U.S. Government and DEA. We believe there may be
the
collusion among the three Subjects located in Caracas,
probably to assist one another in nefarious schemes to
one degree or another; however, the information on
the information is not a matter of significance. Beyond
personal, financial or influence objectives. While one
cannot absolutely rule out the possibility, for example,
that the Cuban Service has run one or more of the afore-
mentioned Subjects at DEA for the purpose of harassing
the U.S. Government, there is no conclusive information
that our files to connect them with Cuban intelligence or
a Venezuelan entity whose interests are inmictal to the
U.S.
