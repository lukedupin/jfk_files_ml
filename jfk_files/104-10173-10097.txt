The file is very difficult to follow. Items appear no further
mention. APOULE?
Salient feature of file is that LOCINOV was never the object of
X
consistent concentrated attention by anyone. There is virtually no
reporting on the LICOZY/ LOOINOV relationship. What there is implies
that L/S is unco-operative and nearly refuses to work with L.
SUMMARY
SUSCEPTIBILITY Nothing in the conventional sense. If he is trying to
tell us anything he is obviously trying to get our attention via a CI
ploy with the intention of bringing us to him. We moves with confidence
and near-impunity--certainly not like one who might be in trouble.
PROFESSIONALISM: Not smooth and subtle nor particularly secure. But
cratty, fast on his feet, makes fast decisions and then acts on them.
Aggressive and ubiquitous. Socially active. Noman-chaser.
PERSONALITY: See above.
Sho:ld be leaving before another year and one-half. Has been there for
three and one-half years.
See other similar cases.
