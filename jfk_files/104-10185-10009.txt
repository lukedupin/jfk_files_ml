2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
3 July 1962
TO: NKH
FM: AMS
RE: ZRRIFLE
1. Per our discussion of 2 July 1962, I expect that we
shall proceed to transfer QJWIN to Baden-Baden per the proposal
in QLLA-1163 dated 2 February 1962. LUXE/0489 dated 19 June
1962 stated that COS would have the full details of the
capital outlay required by 23 June; however, the information
has not been received as of 3 July. The last cable to the
Station, D1613321. told COS to contact you directly on his
writing.
2. With regard to candidates spotted by QJWIN, the
two whom he spotted in Italy a year and a quarter ago can
probably be used if needed, if we can accept the assessments
of them by the Trieste Base contract agent, Magonetti.
Magonetti's assessment is contained in OIRA,27542 dated
1962. The "COST" is a "COST" two French candidates are con-
tained in QLLA 116246 dated 15 December 1962. No action has
been taken on these names regarding tracing or anything else.
My handwritten notes attached to that dispatch contain
further descriptions of the two people than appear in the
dispatch.
3. The "Bitter"spotting effort that can be made is
throun. The Manfredi (M) in Borne, thank was well briefed
on the qualifications/desired and the act of precautions
to be observed in the spotting activity. COS may be
copy of the qualifications and restrictions in his safe
however, if Manfredi is told to proceed with his contact in
Florence, I Suggest that he be re-briefed in detail.
4. Frankly, all the rest of the paper in the file is
crud except for the pay receipt which are assembled in one
envelope. I have already given/ the ZRRIFLE authorization
paper signed by Helms and Skip has been given the QJWIN con-
tract including the ertension to 1 March 1963.
5. The details which have yet to be worked out are
a. The precise method of contact with QJWIN
b. The system of drawing funds for payments to him
c. An emergency contact for him (this should
probably be COS LUXE).

6. Despite COS LUXE's viewpoint, I happen to know that
QJMIN can do more spotting in Corsican circles whenever we
want him to.
