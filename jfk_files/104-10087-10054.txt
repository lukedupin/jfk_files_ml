CHAPTER III, ANNEX B
15 November 1974
e. OI Code: a two letter symbol used in
with the 201
personality records in the 201 system to record the
of an individual
with organizations or activities of operational
interest. OI codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation whether staff or agent, or known or
suspect, as well as activities of OI
codes for use by components.
(1) General OI
(2) OI codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
or their specific organization.
A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-
orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
Officer.
A 201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned
when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see
paragraph 6b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added
at a later date by a Form 831 amendment.
The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201
personality by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service.
f. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on
names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dosiers
exist.

a. Purging
Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires
discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the
simple distinction between official and material papers; it will therefore take
place under the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be done
periodically. A 201 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should
be pugged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following:
(1) Duplication material (s) of a document.
(2) Name from 362) unless it has been the basis for
the opening.
(3) All abstract slips.
(4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884).
(5) The disseminated version of positive intelligence information if
a copy of the raw report is contained in the 201 file; the dissemination number
then must be transferred to the first page of the raw report.
(6) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch
cover sheets unless there are remarks such as coordinations or comments.
(7) Record copy documents which only repeat substantive information
contained in other documents in the file; authorization for destruction is
by the Records Officer.
(8) The documents are not to be reviewed in a 201 dossier
forwarded to Central Files; the standard must be downgraded for retention

name 201 if one exists or converted to the true name.
(6) Field and duplicate (shadow) 201 files no longer of active interest
should be incorporated into the official 201 after the duplicate material
has been purged by the desk officer and the remaining information classified
to that 201 by the Analysis Section (IF).
(7) Any document with a predessor organization cover sheet or an
OPC (Office of Policy Coordination) cover sheet from the Archives and

All standard listings are cumulative; previous editions must be destroyed
upon receipt of current editions. These listings are by their very nature extremely
sensitive compilations of information and must be given mery possible safeguard.
b. Non-Standard Listings
Based on one or more of the following selection criteria:
(1) Country
(2) OI codes
(3) Citizenship
(4) Year of birth (plulor minus a given number of years)
(5) Occupation.
These selection criteria may be used singly or in combinations. For example,
a user could obtain a list of all 201 personalities who have been assigned the
OI code of XX or codes of XX, XY, or XX. A 201 personality list could also be
produced of all persons who were born in Germany between the years 1915
and 1920, with the occupation computer specialist, who are now citizens of the
United States. The organization's degree of employment assigned the OI code AA.
Note however that the listing would contain only one of the following:
OI code AA. Those personalities with an OI code other than AA and those
with no OI code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that
persons who have not been assigned an OI code also be included. Note also
that the organization's degree of employment is listing will be only as specific
as the occupation code (Attachment 1). The organization's degree of employment
covers only a documented courier. Some occupation codes cover more than one
occupation. For example, the occupation code CRAF covers those who practice
some trade or manual occupation, i.e., carpenters, bricklayers for painters, mechanics
and electricians. If a list is requested for electricians or others in this category
will be included in the printout. These registered authors may be sorted
(arranged) according to any, parabondary (1) of the following keywords:
(1) Name
REI
(b) Given name
(c) Date of birth
(d) Country of birth
(e) Citizenship
(f) OI code
(g) Location

CHAPTER III, ANNEX B
CLANDESTINE SERVICES
HANDBOOK NO. 43-1-1
15 February 1960
of the Cuban desk on the dramatis personae. In addition to 201 per-
sonalities, such lists should contain the names and identifying data
of persons who should be kept track of though they may only be of
tangential interest or on wham there were be little or no data other
than that given in the
4. To accommodate this form of the 201 system,
edentifiable personality
when enough information is not
yet available to require the opening of a file may be assigned numbers
of the following type but in the same series:
IDN-123457
7
These are relabeled "201" if a file is opened. IDN numbers are car-
ried with 201 numbers in appropriate general or special listings,
where they are identified by the letter "I" in the "Type of Name" col-
umn. IDN numbers are not as file numbers.
5. All 201 code numbers are assigned by RID at headquarters,
either upon receipt of form 831, or of a field dispatch. If a dispatch
is written about a personality not yet in the system, a 201 number for
it may be requested simply by writing under headquarters file number
in the dispatch form as follows:
Dispatch Symbol and No.
201-123457
6. IDN numbers are provided by RID at headquarters upon the
request of stations or packs which are developing special identification
programs within the 201 system. The field receives current notifica-
tion of new 201 openings and IDN numbers through the Field Index Card
Service.
