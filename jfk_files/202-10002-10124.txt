Subject: Psychological Programs Subcommittee - Cuba
1. An informal meeting of the Interdepartmental Subcommittee
(Psychological Programs) on Cuban Affairs was convened in
Room 7519, New State at 1430 hours, 30 December 1963. The
agenda for the meeting was not pre-announced. Present from
State were Chairman Bowdler, Sylvester, and Montenegro;
GCOA
from CIA, Tilton and Holloway! from USIA, Murphy; and the
undersigned.
GCOE
2. The following topics were discussed:
a. CUTAL (Unified Labor Federation for Latin America)
meeting scheduled for Rio de Janeiro, 24 - 28 January 1964.
Mr. Montenegro, State labor advisor for Latin America,
described the anticipated meeting as a "founding" assemblage
of left-wing labor leaders, socialists, and communists who
will attempt to resolve their differences. State believes
that there will be a concerted effort by the communists
to wrest the leadership of the fledgling federation from
Mexican socialist elements. Following actions were
discussed:
(1) State to cable US Ambassador to Brazil to
ascertain the degree to which local (not national)
governmental elements will support disruptive and
harassing actions before and during the meeting.
(2) State to circularize Latin American posts
with the suggestion that local influences be brought
to bear in order to discourage country delegates
from attending the meeting.
(3) USIA to consider VOA broadcasts to Latin
America in order to exploit exposes of Cuban,
East German, and Chinese Communist labor conditions.
(4) CIA to continue black propaganda operations
2016
in Brazil which suggest postponement of the meeting.

SUBJECT:
Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee of Cuban
Affairs: Possible Retaliatory Actions by the Castro
Government (U)
Reference:
Memorandum from the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs
Dept of State, subject as above, 13 Sep 63
In response to reference memorandum, outlined below is the
status of existing contingency plans for those priority situations agreed
upon at our meeting of September 12, 1963. The numbering of the para-
graphs below corresponds to the format utilized in the attachment to
reference memorandum and includes those actions for which Department
of Defense specific or related military contingency plans exist.
"A. Actions Against U. S. Targets in Cuba
"4. Harassment of Guantanamo
"(a) Cutting off of the water supply"
2016
COMMENT:
A minimum of approximately 20 days supply of water is
MAR
maintained in reserve storage at the naval base. Provision is made
for the emergency resupply of water by tanker, which would require
a maximum of eighteen days and which would be implemented on order
of CINCERNITFLT. In addition, evacuation of non-essential personnel
in 24 hours or less can be accomplished if directed.
"(b) Closing access to the base by Cuban workers
who commute"

purpose of substantially reducing the time required for the U. S.
fighter aircraft to reach the scene. Such overflights may be author-
ized only by specifically designated commanders.
"5. Attack on staging areas employed by exiles in the
Caribbean"
COMMENT:
With regard to Castro attacks on areas in Latin America,
plans exist for the U. S. military to respond to requests for assistance
by Latin American governments subject to U. S. Governmental approval
GUCO
There is also an arrangement for the interchange of information between
the U. S. Coast Guard and British naval forces with regard to possible
staging areas which may be used by exiles in the Bahamas.
"E. Actions Against Targets in the US
"i. Sabotage or terroristic bombings"
COMMENT: The level of intensity of such actions contemplated within
the context of the paper is not considered to exceed the capabilities of
law enforcement agencies to control. There are military contingency
plans to protect against this type of activity at a much higher level of
intensity.
"
"2. Jamming of US radio stations"
COMMENT: There are standing operating procedures to overcome
interference and jamming methods employed against military communi-
cations.
The summaries of actions set forth above are essentially defensive
reactions to Cuban initiatives. There are, of course, existing and related
military plans, retaliatory in nature, which range up to and include a full
scale military invasion of Cuba.
It was generally agreed at the September 13, 1963 meeting of
the Committee that the most likely actions of the Cuban government are
those which would not provoke United States retaliation seriously and
immediately endangering the Castro regime. It appears more likely
that Castro might intensify his support of subversive forces in Latin

"3. Hot pursuit of or attack on raiding boats on the
high seas or another country's territorial waters
"4. Attack on mother ship or exile raiders on the
high seas or in another country's territorial waters
COMMENT It is noted that it is contrary to the land
policy to permit raids on Cuba originating from
U.S. territory, however, at the time a ship or
aircraft is discovered to be under Cuban attack
it may be difficult to identify it as a "pirate"
"raider", "mother ship" or "exile raider", even
though this, in fact, may be the case. All the
proposed property of the United States, which
least in part, by the rules of engagement with
have been approved by the highest national
authority. However, the action summarized below
is not only in the case of U.S. ships and
aircraft and the United States, which is not
being of foreign registry. Commanders are not
authorized to organize deliberately a pursuing
force, however ships or aircraft ordered to the
villages, and the ship is not a subject to protective
measures including pursuit to, but not in the
Cuban air space or territorial waters. U.S.
pilots are not authorized to attack unless either
the ship or aircraft they are defending
is endangered by or in the event Cuban
aircraft limit their action to harm. The assessment, U.S.
pilots are limited to making their
presence known by flying close aboard the Cuban

Subject: Psychological Programs Subcommittee - Cuba
1. An informal meeting of the Interdepartmental Subcommittee
(Psychological Programs) on Cuban Affairs was convened in
Room 7519, New State at 1430 hours, 30 December 1963. The
agenda for the meeting was not pre-announced. Present from

2. The following topics were discussed:
a. CUTAL (Unified Labor Federation for Latin America)
meeting scheduled for Rio de Janeiro. 24 - 28 January 1964.
Mr. Montenegro, State labor advisor for Latin America,
described the anticipated meeting as a "founding" assemblage
of left-wing labor leaders, socialists, and communists who
will attempt to resolve their differences. State believes
that there will be a concerted effort by the communists
to wrest the leadership of the fledgling federation from
Mexican socialist elements. Following actions were
discussed:
(1) State to cable US Ambassador to Brazil to
ascertain the degree to which local (not national)
governmental elements will support disruptive and
harassing actions before and during the meeting.
(2) State to circularize Latin American posts
with the suggestion that local influences be brought
to bear in order to discourage country delegates
from attending the meeting.
(3) USIA to consider VOA broadcasts to Latin
America in order to exploit exposes of Cuban,
East German, and Chinese Communist labor conditions.
(4) CIA to continue black propaganda operations
in
which suggest postponement of the meeting.
