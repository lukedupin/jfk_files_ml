SECHET
8 2 MAY 1973
MEMORANDUM FOR: Associate Deputy Director for Operations
THROUGH:
MPS/BG
SUBJECT:
Amendment and Termination of Project
KDFACTOR
1. Project KDFACTOR supported a visual and photo-
graphic surveillance operation in Mexico City targetted
against the Soviet Embassy. Assets included five agents
and two bashcourse surveillance sites. Termination of
this project, effective 30 June 1972, was the result of
the priority review which revealed that the VEMANKEF
principal linev the basic details of the DRAFTOR opera-
tions.
2. Agent termination was accomplished without any
immediate difficulties; however, continued security will
depend on the terminated agents' silence. In the event
there is a compromise, the risk of damage to the Sta-
national relations with the Mexican Government should be
inconsistent because of the compatibio nature of KDFACTOR's
operations.
3. The ADDO approved Amendment No. 1 to the proj-
ect in the amount of $9,844 for FY 1972 to provide for
the agent terminations, but an overrun of $7,246 oc-
curred as the result of miscalculation of termination
costs. This project action requests this additional
sum of $7,246 to cover these expenses.
4. The FI Staff recommends approval of this amend-
ment/termination request.

SECRET
MEMORANDUN FOR: Associate Deputy Director
For Operations
SUBJECT
:
Project KDFACTOR - Amendment
and Termination Request.
1. The KDFACTOR Project (until 1970 encrypted
as the LIENITY Project) was initially approved in
1958 to provide financial and material support for
visual and photographic surveillance operations
targetted against the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City. In June 1972 the project supported five
agents and two basehouse surveillance sites.
2. The KDFACTOR Project was approved by the
ADDC in the amount of $19,000 for FY - 72 and
$20,000 for FY - 73. Per DIRECTOR 285355, dated
30 June 1972, the ADDO approved Amendment No. 1
for FY - 72. FACTOR Project in the amount of $9,844
terminations to provide for costs of agent
3. The decision to terminate all agents and
facilities under the KDFACTOR Project was based
on a security review of the project activities
and the project's activities. The KDFACTOR
plan
have
the basic details of the KDFACTOR operations,
including the target, the location of the surveillance
sites, and probably the true names and former
cryptonyms of the agents covered by the project.
4. The cost of terminating the agents under the
KDFACTOR Project amounted to $15,573; the cost of
closing down the two basehouses under the project
to the cost of terminating the agents under the
Project in FY 72 was $36,090 which is $7,246 over
the approved authorization of $28,844. The overage
was incurred in terminating the agents and
facilities associated with the KDFACTOR Project.
Although Amendment No. 1 to the project was
approved in the amount of $9,841 to cover the
cost of terminating the agents in the

project, the actual payments made by Mexico City
Station per the terms of each Memorandum of Oral
Cermitment (MOC) and in accordance with Mexican
law and custom exceeded the estimate for termination
costs made by Headquarters at the time the Amendment
was requested. Termination payments made to each
agent are as follows:
(Recruited 1956)
$8,160
(Recruited 1956)
2,366
(Recruited 1956)
2,830
(Recruited 1956)
649
(Recruited 1966)
1,568
The long tenure of three of the terminated
agents, the relatively high monthly salary of
RDFACTOR-2 ($440) plus the computation of the
termination payments in accordance with the
law and cost of the agreement, as shown on the
final statement termination costs amounted to $15,573.
S. All agent terminations were accomplished
in an amicable manner. No visible security risks
were apparent at the time of the terminations
although any one, or all, of the terminated agents
were not in the case of the termination payments
interested party the details of the KDFACTOR Project
operations. KDFACTOR-2, KDFACTOR-5, and KDFACTOR-6
have worked in photo surveillance operations for
the United States. The KDFACTOR Project was
have considerable knowledge of targets, former
safesites, personnel, and modus operandi of the
Station. However, since the KDFACTOR Project was
awarded to the Board of Directors, the KDFACTOR
targets, we believe the risks of damage to Station
relations with the Mexican Government in the event
of exposure of the KDFACTOR Project operations by a
terminated agent are within acceptable limits.
6. It is requested that the KDFACTOR Project
be amended to provide the sum of 57,246 for FY -
72 to cover the costs of terminating five agents
and two basehouse surveillance sites under this
project.

3. The decision to terminate all agents and facilities
under the KDFACTOR Project was based on a security review
of the project activities which indicated that the WBLANKET
principal knew the basic details of the KDFACTOR operations,
including the target, the location of the surveillance sites,
and probably the true names and former cryptenyms of the
agents covered by the project.
4. The project is operating all the agents in the KDFACTOR
Project. The mounted to $15,573.00 which was considerably more
than had been initially estimated when Amendment No. 1 for
FY-72 was requested and approved. The total amount charged
to the KDFACTOR Project in FY-72 was $36,080 which is $7,246
over the project's authorization of $28,844. The overage
was incurred in terminating agents and facilities associated
with the KDFACTOR Project; the effective date of all termi-
nations was 30 June 1972.

amicable manner. No visible security risks were apparent
at the time of the examinations. although any one, or all

dilvulge to an interested party the details of the
KDFACTOR Project operations. KDFACTOR-2 and KDFACTOR-5
have worked in photo surveillance operations for the
Station since 1957 and, therefore, obviously have consider-
ing the data and the data, and the data are not available
and
modus operandi of the Station. However, since the KDFACTOR
Project was not concerned with incompatible operations or
targets, we believe the risks of damage to Station relations
with the Mexican Government in the event of exposure of the
KDFACTOR Project operations by a terminated agent are within
acceptable limits.
6, It is requested that the KDFACTOR Project be amended
to provide the sum of $7,246 for FY-72 to cover the costs of
terminating five agents and two basehouse surveillance
sites covered by this project.
7. It is also requested that the termination of the
KDFACTOR Project be approved effective 30 June 1972.

Changes:
1. The processing of photographs obtained through this
project now is performed inside the Station. KDFACTOR-1, who
formerly processed the take in an outside safehouse, was
terminated amicably in early March 1971. Security and effi-
ciency have been increased by this change. KDFACTOR-1 was
terminated in 1970, but the termination payments were made
during FY 1971 causing an increase in that years obligations.
2. Howard T. BAGAUS handled the administration of this
project to early April 1971 when project responsibility
reverted from the Operations Support Section to the REDTOP
Section. At that time Timothy H. ARCHBOLD assumed the isside
administrative supervision, and agent meetings were turned
over to the outside case officer Bruce H. FERNALD. When
ARCHBOLD departed PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J. MANKUNAS
assumed responsibility for this project, including agent
meetings.
Accomplishments:
1. This project has provided continuous daily photo-
graphic and visual coverage of personnel and vehicles entering
or leaving the Soviet Embassy. A total of 530 rolls of film
were produced during the reporting period. U.S. citizens,
visitors, and DY personnel are given special attention. Iden-
tifications of license plates and automobile descriptions as
well as drivers and their companions are identified under this
project. Additionally, attendance sheets are maintained to
establish who is at the Embassy on any given day and hour.


These photographs and reports have contributed operational
support to the Station's Soviet operations which is not
attainable elsewhere. For example, whenever the Soviets
change all their license numbers the Station is able to
compile a new, complete roster within a matter of weeks.
1. General: $19,000 is requested for FY 1972 and

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans
THROUGH:
MPS/BG
SUBJECT:
Reneval of Project KDFACTOR
in 1972 for $19,000
in 1973 for $20,000
1. This project covers photo and visual surveillance
of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. One observation
post covers the front gate of the building, and another
covers the rear gate and walled compound. Five salaried
agents man the sites. four in front and one in back. An
official cover case officer collects the take (rolls of
film and logs of visitors) once a week by car meetings
with the OP keepers. The films are developed and printed
inside the website.
The production from this operation has consis-
tently been rated high by the Bureau (which is the prin-
cipal customer in the field), by other Government agencies
and by SB Division. Photosurveillance of a Soviet Embassy
might not be a high priority target in some countries.
The following: the U.S. Government, the U.S. Army, large
and active one and the fact that its primary target is
operations against the United States make our effort
important and valuable. This is the operation that pro-
duct the photographs of Lee Harvey Oswald visiting the
Soviet Embassy in 1962.
3. This seemingly straightforward operation has not
allowed an ongred collected. Both sites have been in
operation to be served by the same OP keepers for more than
a dozen years. At one of the sites the OP keeper's wife
and children take turns manning the equipment. A now-
terminated principal agent was divorced several years
age, for a wife who knew a lot about the U.S. some
year of the U.S. military, and the other doctor who for
years was supposed to be developing the films was simply
too busy to do so and that the work was probably done by
his uncleared secretary. Family relationships keep
cropping up among supposedly compartmented agents. All
of this is in the files but not in any one place. We


believe it is time for the Station to make an updated
security review of the operation with particular attention
to the knowledgeableity of terminated agents and their
families. We also believe that the Station should now
address itself to the contingency that the present sites
or personnel will be blown and to investigate alternative
means of continuing their valuable coverage.
4. The ADDP last approved this project in May 1970
with the condition that termination payments to the
principal agent and his divorced wife be made on a
monthly basis. This condition has been met.
5. The budgets requested for the next two years are
simple and straightforward. Salaries and the traditional
bonuses are not available for the about $13,000.
Rent and utilities on the two observation posts come to
$5,600. The small balance is for operational expenses.
This project action also requests amendment of the FY
1971 budget by $4,260 to cover that part of the cost of
termination bonuses to the principal agent and his di-
vorced wife which could not be absorbed by the project.
The total of the termination bonuses was $12,500.
6. This is a valuable and productive project which
helps fulfill a Priority A-1 Station requirement. The
F1 Staff recommends approval.

Changes:
1. The processing of photographs obtained through this
project now is performed inside the Station. KDFACTOR-1, who
formerly processed the take in an outside safehouse, was
terminated amicably in early March 1971. Security and effi-
ciency have been increased by this change. KDFACTOR-7 was
terminated in 1970, but the termination payments were made
during FY 1971 causing an increase in that years obligations.
2. Howard T. BAGAUS handled the administration of this
project to early April 1971 when project responsibility
reverted from the Operations Support Section to the REDIOP
Section. At that time Timothy H. ARCHBOLD assumed the inside
administrative supervision, and agent meetings were turned
over to the outside case officer Bruce H. FERNALD. When
ARCHBOLD departed PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J. MANKUNAS
assumed responsibility for this project, including agent
meetings.
Accomplishments:
1. This project has provided continuous daily photo-
graphic and visual coverage of personnel and vehicles entering
or leaving the Soviet Embassy. A total of 530 rolls of film
were produced during the reporting period. U.S. citizens,
visitors, and TDY personnel are given special attention. Iden-
tifications of license plates and automobile descriptions as
well as drivers and their companions are identified under this
project. Additionally, attendance sheets are maintained to
establish who is at the Embassy on any given day and hour.

Purpose:
Project LIMPTV supports a visual and photographic
surveillance of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. The
aim is to identify and cover the movements of persons
entering and leaving the Embassy, including Soviets and
visitors. The intelligence collected through such activity
contributes to the Station's overall Soviet operations
program, mainly in support of Priority A-1, but to some
extent, priority A-4, of the Operating Directive for Mexico.
Description:
1. The Project operates through two fixed basohouse
surveillance posts, a small photographic laboratory, a sub-
principal agent, and six sub-agents. A team of four sub-
algorithms, the Department of the Department of
photographic surveillance of the Soviet Embassy front
eustrance. One sub-agent, operating from a second base-
house, covers an area in back of the Embassy, where Soviet
analyses are made available. The department of the
persons moving in or out of the specific target areas. They
also maintain logs and provide written reports on observed
activity. All of this material is passed to the principal
agent, who passes the film to another sub-agent for process-
ing the laboratory equipment, and the other two of the
film is placed, and pointed, the principal agent passes
the finished product, plus written reports and logs, to the
Station case officer. A brief description of each unit,
each agent and his role in the operation follows.

2. LILYRIC (MEXI-112)) is a basonious located near
the front of the Soviet Embassy. This house has been in
operation since October 1966. It is rented through
LIMOUSINE (201-5762), a cleared American businessman. He
is the ostensible owner of record and, as the landlord,
collects rent from the tenants and then passes it to the
Station case officer. LIEMPTY-13 and his family (see
the 1966) below) live in the LILYRIC house and conduct
their survival balance operation from it during daylight hours
(0800-1800).
3. LIEMPTY-13 (201-119961) is the key member of the
LILYRIC baschouse team. He maintains contact with the
principal agent and has been in the House work. However,
he is not a local is employed outside the House. He
engineer, he is unable to spend much time operating the
LILYRIC photographic equipment, and most of this work is
done by his wife, LIEMPTY-14, and their sons, LIEMPTY-26
and LIEMPTY-27 (sco paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 below).
4. LIEMPTY-14 (201-167567) is the main photograph
and observer at the LILYRIC baschouse. She works closely
with her husband, LIEMPTY-13, in running the operation,
including the preparation of observation reports and logs.
5. LIEMPTY-14 (201-167567) does the LILYRIC housekeeping, as any housewife
would be.
5. LIEMPTY-26 (201-762111), the son of LIEMPTY-13 and
LIEMPTY-14, has been a student at the Mexican Technological
Institute. In his spare time he operates the LILYRIC photo-
graphic equipment, and helps LIEMPTY-14 in maintaining the
arrived by the LILYRIC House.
6. LIEMPTY-27 (201-762112), another son of LIEMPTY-13
and LIEMPTY-14, has been a prep school student. He assists
in operating the LILYRIC photographic equipment and tran-
scribes notes into a finished typewritten log of events.
7. LICALLA (MEXI-03) is a baschouse located behind
the Soviet Embassy. It has been in operation since 1957.
The building, a four-unit affair, collectively known as
LIMUST, is Agency owned. It was purchased through
LIMOUSINE in September 1957, and the property is in his
name. The LICALLA site is occupied by LIEMPTY-9 (See
paragraph 8 below) and he runs the surveillance operation
from it.

8. LIENPTY-9 (201-136454) is the only agent operating
from the LICALLA site. He does all the photography, main-
tains logs and prepares observation reports. He also main-
tains contact with the principal agent. LIENPTY-9 is a
part-time insurance salesman and is self-employed in the
accounting business, which he conducts at the LICALLA site.
9. Raymond H. GERENDE (201-119523) has been the
principal agent for this project. He is a Mexican national
executive president of the LIEMPTY and a senior president
and also works as a salesman for a light bulb manufacturer.
GERENDE has been mainly responsible for maintaining contact
with the LIENPTY agents, passing instructions to them, and
collecting the product for passing to the Station case
and the Station case. He is a member of the
administrative matters. He is being terminated by the end
of FY 1970 for security reasons (see Problems, paragraph 1),
10. Bruce H. FERNALD (P) (201-008189) replaced
GERENDE (see paragraph 9 above) as the project's principal
agent in early December 1969. FERNALD, a U.S. citizen born
in June 1915, operates under non-official cover as a retired
company. He is a member of the American Association for
the LIENPTY agents and collecting the product for passing
to the Station case officer. He also handles administrative
matters, including agent salary payments. FERNALD is
financially covered under Project AEMAGNIFY.
11. The LIENPTY photographic laboratory (VEXi-137) is
located in a room at GERENDE's respectively. It is equipped
with a 100-m³ of the 100-m³ of the LIENPTY surveillance
units. The work is done by LIENPTY-4. (See paragraph 12
below). Since GERENDE will be terminated by the end of
FY 1970, the Station is taking steps to establish a new
LIENPTY photographic laboratory at a new safesite.
12. LIENPTY-4 (201-117967) processes all the photo-
graphic film taken by the LIENPTY photographers and makes
the number of prints required. He does this work at night
in the LIENPTY photographic laboratory. He is self-employed
as a medical doctor, and he is a brother-in-law of GERENDE,
in whose home the laboratory is located.

Changes:
1. The LIENTRAP mobile unit, consisting of LIEMPTY-10
and LIEMPTY-11, is being removed from Project LIEMPTY and
placed under Project LIEMBRACE, which supports a unilateral
physical surveillance team. The purpose of this change is
to increase the size of the LIEMBRACE team in order to meet
the requirements of the surveillance support from
the various Station operating services. The transfer will
become effective at the beginning of FY 1971 and
FY 1971 project budgets have been adjusted to do the financial
aspects of the change.
1. Raymond II. ENDE was removed as the LIEMPTY
principle agreement carefully December 1969 owing to a security
problem (agencies, paragraph 1) He was replaced on
9 December 1969 by Bruce H. FERNALD, a career agent oper-
ating under cover as a retired immigrant. The chang? has
caused some delay in the receipt of photographs because
the non-unionist, but LIEMPTY agents as frequently
GERENDE had met them, but it was not a significant risk not
significantly reduced by this delay. The key issue is that
security and reliability of the principal agent have improved
considerably.
Accomplishments:
1. Project LIEMPTY has provided continuous daily
photographic-and visual coverage (Monday through Saturday)
of the front entrance and rear areas of the Soviet Embassy
and the Soviet Union, which is a major part of the
entering or leaving the Embassy have been photographed. In
addition, visual surveillance reports were prepared when
appropriate. These photographs and reports have contributed
essential operational support- to the Station's Soviet oper-
ations program.
2. Recently, LIEMPTY photographs were exclusively used
to provide updated mugbook on Soviet officials in Mexico.
The book has been loaned to the FBI, AF/OSI and the 902nd
Military Intelligence Group for operational use in debriefing
their agents engaged in dangle operations and double agent
operations against the Soviet services in Mexico City. One
902nd controlled agent was identified from an LIEMPTY photo-
graph taken when the agent tried to contact the Soviets at


SECRET
-5-
the Soviet Embassy in Novico City. Similarly, an AP/OSI
controlled agent scheduled to meet a Soviet contact was
unable to do so owing to illness, but LIEMPTY photographed
another person who appeared at the meeting site and this
person is believed to be the agent's Soviet case officer.
Such coverago has been helpful to the 902nd, AF/OSI and
the FBI in running their controlled double agent operations
against the U.S..
3. Within one week after a biannual change of license
plates on Soviet Embassy vehicles, LIEMPTY had provided a
complete list of the new tag numbers, along with a complete
identification of the vehicles. Among other things, this
enabled the Station to identify the companions of Aleksandr
Aleksandrovich NIKITIN, a known KGB officer, during his
last few days.
3. LIEMPTY has also determined that newcomers to the
Soviet Embassy frequently gravitate to groupings with their
RIS colleagues in the "safety" of the Embassy backyard.
This fact enabled the Station to make certain tentative
KGB and GRU identification. In addition, certain TYors
have been linked up with that sector officers and clues
to people who have been involved in the U.S. and the
502nd.
In the fold of Soviet patterns of activity and
associations, LIEMPTY has been able to report accurate
changes in certain specific cases. LIEMPTY coverage showed
that NIKITIN, montioned in paragraph 3 above, changed his
society. In the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S.
Yerofeyevna KISENIKOVA, former secretary in the Commercial
Mission in Mexico. The same applies to Oleg NECHIPORENKO,
a
Second Secretary at the Embassy and a known KGB officer.
In the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S.
associations of Yuriy Viktorovich KUPLYAKOV, a known KGB
officer and on Valerly Vladimirovich SOKOLIN, a known GRU
officer. Coverage of Vladimir Viktorovich GORDEYEV, a
suspect KOB officer, showed that he did, in fact, work in a
U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S.
who some of his associates were. In the case of Oleg
Konstantinovich IGNATYEV, who had arrived in Mexico City
from Caracas, Vezouzela, LIEMPTY was able to observe
IGNATYEV entering and leaving in the company of Svyastoslav
Pedorovich KUNENBOV, Press Attache and First Secretary of
the Soviet Embassy. IGNATYEV also visited the Soviet Embassy
SECRET


-6-
several other times during his stay in Mexico City and
had contact with other known. Soviet intelligence officers
while visiting. This kind of information is a basic
contribution to the Station's continuing efforts to
identify and assess certain Soviets for possible
recruedness.
6.2. At Headquarters, the Soviet Bloc Division uses
LIEMPTY photographs, particularly photographs of Soviet
Embassy officials, for identification purposes in con-
nection with defector cases. The LIEMPTY material also
keeps the Station's Soviet section up-to-date on which
Soviet officers have been in the Embassy, which ones have
been away: who has used which car: who has been in contact
with whom; and other similar information useful in the
protection of Soviet operations.
Problems:
1. A security problem has developed involving
Raymond H. GERENDE. According to GERENDE, his wife wants
a divorce, apparently based mainly on incompatability of
personalities. The problem basically is that both want
custody of the children and this has sparked a dispute
of the problem. He has been a very good candidate for
the monetary settlement is in dispute. The problem is
compounded by the fact that GERENDE's wife knows in some
considerable detail of GERENDE's activities on behalf of
the Agency. Thus, if the case does go to court, it could
be a very good deal of the security of the President and
possible compromise of LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP.
Even if the case does not go to court, GERENDE's wife could
expose him as an Agency employee. Since late 1969, Mexico
had been a very good candidate for the other. He was
wife on this problem, and every effort is being made by
the Station to have both parties settle the divorce out of
court, and to protect GERENDE's cover and that of the
project. After weighing all factors that were decided
to be made, he was able to keep GERENDE, is not an acceptable
risk, and the decision has been reached to terminate him
by the end of FY 1970. GERENDE will be paid a termination
bonus of $10,000 for 15 years service, about $1,250 more
than the $8,750 his contract calls for, in order to ensure
that the termination is amicable and thereby preserve


-7-
project security. In addition, his wife, LIEMPTY-19 will
be given $2,500 as a security measure designed to keep her
from revealing what she knows about project operations.
The FY 1970 budget is being amended to cover this amount.
2. Other aspects of security continue relatively
unchanged. All the agents still have jobs to backstop
their Agency wages. The Station is compartmented from
the
work of the U.S. and the U.S. government. The U.S. the
sub-agents is reasonably well covered by his status as a
retired immigrant. FERNALD has been meeting LIEMPTY-9 and
LITEMPY-13 since 9 December 1969. Brief meetings are held
once each week at pre-arranged times and places, well away
from the U.S. and the U.S. government. The U.S. government
called, by phone, if special coverage is desired. FERNALD
also meets LIEMPTY-1 to exchange films and prints. These
meetings are held weekly at pre-arranged times and places.
FERNALD can change meeting plans by calling LIEMPTY-4
and U.S. government. The U.S. government has been given
given a special extension in the Station through which he
may call as "Dr. Carios" to leave a message for "Victor"
(FERNALD). The Station case officer maintains weekly clan-
destine contact with FERNALD in order to manage the oper-
ation and collect the product.
Coordination:
Ambassador McBride has not been briefed on Project
LIEMPTY.
Future Plans:
1. The surveillance units are expected to continue to
produce valuable information in the form of photographic
coverage and visual surveillance reports on the daily
work of the U.S. government. The U.S. government of
persons frequenting the Soviet Embassy, including Soviet
officials. Operational procedures and the project mecha-
nism will continue as it has in the past, except that Bruce

4. Foreign Currency: There is no special need for
foreign currency. No non-CIA funds are used.
5. Commitments: Christmas bonuses to all agents
totaling $2,354 for FY 1971, and termination pay in an
amount to be determined by the agents record and length
of service.
6. Funding: Funds are hand-carried from the Station
case officer to FERNALD, and from FERNALD to the sub-agents.
The transfer of funds takes place under clandestine meeting
conditions, and appropriate security measures are always
taken.
7. Accountability: FERNALD accounts in detail to his
case officer, who in turn submits receipts to the Station
and certifies that funds were spent to cover expenses for
which it was intended.
8. Annexes: None

8. LIEIMPTY-9 (201-136454) is the only agent operating
from the LICALLA site. He does all the photography, main-
tains logs and prepares observation reports. He also misa-
tains contact with the principal agent. LIEIMPTY-9 is a
part-time insurance salesman and is self-employed in the
accounting business, which he conducts at the LICALLA site.
9. Raymond H. GERNDE (201-119523) has been the
principal agent for this project. He is a Mexican national
contract agent who is self-employed as an English teacher
and has been a member of the American College of
GERENDE has been mainly responsible for maintaining contact
with the LEMPTY agents, passing instructions to them, and
collecting the product for passing to the Station case
officer. He has also paid them and handled all other
administrative matters, including a number of years, and
of progress, and the reasons (see Problems, page 1),
10. Bruce H. FERNALD (P) (201-008180) replaced
GERENDE (see paragraph 9 above) as the project's principal
agent in early December 1969. FERNALD, a U.S. citizen born
in June 1915, operates under non-official cover as a retired
immigrant. He is responsible for maintaining contact with
the Station case officer. He is a member of the first for passing
to the Station case officer. He also handles administrative
matters, including agent salary payments. FERNALD is
financially covered under Project AEMAGMIFY.
11. The LIMPTY photographic lnboratory (MEXI-137) is
located in a room at GERNDE's residence. It is equipped
to process the photographs taken by the LIMPTY surveillance
and the LIMPTY publication. He is a member of paragraph 12
below). Since GERNDE will be terminated by the end of
FY 1970, the Station is taking steps to establish a new
LIMPTY photographic laboratory at a new safesith.
12. LIMPTY-4 (201-117967) processes all the photo-
graphic film taken by the LIMPTY photographers and makes
the number of prints required. He does this work at night
in the LIMPTY photographic laboratory. He is self-employed
as a medical doctor, and he is a brotzer-in-law of GERNDE,
in whose home the laboratory is located.

Changes:
1. The LIENTRAP mobile unit, consisting of LIENPTY-10
and LIENPTY-11, is being removed from Project LIEMPTY and
placed under Project LIEMBRACE, which supports a unilateral
physical surveillance team. The purpose of this change is
to increase the size of the LIEMBRACE team in order to meet
the level of the system's internal surveillance support from
the various Station operating areas. The transfer will
become effective at the beginning of FY 1971 and both
FY 1971 project budgets have been adjusted to cover financial
aspects of the change.
2. Raymond H. GERENDE was removed as the LIEMPTY
principal agent in early December 1969 owing to a security
reduction in the program. The program was completed by
8 December 1969 by Bruce H. FERNALD, a career agent oper-
ating under cover as a retired immigrant. The change has
caused some delay in the receipt of photographs because
FERNALD is unable to meet LIEMPTY agents as frequently as
CERNEDE had met then, but operational effectiveness is not
significantly reduced by this delay. The key issue is that
security and reliability of the principal agent have improved
and
Accomplishments:
1. Project LIEMPTY has provided continuous daily
photographic and visual coverage (Monday through Saturday)
of the front entrance and rear areas of the Soviet Embassy
in Mexico City. All Soviet personnel and their visitors
entering or leaving the Embassy have been photographed. In
addition, visual surveillance reports were prepared when
appropriate. These photographs and reports have contributed
essential operational support to the Station's Soviet oper-
ation.
2. Recently, LIEMPTY photographs were exclusively used
to produce an updated mugbook on Soviet officials in Mexico.
The book has been loaned to the FBI, AF/OSI and the 902nd
Military Intelligence Group for operational use in debriefing
their agents engaged in dangle operations and double agent
operations against the Soviet services in Mexico City. One
902nd controlled agent was identified from an LIEMPTY photo-
graph taken when the agent tried to contact the Soviets at


-3-
the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. Similarly, an AF/OSI
controlled agent scheduled to meet a Soviet contact was
unable to do so owing to illness, but LIEMPTY photographed
another person who appeared at the meeting situ and this
person is believed to be the agent's Soviet case officer.
Such coverage has been helpful to the 902nd, AF/OSI and
the FBI in running their controlled double agent operations
against the United States.
The British one week after a biannual change of license
plates on Boviet Embassy vehicles, LIEMPTY had provided a
complete list of the nov tag numbers, along with a complete
identification of the vehicles. Among other things, this
enabled the Station to identify the companions of Aleksandr
Aleksandrovich RIKITIN, a known KEGO officer, during his
last few days in Mexico.
4. LIEMPTY has also determined that newcomers to the
Soviet Embassy frequently gravitic to groupings with their
broadening and a variety of activity" of the Embassy bickyard.
This fact enabled the Station to make certain tentative
KGB and GRU identifications. In addition, certain TDYers
have been linked up with their escort officers and clues
to personal relationships have occasionally been exploited.
5. In the field of Soviet patterns of activity and
associations, LIEMPTY has been able to report accurate
changes in certain specific cases. LIEMPTY coverage showed
that the United States has been able to develop a managed his
activity pattern following the detection of Raisa
Yerofeyevna KIEELNIKOVA, former secretary in the Commercial
Mission in Mexico. The same applies to Oleg NECHIPORENKO,
and the United States has been able to develop a program of
LIEMPTY also provided information on the patterns and
associations of Yuriy Viktorovich KUPLYAKOV, a known KGB
officer and on Valeriy Vladinirovich SPOKOLIN, a known GRU
officer. Coverage of Vladiniir Viktorovich GORDIEVEV, a
victims of the United States. The U.S. Government of the
"restricted area" at the Soviet Embassy and also established
who some of his associates were. In the case of Oleg
Konstantinovich IGNATTEV, who had arrived in Hexico City
from Cracas, Venezuela, LIEMPTY was able to observe
IGNATTEV entering and leaving in the cedpany of Systotelav
Fodorovich KUNSTSOV, Press Attache and Fairei Secretary of
the Soviet Embassy. INNATTY also visited the Soviet Embassy
SECRET


-6-
several other times during his stay in Mexico City and
had contact with other known Soviet inteiligence officers
while visiting. This kind of inforation is a basic
contribution to the Station's continuing efforts to
identify and assess certain Soviets for possible
recruitment or defection.
The work of the SMOs, the Soviet Bloc Division uses
LIBERTY photographs, particularly photographs of Soviet
Embassy officials, for identification purposes in con-
nection with defector cases. The LIMIFTY material also
keeps the Station's Soviet section up-to-date on which
Soviet officers have been in the Embassy, which uses have
been away; who has used which car: who has been in contact
with whom; and other similar information useful in the
Soviet Society operations.
Problees:
1. A security problees has developed involving
Raymond H. GERENDE. According to GREENDE, his wife wants
a divorce, apparently based mainly or incompatability of
personalities. The problee basically is that both want
custody of the children and this has sparked a dispute
of the problem. The problees is a major challenge for the
the monetary settlement is in dispute. The problees is
compounded by the fact that GRENDE's wife knows in some
considerable detail of GERENDE's activities on behalf of
the Agency. Thus, if the case does go to court, it could
be considered to be a good deal of opportunity to stand and
possible compromise of LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP.
Even if the case does not go to court, GERENDE's wife could
be a good deal of opportunity to stand and possible
City Station has been in touch with both GERENDE's
wife on this problees, and every effort is being made by
the Station to have both parties settle the divorce out of
court, and to protect GERENDE's cover and that
the term of the term of the term of the term of the
that continued employment of GERENDE is not an acceptable
risk, and the decision has been reached to terminate him
by the end of FY 1970, GERENDE will be paid a termination
bonus of $10,000 for 15 years service, about $1,250 more
than the $8,750 his contract calls for, in order to ensure
that the termination is anciable and thereby preserve


-7-
project security. In addition, his wife, LIEMPTY-19 will
be given $2,500 as a security measure designed to keep her
from revealing what she knows about project operations.
The FY 1970 budget is being amended to cover this amount.
2. Other aspects of security continue relatively
unchanged. All the agents still have jobs to backstop
their Agency wages. The Station is compartmented from
the
work of the United States. The Union of the
sub-agents is reasonably well covered by his status as a
retired immigrant. FERNALD has been meeting LIEMPTY-9 and
LITEMPY-13 since 9 December 1969. Brief meetings are held
once each week at pre-arranged times and places, well away
with the same time. The Union of the United States, the
called, by phone, if special coverage is desired. FERNALD
also meets LIEMPTY-4 to exchange films and prints. These
meetings are held weekly at pre-arranged times and places.
The Union of the United States, the Union of the United
States, directly by telephone. In addition, LIEMPTY-4 has been
given a special extension in the Station through which he
may call as "Dr. Carlos" to leave a message for "Victor"
(FERNALD). The Station case officer maintains weekly clan-
destine contact with FERNALD in order to manage the oper-
ation and collect the product.
Coordination:
Abuassador McBride has not been briefed on Project
LIEMPTY.
Future Plans:
1. The surveillance units are expected to continue to
produce valuable information in the form of photographic
coverage and visual surveillance reports on the daily
movements, personal associations, and habit patterns of
persons reiquenting the Soviet Embassy, including Soviet
officiais). Operational procedures and the project wecha-
nism will continue as it has in the past, except that Bruce
H, FERNALD, a new principal agent, will be in charge of the
operation of the United States.
2. The Project does not include an up-dated plan for
emergency contact during violent action or government over-
throw. The Station has been requested to prepare an up-
dated emergency contact plan and submit it to Headquarters
in the first FY 1971 quarterly progress report.


Costs:
1. General: $23,635 are requested for FY 1971. It
is requested that the project be amended for FY 1970 in the
amount of $10,498 (from $38,970 to $49,468) in order to
cover termination payments to Anymond H. GREENDE and his
wife, LIAMPTY-19.
3. Source of Funds: Project LIEMPT is included in
the Western Hemisphere Division's FY 1971 Operating Program
in the amount of $40,000. Funds for the FY 1970 amendment
will be absorbed in the current WH Division's finance
allocation.

4. Foreign Currency: There is no special need for
foreign currency. No non-CIA funds are used.
5. Commitments: Christmas bonuses to all agents
totalling $2,354 for FY 1971, and termination pay in an
amount to be determined by the agents record and length
of service.
6. Funding: Funds are hand-carried from the Station
case officer to FERNALD, and from FERNALD to the sub-agente.
The transfer of funds takes place under clandestine meeting
conditions, and appropriate security measures are always
taken.
7. Accountability: FERNALD accounts in detail to his
case officer, who in turn submits receipts to the Station
and certifies that funds were spent to cover expenses for
which it was intended.
8. Annexes: None

SUBJECT
: FY 1970 Renewal of Project LIEMPTY for $38,970
1. Project LIEMPTY, now in its eleventh year, is the Mexican
Station's operation which provides visual and photographic surveil-
lance of the Soviet Embassy from safehouses at the front entrance
and back of the building, as well as from a mobile unit. All Soviet
personnel and their visitors coming to the Embassy are photographed.
The UNION UNION UNION UNION UNION UNION
and
programs were taken and thousands of pages of surveillance reports were
completed by personnel in this project. SB Division is pleased with
the quantity and quality of the photographs and the Station finds then
useful for operational purposes against the SB target. During the
meeting, the Secretary of the Department of the House, the Division in
Mexico City and their photographs were identified by the FBI. There
is a good relationship between the Station and the FBI in Mexico city
and appropriately sterilized photographs are passed locally.
2. There have been no significant security problems.
3. The only changes in the project have been the elimination of
one of the safehouses, which was used as an observation post, and
termination of the agent who attended it. No real loss resulted from
this change since the safehouse was so located that photographs taken
from it overlapped those taken from another safehouse. The agent who
serviced the facility was getting too old to do an efficient job and
was terminated amicably. Also during the past year a new agent was
added to the other.
4. Total funds requested for FY 1970 are $38,970. Salaries and
legally required bonuses for nine agents come to $30,080; safehouse
rental and maintenance amounts to $6,188; maintenance of two vehicles,
$1,200; and photo and operational expenses, $1,500. FY 1969 approval
was for $43,520 and estimated obligations for this period are $43,500.
A new, $5,000 vehicle was purchased in FY 1969 and none is needed in
FY 1970 which accounts for the reduction in costs for the present year.

5. Project LIEMPTY contributes substantially to the Mexican
Station's S8 effort. The occasional identification of U.S. nationals
in contact with the Soviets could have an important bearing on National
Security. The operation is handled by an experienced and capable,
outside contract agent under the direction of a Station officer which
provides good security and personnel economy. It is a well managed and
productive operational support mechanism necessary to Station opera-
tions. If start recommends approval.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT
: LIEMPTY Project Renewal (FY 1970)
1. Renewal is requested for the LIEMPTY Project for
the period 1 July 1969 through 30 June 1970 (FY 1970) in
the amount of $38,970. Funds are available in WH Division.
$45,000 was programmed for FY 1970.
2. LIEMPTY is a project supporting Soviet operations
of the Mexico City Station. It provides for two basohouses,
a photo surveillance vehicle, and personnel for photographic
and video surveillance of the Soviet Embassy. Prossently,
two fixed surveillance bodies are not available in the
location from which the photographs are taken and observers
are stationed. One baschoso is adjacent to the rear of the
Embassy; where Soviet officials meet, play and work. The
members of the United States are not responsible for the
Embassy and gives a direct view of every person entering or
leaving. There is also a mobile photographic unit (a VW
van) which is now used in support of all Mexico City Station
and the means and in conjunction with the LIEMBRACE surveillance
team (used by against Soviet targets). Raymond H.
GERENDE, an industry contract agent, is the principal agent
of the operation and the organization.
and subagents.
3. LIEMPTY contributes significantly to the Station's
Soviet operations program and is considered an essential
element of the Station's support apparatus. During the
period 1 November 1967 through 31 December 1968, approxi-
mately 21,367 photographs were taken. In response to a
request to SB Division for an evaluation of the project, the
following comment was received: "There are few such sources
of
the
information
of
the
publications
of
good side views. These photos are welcomed by SB Division
since they furnish a steady flow of up-to-date identity
data. The photos are useful to the Station in confirming
the identities of Soviet personnel and visitors to the

Exbassy, some of whom are U. S. citizens, During the past
year, several of these U. S. citizens were identified with
the help of the photos (which were passed to the FBI).
Furthermore, the movements and habits of the Soviets are
studied, and more knowledge is acquired on their friends
and associates, especially Mexican nationals. This informa-
tion was made in the 1980s. The 1981s was a major threat
TASS representative, a known KGB officer, is a recruitment
target. He is under intensive operational scrutiny for
leads developed from knowledge of his activities and contacts.
L)};
LEMPITY support is an integral part of this current develop-
mental activity.
4. During the past year, one of the three basehouses
was the following two, and the agent attending it was
terminated. This was done because the agent was becoming
less effective with age, and because there was some over-
lap between the photos taken from this basehouse and those
of another. The termination was amicable, and the working
hours of the personnel of the other basehouse were extended
to the state, and the agent was also hired to help. This new
agent is of the same family as the rest of the personnel
occupying the basehouse, and an additional security risks are
anticipated from this addition.
5. There have been no security or administrative prob-
lems. The Station and GERNDS are constantly on the alert
for any sign that the Soviets are aware of the surveillance
of the bodies, and the other two are not the most important
aware of the surveillance, so far indications are that they
are at least not fully aware, since no effort is made by
them to avoid being photographed, even when having meetings
with contacts in the rear of the Embassy.
6. Approval is recommended of this valuable operational
support project.

The CI Staff concurs in the renewal of this extremely valuable
project. The Staff strongly urges that the Station continue to be
constantly alert for any Sov. interest in the project's agents and
installations and in particular any Sov. investigation or activities
against same-also, Station contingency plans should be formulated
to cope with such Sov. interest or activities.

PROJECT BRIEFING
PROJECT : LIMPTY
MI - Mexico
ACTION : ADD/P approval of renewal (19 mos.)
1 Dec 67 - 30 Jun 69
PURPOSE : An operational support project providing three basehouses and
a mobile surveillance unit to monitor primarily the Soviet
Embassy, its personnel and its visitors, by physical and photo-
graphic surveillance.
BACKGROUND: The project covers three properties near the Soviet Embassy
(two in front of the Embassy's sole entrance and one behind the
gariden) from which visual and photographic surveillance is carried
out. It also covers a darkroom and a mobile photographic truck.
Some of the project personnel are used at times for miscellaneous
support tasks such as servicing portal boxes and for counter-
action, and the other two are not available.
PROCESS: During the past year the project provided nearly all of the opera-
tional photographs and physical surveillance reports used in the
Station's operations against the Soviet Embassy and its personnel.
SB Division says, "This rather unique operation has unquestionably
made a major contribution to the increasingly effective Soviet
Operations program of the Mexico Station."
The project produces primarily operational data and counterintelli-
gence information. It provides leads, evidence of which Soviet
officers have been in the Embassy and which ones have been away,
who has used which car, who has been talking to whom or going out
of the building with whom. (One photograph from this project was
used in the Warren Commission Report.)

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans
THROUGH:
MPS/BG
SUBJECT:
Project LIEMPTY
1. WH Division requests renewal of LIEMPTY for the
19-month period 1 December 1967 through 30 June 1969 in
the amount of $69,725. While this represents a slight
reduction on a pro rata basis from the $45,000 for which
LIEMPTY was approved for the 12-month period starting
1 December 1966, it reflects a proportionately modest
number of 12-month period 1 December 1967, and the
estimated total disbursement of $40,130 for the past
project year. This will provide for small salary increases
to meet the rising cost of living for certain of the agents
involved in the project who have not received raises in
the cost of the agents. The project is based on the
the various basehouses. The project, now in its tenth
year, is designed primarily to provide for the collection
of operational information on the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
and the other parties. The project is based on the
personnel and visitors. To this end, LIEMPTY provides
for the maintenance and exploitation of three basehouses
for fixed visual and photographic surveillance of the
project. The project is based on the project. The
panel truck used for mobile photography against the Polish
Embassy, leaders and meeting sites of local communist
parties, and other targets of opportunity. An important
approach is to provide a comprehensive review of the
the form of countersurveillance for Agency personnel and
operations, including those of other bases and stations
as the needs and requirements of the Mexico Station permit.
The project is based on the project. The project is based on
December 1967 through 30 November 1968 and an additional
$26,205 to cover the period 1 December 1968 through 30
June 1969. The latter funds are asked for in a supple-
mental request to put the project on a fiscal year basis.
2. A long-term contract agent and eight other support
agents are involved in the management and operation of the


14/00/00
LIEMPTY facilities and in surveillance activities directed
at the primary Soviet target. Some of these agents are
used also in dark room photographic processing, letter
drop, and, on occasion, moving surveillance activities.
3. This project is only part of the complex-of
Mexico City Station instruments for meeting requirements
from a number of U.S. agencies, including the FBI. It
is clearly an effective, well-managed support operation
service, and is not.
4. No major or significant changes in LIEMPTY
personnel or operational techniques have been introduced
nor have there been any known incidents adversely
affecting the security of the project or its personnel
since the previous project renewal period. As a unit
project has been completed, it is not possible to
be a most useful station asset supporting a number of
station activities. In spite of small increases in costs
as discussed above, the project is considered to be holding
the line on cost and personnel.
5. The objectives of project LIEMPTY are in direct
support of priority A objectives 1, 2, and 4 of the current
project. The objectives are based on the by SB
Division to have made significant contributions to the
Station's well developed, high priority Soviet Operations
Program. During the past year the various LIEMPTY base-
ures established in the project, the project is to be
more in the public coverage and physical surveillance
reports on the daily movements, personal associations and
habit patterns of selected targets of special interest.
In numerous instances this coverage confirmed the specific
requirements of the project, the project is to be
Embassy. Often the identities of Mexicans and nationals of
other countries in contact with the Soviets were estab-
lished. The mobile panel truck unit was exploited regu-
larly to provide information on not only the Soviets but
also the Cuban target as well as local Communist Party
targets.

PROJECT BRIEFING
PROJECT: LIEMPTY
WH - Mexico City
ACTION : ADD/P approval of renewal
1 Dec 66 - 30 Nov 67
PURPOSE: Provides stationary surveillance against the Soviet Embassy
and a mobile photographic baschouse which is used primarily
against the Polish Embassy and local Communist party leaders.
PROGRESS: Three basehouses (LIMITED, LLLYRIC and LICALLA) pro-
vide coverage of both the front and rear of the Soviet Embassy.
Throughout the past renewal period each operational component
contributed actively and concretely to the fulfillment of the
operational tasks levied on the Station. In the first nine-month
period approximately 17, 000 individual frames of operational
photographs were provided from the fixed basehouses. These
served to confirm the identities of Employment and
Employment. The 100% employment reporting on the movement
and habit patterns of selected targets of special interest. The
mobile unit (LIENTRAP) provided over 1, 000 individual photo-
graphs. Of particular value were photographs of local and
exile Communist leaders. Raymond H. GERENDE (p) continued
in the role as principal agent for Project LIEMPTY. His overall
operational assignment involved at least 12 clandestine meetings
per week, in addition to his meetings with the LIEMPTY project
case officer.
PROBLEMS: In mid 1966 LICOWL/1, who owns a small store near the
Soviet Embassy, reported that a Soviet official had approached
him and asked him to inform on his neighbors. Reportedly the
Soviet named LIEMPTY/6 of the LIMITED basehouse by name
and also asked about the tenants of the building housing LILYRIC,
However, in view of LICOWL's previous history of lying, it is
difficult to assess exactly what the Soviets requested and just
what LICOWL/1 may have told them. The Station is still looking
into this development.

CISTAFF: Strongly urges the Station to continue its close
monitoring of Soviet interest in the installation buildings and
attenees to obtain information on sensitive project personali-
ties. The Station should devise necessary contingency plans
of action to eliminate any security hazards if it is determined
that the Soviets are intensifying such efforts and could be
getting "too close" to the project installations, personalities
and activities.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT
: LIENPTY Project Renewal
1. It is requested that the LIENPTY Project be
renewed for the period 1 December 1966 through 30
November 1967 for a total of $45,000: $29,020 for
FY 1967 and $15,980 for FY 1968. The Project is in-
cluded in the FY 1967 Operational Program for $45,000,
Funds are available within WH Division.
2. LIENPTY covers stationary surveillance base-
houses targeted against the Soviet Embassy. These
procedures were not available in the U.S. and logs. Two
of the basehouses (LIMITED and LILLYRIC) cover the
activity in the front of the Embassy, and LICALLA provides
coverage of the back courtyard area. The LIENPTY project
also covers a mobile photographic basehouse in the form
of a panel truck which is used against the Polish Embassy
where we have no permanent surveillance basehouse, and
against the U.S. and local public buildings.
3. The value of Soviet Embassy photographic cover-
age during the past year was proven when the logs
maintained by LILLYRIC wore used to double check on an
operation involving LIRUSTIC-1 and LICOWL-1 who had told
the U.S. and local public buildings. The U.S. and local
activity of some Soviets. Through the surveillance
reports of the LIENPTY Project against the Soviet Embassy,
it was proven without a doubt that LICOWL-1 (who had just
taken a polygraph without apparent deception) was lying
about his contacts with the Soviets.
4. The LIENTRAP mobile photographic basehouse was
targeted against leaders and meeting sites of the local
Communist parties as well as other targets of opportunity,
particularly exile Communist leaders now residing in
Mexico. LIENTRAP provided up-dated identification

photographs of Communist officers which are of value
to both the JMTIGER program and the Station's
recruitment/penetration program. The LIENTRAP
personnel also regularly service twenty-one postal
accommodation addresses used by the Mexico City
Station.
One of the development which may affect the security
of the LIENTRAP basehouses of LIMITED and ALLYRIC
occurred in mid 1966 when LICOWL-1 (who owns a small
store near the Soviet Embassy) reported that a Soviet
official, AEQUALITY-1, had approached him and
requested him to inform on his neighbors. Reportedly
the Soviet named LIENTPY-6 (of the LIMITED basehouse)
and the United States had moved to the Union. The
of the new building had now houses ALLYRIC. The
Soviet pinpointed the building by saying the one being
built by a person who fit perfectly the description of
LINOUSINE. LICOWL-1 did not indicate that the Soviet
contract was a major challenge for the Union of
the LILYRIC basehouse were not mentioned. LICOWL-1
indicated to his Station contact that the only person
he really suspected in the neighborhood was LIEMPTY-6
(who was not interested in the production of the
lives comfortably, and owns a car. He claims to have
heard it rumored that LIEMPTY-6 was working for the
Americans. (Since LIMITED is equipped with a radio
and tips of the Station's surveillance team when it
is used against Soviet targets. Hadquartet, a
discretionary of the Union of the Soviet Union) identified this
basehouse.) LICOWL-1 has been open persons
named by the Soviet who had no connection whatsoever
with CIA.
6. The Station instructed LICOWL-1 not to become
an alien company, a telephone company to LICOWL-1,
he therefore told AEQUALITY-1 he did not have
collect the information the Soviet wanted. However,
in view of the lies LICOWL-1 has been caught in, it
is difficult to assess exactly what the Soviets asked
of LICOWL-1 and just what LICOWL-1 may have told the
Soviets. The Station is still looking into this develop-
ment.
7. WHD recommends renewal of this Project.

PREVIOUS PROJECT ACTION


PROJECT: LIEMPTY
ACTION : ADD/P approval of renewal
PURPOSE: To provide support for mobile and stationary photographic
surveillance of the Soviet Embassy and a dispatching base
for a physical surveillance team.
PROGRESS: Assets included under the project include three base-
houses which provide front and rear views of the Soviet
Embassy, and a panel truck equipped for spot photo
coverage. Raymond H. GERENDE (p), principal agent,
meets the basehouse keepers regularly, maintains regular
contact with the mobile photo unit and with the develop-
ing and testing base. He also performs many other
support functions.
The photographs from all these operations have been of
value to the Station in operational planning, for
identification by surveillance teams, for mug books, and
for Headquarters permanent files. The Station believes
that this operation is essential to the fulfillment of
the overall operational program levied on the Station by
the RND.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans
THROUGH:
DDP/FG
SUBJECT:
Project LIMPTY Renewal
1. FI Staff recommends approval of the renewal of Project
LEMPITY. This project, costed at $41,500., supports the following
Mexico City assets: a panel truck used for mobile photography,
three base houses for fixed photographic surveillance, a contract
agent manager and eight support agents. One of the base homes is
used as a control plant, which is a new service team. (The
lattered project of the project, however.)
2. The LIMPTY target is the Soviet Embassy and Soviet
activities in Mexico City. LIMPTY is part of the complex of
station instruments by means of which requirements from a variety
of U.S. agencies are met. One of the sites provided pictures
later used in the Warren Commission Report, and the publication
of the report created a security hazard. The Station moved the
site and it is now back in operation.
3. The possibility of Soviet intercept of radio comno to
the surveillance team has been carefully weighed recently by SR,
the desk, O/C and TSD. The decision to accept the risk appears
to have been taken with the deliberation.
4. This is clearly an effective, well-manned operation
serving an important need. We recommend renewal without hesitation.

SUBJECT
:
Project LIEMPTY Renewal Request
1. Renewal is requested for the LIEMPTY Project for
the period 1 December 1965 through 30 November 1966 for a
total of $41,500; of this amount, $25,520 should be
alloted for FY 1966 and $15,980 for FY 1967. This Project
has been programmed in FY 1966 for $50,000. The last
Project Renewal was approved at $45,300. Funds are
available at the end of 1966.
2. The security of this Project appears to be good.
The LIE INRAP photo truck was repainted a different color
in January 1965 to preserve the security of this vehicle
which operates extensively in the same general areas. There
have been no apparent ramifications from the publication
of the LIMITED Photograph in the Warren Commission Report
in September 1966.
3. The AP is one of two mobile photo surveillance
units at the Station, both of which are used extensively
because of the many requirements for spot photo coverage
of diplomatic installations, agent meetings, and current
identification photos of targets among others.
4. Although there are three stationary photo
baschouses under this Project all targeted against the
Soviet Embassy, there is very little duplication of
effort, and the coverage of this Embassy would be weakened
in the United States. The U.S. Government of the United
the rear of the Embassy (garden and parking lot) and is
in a unique position to observe informal meetings and
activity there. In May 1965 a thorough assessment was
made of this basehouse to determine whether an audit
is not a reasonable basis for the U.S. Government of the
garden conversations. It was determined that due to the
high incidence of street and other noises, this was not
practical. TSD and SR Divisions are conscious of this
requirement, however, and if any new equipment
developed which might make this operation more feasible
to be used. The U.S. Government of the High both cover
the front entrance, provide coverage during different
parts of the day, and LIMITED also serves as a fixed radio

dispatching base for the LIEIMBRACE surveillance team.
S. The photographs from all these operations are of
value to the Station in their operational planning, for
identification by surveillance teams, for mug books, which
are often used by surveillance teams and singleton agents
in identifying Soviets, and for Headquarter's permanent
files.
With reference to the FI Staff comment made last
year at the time of the Project renewal that the radio dis-
patching from the LIMITED installation might have made this
base a target for the RIS, the problem was discussed in depth
with the Office of Communications, TSD, and SR Divisions.
The Station has been alert to the Soviet's monitoring capa-
tion. The proposed plan is to be prepared by the Department
car communications system that will leave the LIEIMBRACE
surveillance cars on the air for a minimum of time, and
with limited open conversation. The result of Headquarters
and the Station's research on this problem resulted in the
concentration of the radio and radio systems. The proposed
automobiles, radios must be used if there is to be efficient
surveillance; and regardless of what presently availab le
type of scrambling or coding is used, radio is susceptible
to the radio and radio systems. The proposed plan is included
that if the Station is to use the LIEIMBRACE team against
members of the Soviet installation, LIMITED must continue to
be used as the radio dispatching center and the risk factor
must be accepted until some new, more secure yet efficient
common system is devised.
7. The reporting on the administration of this Project
is handled through regular quarterly progress reports. The
appropriate Soviet, CP, or other Case Officers handle the
reporting and exploitation of the product. During the past
year there were no positive intelligence reports from this
project.
8. Both SR and WH Divisions recommend renewal of this
Project.

sents a clear picture of the aims and objectives of the
various segments, it does not provide, except in the
case of ECHRLLING, detailed indication of the value or
adventines of the other segment; particularly the photo-
nography of the system, and the present work is the
vide such an appraisal during the first quarter of 1960.
FI/OPS recommends strongly that the photo coverage be
reviewed from the standpoint of value and usefulness with
a view to determining whether the LILINIC activity could
be used to determine the quality of the data. The

material; affecting overall usefulness. FI/OPS notes
that, in the absence of further proof of usefulness, the

: Project LEXPTY Amendment
Name: J. B. Brady
Room: 2114, Barton :all
ct. : 2555
Date: 23 June 1959
1. It is requested that approval be granted to amend Raymond H. GRENDE'S
contract to provide him with a termination settlement of one month's salary for
each full year that he works for KUEARK and to raise his salary effective July
1959 from 31,000 to 41,560.00 per year. Its last salary increase was granted on
the date of the date of the date, 18 March 1955, has been suggested by the Station as
the b-ginning date for the computation of CUNDRY's termination benefits. The
Station believes that this修正 bill provides GRENDE's with the necessary
incentive to make KUSARK a cancer and it the same time will give the station an
additional element of control.
2. As pointed out in the LEXPTY Project Approval, GRENDE, an indigenous
agent, is one of the Station's own and the National Council for a reasonable full
year. The National Agent who handles the LEXPTY Project. The National
LICALLA base houses, the LEXPTAP operation, the outside photographic proceedings
and translation service and all the agents participating in these activities.
He performs his duties in a conscientious and professional manner and his
already excellent abilities are showing continued improvement.
3. None: was already allocated in the LEXPTY Project approval for the
salary increase. With the effective date of 13 March 1955, for the termination
clause, OSELES will already have accrued 1,520 (his salary is 54,560 per year)
if he should resign today. The LEXPTY Project, as approved, has sufficient
funds to cover this costs if it is necessary to obligate this amount during the
present Project year. Therefore, no additional funds are requested.

1. It is requested that approval be granted to give Oliver G. SCANTLING a
special benefit of one year's salary to him or his assigned heirs in the event of
loss of like or total disability if incurred in the performance of duty. This
benefit was included in a contract prepared in the field and signed by Subject on
15 February 1957. The contract was not submitted to Headquarters for approval
until December 1958. The Station and W/ Division do not want to dolto this
benefit from Subject's contract at this time and we feel Subject deserves this
benefits.
1. The SANTLING, a civil engineer, is at American citizen, who is not years old.
He was granted an operational Approval on 2 December 1956. SCANTLING began his
employment with USARK as a footman on the LIPSTICK physical surveillance team and
gradually became a driver of a surveillance automobile, then team leader. As team
leader ho was responsible for the operational deployment and administrative direction
of the entire LITSTICK team, three automobiles, four photographic and radio dispatching
basshungs, and the industry, and stationary radio equipment. He collated the
FREQUENCY surveillance reports into the intelligence reports for study by the
Case Officer. SCANTLING developed into a fine station and has obtained incor-
nates. Here other Station investigative assets have been
3. Almost all of SCANTLING's time now is spent following up leads obtained
from telephone intercepts and photographic surveillance. From July through
December 1958 he made asproaches to individuals performing services for the Soviet
December 1958 he made asproaches to individuals performing services for the Soviet
and other country coordinated casing report of the West German Embassy. In addition,
he conducted many traditional and technical work, the U.S. Government to
have SCATLING attempt to recruit the landlord of the proposed baseliousa for a
LITZENT (FZ/D) operation. SCANTLING no longer handles the surveillance team and the
Station plans to continue to use him as an independent asset. SCATLLIG has in his
possession official credentials of the Federal Security Police (DNS). He has used
these credentials in making contacts with targets of various sensitive Headquarters'
operations and to the U.S. Government.
1. As a graduate engineer who has spent at least ten years in house construction
in Mexico, he has been invaluable to the Station in submitting detailed casing reports,
including detailed and professional plans of technical targets. He has been con-ended
by TSS for the support role he has played for them. He has submitted several caning
reports on the Soviet Embassy and is an unparalleled source of information to the
Station for information about the Embassy's construction activities, modifications
and reasons for save.

5. For your information there is attached the Statin's review of SCUTING
for the period July through December 1958. It is believed you will find this report
of interest and further support the justification outlined above for the granting to
SCANTLING of the special death and disability benefit. This agent assessment states
"Oliver 0. SCANTLING has continued to perform his assigned stake in an outstanding
manner. SCANTLING's poise, common sense, education, ideology, and native ability
to be a "socialist" program. The "Socistic" program is a "Socistic" program. The
assets available to the Mexico City Station. The fact that SCANTLING has a full
tio: overt occupation as Chief Engineer and Production Manager for a local mam-
facturing company adds to his long-range potential as a KUEAKK agent". SCANTLING
has excellent cover as half-omer of a local firm which manufactures farm instru-
ments and he represents the high calibro of person which KUEAKK requires for the
institution of their long-term recipient agent program.
6. The LIEPTY Project (now approved for $95,230) will not be amongst at this
time to include an extra year's salary for SCANTING (14,000). In the event it
becomes necessary to fulfill this commitment during the project year, and if the
income cannot be absorbed by the present project authorization, an amendment will
be used to make a new plan.
7. It is also requested that effective 1 March 1959 the LIEWTY Project be
ansmended to include LouieJ. MAGINO, a Contract Agent, who is a Station support
asset. Her OA was reinstated on 8 August 1958 (C-LL152). She was formerly included
under Project LIMEAT. However, the Station requirements for general translation
and the development of the Project was a new program. The new program is not
other than those originating: from LIEFAT. It was therefore decided it would be more
appropriate to include her Under LIEMPTY. She does trying of reports and non-sensitive
translations. She is paid on an hourly basis of $2.32, an estimated yearly salary of
33,500. The Station stated that the present LIMEAT Project could absorb the expense
of her salary for the remainder of the Project year.

WH - Mexico City
1. The attached project, originating in WH Division, is presented
for your approval for an initial period from 1 December 1958 through
30 November 1959. The project provides for the development of operational
information through physical and photographic surveillance operations in
support of other Mexico City operations, particularly those targeted at
Soviet personnel and installations. Previously these operations were con-
ducted for the most part under Projects LIFSTICK and LIFESSEY. They are
incorporated in this new project because of the June 1958 companies of
LIFSTICK and to accomplish a more orderly administration of certain opera-
tions and services.

individuals of operational interest, and to rent rooms, and apartments and
porters other support activities. The fixed surveillance bases, LIMITING,
LLTRIC and LICALLA, have been in operation for almost three years without
having been in any compromising situations insofar as the Station knows.
The LIPSTICK unit, a panel truck equipped with cameras, etc., is considered
a particularly valuable asset by the Field. As a replacement for a staff
is a large number of buildings, the LIPSTICK unit is a large number of
lance team, the husband and wife team of CLACKETT and FIRDRALIS are proposed
as qualified individuals to recruit, train, and direct the new LIMPTI sur-
veillance team and maintain its records. Appropriate notional cover was
arranged for them while in their previous project, LDERSA, as they reside in
Mexico under trus names. One of the most important people will have no
contact with the new surveillance team, but will be used to continue their
investigation. The LIPSTICK unit's plans are: 1) LDERSA, 2) LDERSA, 3) LDERSA, 4) LDERSA, 5) LDERSA, 6) LDERSA, 7) LDERSA, 8) LDERSA, 9) LDERSA, 10) LDERSA, 11) LDERSA, 12) LDERSA, 13) LDERSA, 14) LDERSA, 15)

Request for Amendment to LIFETY Project
1. It is requested that the LIFETY Project approval request be
amended to include Simon D. CLACKETT (ps) and wilma J. FIONCALISI (ps),
U. S. citizens and contract agents, under this Project in place of the
Staff Agent written into the Field project outline. At the same time it is
requested that the LIFESA Project be amended to delete these contract
agents and the following:
2. CLACKETT and FIONCALISI are not approved under the LIFESA Project.
They were recruited in the United States to occupy a sensitive LIMESA base-
house. Because of the sensitivity of the operation and the equipment to be
installed in the bsehouse Headquarters decided U. S. citizens should be
used. The Station said appropriate documentation and backstepping could
be secured for those agents so they could be given false identities under
which the LIFESA Project is not available.
3. LEXIL-2777 (IN 26519), of 14 November 1958, notified Headquarters
that security factors and difficulty in obtaining adequate documentation
and backstepping precluded the use of U. S. citizens under LIMESA and re-
quested permission to use indigenous agents for this operation. After dis-
cussions between John BND, Chief of the Mexican desk, with the LIMESA/
LIMESA? Care Officer in Mexico City, and discussions between representa-
tions, and the development of the United States, and the Department of
the field's operational decision to use indigenous agents in the LIMESA
Project. CLACKETT and FIONCALISI received only a very superficial briefing
regarding the LIMESA Project. It is not believed Subject's limited know-
ledge of this sensitive operation will pose a security hazard.
4. Construction on the LIMEST houses is being kept about two weeks
from completion until indigenous agents can be cleared and recruited. The
delay in completion is normal because all construction money in Mexico has
become extremely tight because of the current presidential innovation.
5. LIMESA Project CLACKETT and FIONCALISI will be submitted for
Wilfred O. CLACKETT (ps), former Staff Agent under Project LIFELK, who
directed and trained that surveillance team. CLACKETT has shown a remarkable
aptitude for clandestine operational activity and surveillance and investi-
gative work in particular. He also is interested and enthusiastic in under-
taking this assignment for KUB.MK. The Station needs a good bilingual agent
to recruit, train, direct, and develop a strong dependable physical. surveil-
lance team under this project.
6. LIMESA Project, covers and Contacts: CLACKETT was granted a PDCA on 23 July 1958.
A POA/OA for use under LIMESA was requested on 19 August 1958. FIONALISI
was granted an O4 for use under LIMESA on 14 November 1958. Requests have
been submitted to amend their clearances for use under LIMETY, CLCKETT
and FIONALISI have signed contracts effective 1 September 1958. The
sensitivity of the LIMESA Project required them to leave their young son in

the United States. Because of this a special benefit of periodic trips to
their home in Arizona was included in their contracts. Under LINESA their
quarters were to be provided. An amendment has been requested to their
contracts deleting the special benefit and adding educational and quarters
allowances.
7. Notification and Control: CLACKETT and FIERDALISI are extremely
partiotic and highly motivated as evidenced in their willingness to under-
take the LINESA Project and be separated from their son. They have indi-
cated they are more than willing to do whatever is requesteot of them, no
matter who is not a member of the family. This are required. Their com-
plete information is dependent on the current situation.
8. Tasks: CLACKETT will recruit, train, and direct the LEXPYY
surveillance team. The Station hoes to develop this team into a major
Station support asset. tie will receive instructions and direction from the
Station Case Officer. FIERDALISI will be used to do all the clerical and
administrative work for the LEXPYY surveillance team.
9. Communication and Contect: CLACKETT will contact the Station Case
Officer in a clandestine manner. All necessary security precautions will be
taken. CLACKETT will also contact his surveillance agents under a cover
of the LEXPYY. The Station has a number of services and services
Mexican background, CLACKETT can pass as a Mexican. Details of communication
and contact arrangements with KENZEN will be arranged by the Station. Under
LINESY CLACKETT will be contacted by the same Case Officer he is now con-
tacted by under LINESA. CLACKETT and FIERDALISI will be in direct contact
with relatives and Friends in the United States. The cover company has,
until now, been serving as a letter drop and contact point for emergency
assistance.
10. Cover: CLACKETT and FIERDALISI entered Mexico on United States
documentation and it is planned they will continue to live in Mexico under
true name. CLACKETT has a notional cover as a public relations consultant
which was established by COD/NC to use with friends and relatives in the U. S.
The same cover story can be adopted to cover their proposed use under LEMPSY
vis-aviogmentr United States Friends. The Station is working on local cover
for the City of New York.
11. Anticipated Costs: It is anticipated that the following expenses
will be incurred by CLACKETT and FIERDALISI:
Compensation:

SUBJECT
1. Justification for Automobiles under Project LIMIT
1. It is requested that the Mexico City Station be authorized to
purchase three used sedans for use by the LIMITY surveillance team. The
Station plans to expand the LIMITY surveillance team into a larger, well-
trained physical surveillance asset. They will need three automobiles.
Private automobiles or commercial transportation will not be satisfactory
since the cars must be outfitted with two-way radios.
2. Authority is also requested to purchase a panel truck to be used
in the LENTRAP operation under this Project which mounts mobile photo-
graphic surveillance.
3. It is also requested that a quasi-personal car be authorised for
Oliver Q. Scantling (ps). Scantling is an indigenous agent under oral
contract. A car is a prerequisite for his work for KURARK which includes
casings, surveillance, and investigations. Because of the sensitive
nature of his work, and the heavy use made of the car, the Station has
decided a new vehicle for the car.
4. LENTPLY agents were formerly carried under the LIFERSBY and
LIPSTICK Projects. The vehicles used by the LIFEMTY agents under these
other Projects will be disposed of and new ones will be purchased after
the above TVA has been approved. The vehicles which will be replaced
with the LIFEMTY agents. The vehicles are not available to the
cars will be new and will not replace an old car. It was decided that
these vehicles should be replaced rather than transferred to the LIMEMTY
Project, for security reasons and because of the a go of the automobiles.
The LIFEMTY agents are not available to the car. The vehicles are not
surveillance work for over two years. The panel truck which was used in
the LENTRAP Operation under the LIFSTICK Project has been operating for
two years in all parts of the city and has become a security threat. The
fact that the LIPSTICK surveillance team knows that the truck exists,
even to the point that one of the team members is the listed owner of the
truck, also dictates replacement of this vehicle.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Chief, NH Division
SUBJECT:
KDFACTOR Project Amendment and Termination
1. The KDFACTOR Project, which provided photographic
surveillance from two vantage points of the Soviet compound
in Mexico City, was determined to be compromised due to the
VWBLANKET case. The five agents were terminated in July
1972, but the base houses could not be terminated until
January 1973 because it was necessary to sell one and the
termination of the second was tied to the termination of
KOBBEY who owned the second base house. It was necessary
to pay rent for several extra months until these other
terminations could be effected.
2. The base houses and agents have now all been ter-
minated and the Station already has rented a replacement
safehouse with new agents to provide the same coverage
(KDALCOVE).
3. Approval of the amendment and termination of
Project KDFACTOR is recommended.

attached.
2. The report discusses the history of the opera-
tion, describes security problems of the past and steps
taken to remedy them, and discusses the security and
operational situation of the agents presently covered
by the project. The report notes that the two opera-
tion is based on the type of security review. The

now being done inside the Station. One section of the
report discusses in detail the assets who were formerly
used to provide a security review. The registration of the
The final section of the report describes current specu-
rity practices and notes that an alternate photographic
surveillance site has been procured and is available
for use should the present one be compromised.

SUBJECT
: FI Project KDFACTOR, Security Review
REFERENCE
: ADDP Memo (DD/P 1-5899) to C/WHD dated
14 December 1971
1. In response to reference the following is a summary of the
KDFACTOR security review:
The Station summary of the KDFACTOR Project security is
as follows:
"There were no known problems of security relating to
the Project. In response to the Headquarters request, we have
reviewed all phases of the operation and believe that Project
security is sound. The Project assets have all been with us for
many years and have established themselves as respectable long-
time residents of the area. All five assets, four in one family
and one in another, are extremely security conscious and have
all been SGSWIRLED. The assets derive a substantial portion
of their livelihood from their Agency employment and would thus
lose a great deal if security factors ever necessitated a termina-
tion of their work for us. As an additional safeguard, the
KDLITERAL, and KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented
from each other, and there has never been any indication that
either segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's existence!
The Headquarters desk has also reviewed the security of the
KDFACTOR Project and agrees with the Station that the security
is sound. In fact, as presently constituted, the KDFACTOR
Project is well compartmented, and each of the two KDFACTOR
photo basehouses (KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) is run by long-
term assets who draw a minimum of suspicion in their operational
activities. Terminated assets could possibly expose the existence

of this project, but that seems unlikely from the Headquarters
review of terminated agents wilting of present KDFACTOR
operational activities. A Soviet investigation of property owner-
ship around the Soviet Embassy and their awareness that the
Soviet Embassy was under photographic surveillance in the past
could result in a Soviet investigation of the activities and contacts
of KDABBEY-1, the owner of an apartment building and four
houses close to the Soviet Embassy. It is doubtful that KDABBEY-1's
activities, which do not inter-relate with the activities of the
KDFACTOR agents, would in any way expose the KDFACTOR
Project operational activities.
2. A brief history of the KDFACTOR Project:
The KDFACTOR Project had its origins in the LIVERSEY
and LIDSTICK Projects, both active in the mid-1950's. In 1958, after
the arrest of two LIDSTICK surveillance team members, it was decided
to break off the more sensitive, uncompromised LIDSTICK assets manning
and supporting two basehouses for photo surveillance of the Soviet Embassy.
These assets were consolidated with one photo basehouse against the Soviet
Embassy and one surveillance team from the LIVERSEY Project into a new
project (LEIMPTY), which was approved on 16 January 1959. The LIMPTY
Project, renamed the KDFACTOR Project in 1971, consisted of three photo
basehouses, two viewing the front of the Soviet Embassy (LIMITED and
LILYRIC) and one viewing the rear garden of the Soviet Embassy (ICALLA),
plus a mobile surveillance team (LEINTRAP) tied closely with the LIMITED
basehouse, which was the radio control point for dispatch of the LENTRAP.
In 1959 the LENTRAP surveillance vehicle and two team
members were arrested at the scene of a Cuban demonstration in Mexico
City. A Station review of the security implications of this incident stated
that it did not materially affect the security of the project nor expose any
of the LEMPTY basehouse operations. (Note: As the basehouse operations
were compartmented, the only exposure possible from this incident would
have been of the LIMITED basehouse, which is no longer in existence, )
The LIMPTY Project operated substantially as above until
the Warren Commission report was published in late 1964. In this publica-
tion was a picture of a person entering the Soviet Embassy taken from the
LIMITED basehouse. The LIMITED photo basehouse was closed in Sept-
ember 1964, and all photographic surveillance was suspended as a security
precaution. In January 1965 the LIMTED basehouse was relocated, and

later that year the building it had previously been in was razed by the
owner, K0ABBEY-1. From 1964 on it must be assumed that the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico City believes it is under regular photographic sur-
veillance.
Further project changes took place in 1966 when the LILYRIC
basehouse was relocated to another apartment with approximately the
same view. In May 1968 the LIMITED basehouse was terminated and
LIEMPTY-6, the basehouse keeper, retired. This affected the LIEINTRAP
coverage of Soviet vehicular movement monitored and directed from the
LIMITED basehouse. With the closing of LIMITED and the Station decision
to replace Raymond H. GERENDE, Mexican national contract agent who
handled the LIEMPTY Project since its inception, the LIEINTRAP mobile
surveillance team was underemployed, and the decision was made to move
it to the LIEIMBRACE Project. This was done in early 1970, soon after
GERENDE had been relieved of operational responsibilities in December
1969.
The photo processing of the K0BACTOR (formerly LIEMPTY)
film take is now being done by the Station. In the past, it was done by
the Station, by GERENDE, and by K0BACTOR-1, who was terminated
amicably in early 1971. The building housing the K0LITERAL (formerly
LICALLA) photo basehouse was purchased in 1957 by K0DABBEY-1 for
the Station. K0LITERAL is in a row of four houses all owned ostensibly
by K0DABBEY-1 but actually by the Agency. This row also houses a base-
house for FID's K0VALLT Project. The apartment building housing the
K0DABSINTHE (formerly LILYRIC) photo basehouse is owned outright by
K0DABBEY-1, who has been most cooperative in assisting the Station in
maintaining and occasionally moving (1965 and 1966) photo basehouses.
The LIMITED photo basehouse was also located on K0DABBEY-1's property
when it was active.
The individual basehouse operations are and have always been
compartmented one from the other. The only points of breakdown in the
compartmentation have been: (a) the LIMITED basehouse was linked to
the LIEINTRAP mobile surveillance; (b) K0FACTOR-1 was processing
films from all the basehouses and could, therefore, be aware of their
exact locations; (c) GERENDE was aware of all aspects of the K0DACTOR
operation, and has since been terminated; (d) Oliver G. SCANTLING,
Station contract agent retired in 1971, was aware of the K0FACTOR Project

through his past work with LIEMPTY-6 and with GERENDE on KDFACTOR
Project activities; and (e) the fact that the two present basehouse properties
are owned by KDABBEY-1, who is writing of the locations and general
activity of both KDFACTOR basehouses.

KDFACTOR-10 of KDV AULT and
KDFACTOR basehouses.
Regarding the security of the above active KDFACTOR agents,
the KDLITERAL basehouse is handled by KDFACTOR-2 with the assistance
of his wife, KDFACTOR-10. They have a long-time maid and a 13-year-
old son who lives with them in the basehouse. Neither the son nor the maid
is believed to be witing. The photographic equipment is kept in a locked
room, and the product is kept in a locked safe. KDFACTOR-2 was recruited
by KDCALVERT-1, who is an active, long-term Station agent in the
KDCALVERT Project and who is not considered a threat to KDFACTOR-2's
security. KDFACTOR-2's activities are also known to his brother, the
former LIPSTICK-47, who was one of the two LIPSTICK surveillance team
members arrested in 1958 and who gave the police considerable information
regarding LIPSTICK surveillance activities. LIPSTICK-47 was terminated
in late 1958 and is believed to have withheld from the police the information
regarding KDFACTOR-2 and the KDLITERAL basehouse. KDFACTOR-2
and his family have occupied the KDLITERAL basehouse since 1957 and
and has already street and security conscious in their dealings with neighbors
and relatives.

The KDABSINTHE basehouse is manned by KDFACTOR-5, his
wife KDFACTOR-6, and his two sons KDFACTOR-8 and KDFACTOR-9.
The SGSWIRL of 2 March 1966 went into detail on who is writing of
KDFACTOR-5's work for the Station. The result was that his immediate
family, including a married daughter who no longer lives at the basehouse,
are aware of the photographic operation. KDFACTOR-5 was recruited by
LIEMPTY-12, a U. S. citizen with a private company in Mexico City who
is no longer working with the Station but who is considered patriotic and
no threat to KDFACTOR security.
4. Terminated Agents Possibly Affecting Present Project Security:
A. Raymond H. GERENDE
GERENDE is a Mexican citizen and was a contract agent
until his termination on 26 June 1970. He had been employed by the Station
Intermittently since 1955 and was used almost exclusively in support activities.
Since the start of the LIEMPTY Project in 1958 GERENDE had been directly
involved with this project serving as cutout to the basehouses, carrying and
processing films, and giving general direction to the project as principal
agent. In 1969, after years of excellent service with the Station, GERENDE
had serious marital problems which ended in separation from his wife,
KDFACTOR-7. From December 1969 to June 1970 GERENDE was not used
operationally but was maintained on half pay with the hope the divorce pro-
cessions of the United States, and the family was not used in the divorce
would drag on interminably, the Station reluctantly terminated the GERENDE
and his wife. Bruce H. FERNALD, career agent, met with GERENDE
monthly from July 1970 through May 1971 while paying him his termination
bonus in ten installments. GERENDE is still living in Mexico City, where
he owns some property and has an income as an English teacher to employees
of two local firms. He visited his wife and children in Holland in December
1970. It appears he may now be financially pressed as his English class
schedule has been cut back. The Station as of 10 April 1972 had no informa-
tion that would indicate GERENDE has violated his secrecy agreement.
There is an indication that GERENDE came to the attention
of the Soviets in 1968. A Mexican walk-in to the FBI office in Mexico City,
who was later interrogated by the Federal Security Police in 1970, said
that in 1968 he had been employed by the Soviet Embassy Second Secretary,
Oleg Makskimovich Nechiporenko (201-305870), to investigate persons
working with the Mexican Olympic Committee. The persons investigated

Included GERENDE, who apparently became a specific target of Soviet
investigation. It is unclear from the report of the Federal Security Police
how far the Soviet-investigation of GERENDE had proceeded. Nechiporenko
was PNG'd from Mexico in March 1971. GERENDE's possible exposure to
the Soviets could have been through his work on the Olympic Committee as
a translator or through his work for the Station, which used him for a wide
range of support tasks against the Soviet and Cuban targets.
B. KDFACTOR-7 (wife of GERENDE)
KDFACTOR-7 is a Dutch citizen and the former wife of
GERENDE. She returned to the Netherlands in July 1970 with her children.
She had served as a support agent assisting GERENDE. She is believed
witting, in general terms, of GERENDE's activities regarding the KDFACTOR
program. He was a member of the KDFACTOR-7 and his father, a
agreement and quit claim. After termination it became apparent that she
had considerable hard feelings toward both the Agency and GERENDE over
financial-problems between her family and GERENDE. While the Station
was not directly involved in all the financial problems, the Station was
involved in regard to her divorce claims against GERENDE's salary, a
large part of which came covertly from the Station. In July 1970 KDFACTOR-7
came to the Agency Headquarters and complained about her financial settle-
ment. In September and November 1970 she wrote two letters directly to
the KDFACTOR-7 and his father, a former wife of GERENDE, was a
political officer to put her in contact with the Agency; however, she did not
tell him the nature of her business. In January 1971 the Agency contacted
KDFACTOR-'s brother, a U. S. Army civilian with a "Top Secret" clearance
living in Alexandria, Virginia, and was able to resolve the financial mis-
understandings with KDFACTOR-7. In January 1971 the Hague Station
reported KDFACTOR had, without Station influence, obtained a job as social
secretary with the Department of State-at the Embassy. It is believed that
this job has probably solved many of her financial problems and should also
inhibit her from exposing her past work with the Mexico City Station, as
such exposure could jeopardize her job. The Embassy in the Hague was
briefed in general terms on KDFACTOR-7's background.
C. KDFACTOR-1
KDFACTOR-1 is a Mexican citizen and the brother-in-law
of GERENDE. He was hired by the Station in 1956 to assist GERENDE in
processing the photographic take of the KDFACTOR Project (at that time
the LIPSTICK Project and later the LIEMPITY Project), KDFACTOR-1
SE

was later assisted in processing the photographic take by his wife,
LIEMPTY-5, who is GERENDE's sister. KDFACTOR-1 was terminated
in March 1971, and the photographic processing previously done by
KDFACTOR-1 is now done in the Station. The termination was amicable
and largely due to delays in film processing as KDFACTOR-1's medical
practice expanded. There does not appear to be any security problem
in the termination of KDFACTOR-1 as he is discreet and also a close
relative of GERENDE. The security of processing the film in KDFACTOR-1's
medical office was good as KDFACTOR-1's wife, LIEMPTY-5, was assist-
ing him with the processing and with the security of the darkroom.
D. LIEMPTY-5
LIEMPTY-5 was hired by the Station in 1957 to assist
KDFACTOR-1 with the processing of KDFACTOR films. She is the sister
of GERENDE and wife of KDFACTOR-1. She was terminated along with
KDFACTOR-1 in March 1971. Due to her close relationship with GERENDE
and KDFACTOR-1, she is not considered a threat to the Project Security.
E. Oliver G. SCANTLING
SCANTLING is a Mexican citizen who worked as a Station
agent from 1954 until his termination without prejudice in February 1971,
SCANTLING is in an excellent financial position and has assisted the
Station in recent years largely because his strong motivation to work
against the Communists. SCANTLING worked as a surveillance team
leader from 1954 to 1957 and then in the LIEMPTY (KDFACTOR) Project
from 1958 through 1966. He was the cut-out to LIEMPTY-6 and a back-up
principal agent for GERENDE. SCANTLING's termination was amicable,
and he is not considered a security problem to the Station or the KDFACTOR
Project.
F. LIEMPTY-6
LIEMPTY-6, a Mexican citizen and long-term Station
asset, was retired in May 1968. He had manned the LIMITED photo base-
house with his wife and son assisting him. He had been working with the
Station since 1954, but age and ill health had reduced his efficiency.
LIEMPTY-6 knows GERENDE and SCANTLING, but is not aware of the
names or locations of any of the present KDFACTOR agents and basehouses.
While he could give information on his participation in KDFACTOR activities
up to 1968, he has no motive to do this and is apparently happily retired on
his Agency termination bonus plus some financial assistance from his son-
in-law. He is not considered a threat to the security of this Project.
SECRET


SECRET
- 9 -
There was one indication that the Soviets were seeking
out the LIMITED photo basehouse and may have had suspicions concerning
LIEMPTY-6. This was a report by KADAGE-10 that in mid-1966 Stanislav
Sergevevich Slinkov (201-271103), a Soviet Embassy guard, asked KADAGE-
10 to report on his neighbors near the Soviet Embassy. Slinkov expressed
interest in all the occupants of the new apartment building which houses the
KADASINTHE photo basehouse, but did not mention the KDABSINTHE base-
house keepers by name. Slinkov did name specific persons he was inter-
ested in and these included LIEMPTY-6. KADAGE-10, of unknown
reliability, said he did not give Slinkov any information, but added that,
between himself and the Station, he suspected LIEMPTY-6 and had heard
it rumored he worked for the Americans. In 1966 Headquarters already
assumed the Soviets were aware of the LIMITED basehouse because it was
used for radio direction of the LIEMTRYP mobile surveillance. In any case,
the Soviets apparently took no action prior to the closing of the LIMITED
basehouse and the relocation of LIEMPTY-6 in May 1968. It is believed
to be known has no implications that would threaten the security of current
KDFACTOR assets.
5. Current KDFACTOR Security Practices:
The two photo basehouses, KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE
remain compartmented, as they have been throughout the history of the
Project. The Station case officer responsible for the project meets weekly
with KDFACTOR-2, responsible for the KDLITERAL basehouse, and with
KDFACTOR-5, responsible for the KDABSINTHE basehouse. In these
meetings he picks up the product, provides new supplies, pays salaries
and handles miscellaneous administrative matters. These are car meetings
usually held in early morning or at night and the pickup points are changed
by the KDFACTOR-2, and the project has been completed. The
scheduled whenever possible. The photographic product is processed in
the Station, thus increasing the security and timeliness of its handling
over the past practice of having KDFACTOR-1 process it in his office
darkroom. The case officer only meets with KDFACTOR-2 and KDFACTOR-5;
however, in emergencies other writing family members of either basehouse
can be contacted and met. In case the present sites or personnel are com-
promised, the Station has rented another apartment in the building housing
the KDBASINTHE basehouse and has installed members of the KDCALVERT
Project as residents. This new apartment offers as good a vantage point
SECRET


for photographic coverage as the KDABSINTHE and could quickly be
activated if for any reason the KDABSINTHE basehouse becomes
untenable.

PROJECT LUMPY
REQUEST FOR RENEWAL
1. CURRENT OBJECTIVES
A. The overall objective of Project LUMPY, now in its eleventh
year of existence, is to collect operational information on the
FIFTEAL installation, its personnel and visitors, as well as
related targets of opportunity through statlony mobile photo-
graphic and physical surveillance mechanisms. Corollany
will be supported by the Department of the LUMPY
installations, mehantons, and personnel are as follows:
1. To provide detailed operational information pertaining
to the daily movements and activities of FIFTEAL personnel,
particularly those individuals of intelligence interest,
as well as information on the FIFTEAL physical plant and
visitors to the premises.
2. To collect operational lntumation on persons asscciated
with FIFTEAL personnel and on individuals known or suspected
to have connections with the FIFTEAL intelligence services
and the possible problems which are fimical to the interests

L. The above cieintives are to be utilized through certain
maintance and enclimitation 11 the LIMIIC and HOMS base-
ing and the services of Ino-tim
contract agent, Raymond E. G.R.N. and the FIFTEAL system is the
cennrestone of the Station's expericinal program against the
BISTEL target and as such is completely responsible to priority A-1
of the Station's (openfing Directive).

Dart in the Trestert year Project IMMITY provided all of the
fixed operational photographs and physical surveillance reports
used in Mexico it's Station's operations targeted against the
EUSTHAL Installation and personnel. Specific examples 01 the
LEVENTY Project's progress and contributions will be found in
Section 3 below (FECTIVENESS).
2. CHANGES
A. Cipertional
1 The mail of chance during the preceding period has been
the closing of the LUMTID hasbouse and the termination of
LEVENTY. This has resulted in considerable financial
saving with the loss in efficiency-to the contrary, as a
matter of fact. The major reason for the change was the
fact that LEVENTY- was growing less reliable with age. He
was not always able to be on the job, and when he was, his
work, he was a very good job. He was a very moderate,
and his photoraphy was often poor. There had been
considerable overlap between LIMYRIC and LIMITED reporting,
and with the closing of LIMITED, the LIVRIC working hours
were 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 P P P P P P P

C. Personnel
1. As noted above, LEMPTY-3 was terminated effective
31 May 1968 in connection with the closing of the LIMITED
basehouse. Termination was completely amicable, and
LIMITY- received a generous termination bonus.
2. LEMPTY-26 was hired as of 1 May 19-8 to help LILYRIC
personnel maintain their expanded coverage. No security
factor is involved, as LIMITY-2 is part of the same family
as the rest of the LILYRIC personnel. LIMITY-2: had been
granted an AM in 1968 and had been used sporadically since
1968.
3. An amendment to GRENDE's contract has been requested,
This amendment would guarantee GRENDE termination benefits
equal to these provided for by Mexican law, in the event of
GRENDE's termination by WOPFRM. The amendment would also
provide GRENDE with a grandatud scale of benefits should
be decide to resign. See HUMIL-3 312, 27 January 19-8, for
details.
3. EFFECTIVENESS
Throughout the period under review, each operational component
of Project LEMPTY contributed actively and concretely to the
inillionent of the operational tasks levied on Station Excise
City. High-lights of the accomplishments and the achievements
of each component are cited below:
A. Blend Reschoolses
J. LIMITED
Until its termination, the LIMITED installation provided daily
photographic coverage and physical surveillance of the main
gate of the FESTEAL installation. During the seven-month
period from 1 November 1967 through 31 May 1968, the LIMITED
base provided 911 lermes of operational photographe. In
addition, the LIMITEE base provided over 1,000 pages of
physical surveillance reports.
2. LILYRIC
During the Project year under review, the LILYRIC installation
provided extensive photographic and fixed visua 1 surveillance
of the front of the FESTEAL installation. The LILYRIC base-
house provided the majority of the operational phototrophs
produced by the LIMITEE Project. During the 15-month period
from 1 November 1967 through 31 December 1968, the LILYRIC
basehouse provided 16,301 operntional photographs and several

thousand pages of physical surveillance reports covering the
daily movements of all FISTAL Officers. As a specific
people of the importance of ILLYRIC coverage, the ILLYRIC
approach of the National Institute of Health and Health of a KOLDY
citizeu who had been in clandestine contact with an AGRIP
officer. This information was turned over to LNERGO, which
was pursuing the case. In general, ILLYRIC provides the
Station with a Jarge percentage of the CI raw material
of the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. of the Science
numbers, PCS and TDY arrivals and departures, unusual
activities such as demonstrations, unusual or lengthy
absences of personnel, etc. This information also has
been made in the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. is as
possible to source on identification of FISTAL personnel and
of information on their movements. The Station has frequent
requests from LEMGO which can only lie fulfilled by LEMDY
coverage, and this "permanent and complete record" of FISTAL
activities is invaluable for servicing the CE requirements
of both VENTIL and LEMGO.
3. LICALLA
The U.S. and the U.S. whose cited l'empath period, the LICALLA installation
provided photocouple and physical surveillance coverage of
the back of the FISTAL installation and its garden and
patic area. This coverage provided 5,125 individual photographs
as well as numerous surveillance and observation reports.
These reports included daily, weekly, and monthly summaries
of activities, sent-monthly attendance records (of FESTAL
and FESTAL) and the FESTAL and FESTAL. The U.S. and
cereare of tareets selected by the Station. It should be
noted that the LICALLA basehuse allows Station (exice City
to serve the BAT it personnel der the for of

B. Sincerely of Fixed Pashouse Effectiveness
The used I.LENTY business (LITTE) LIALLA, and LILYRIC
provided approximately 21,267 individual rances of operational
photographs during the month period reviewed above. The S.
photographic coverage, line with the physical surveillance
reports prepared by each Basehouse, has proven to be a most
reliable and viable tool for:
Seles


1. Following the daily comings and signs of FISTAL
personnel and infiruous employees.
2. Confining the identities of FESTAL staffers and
their visitors (see of whom are ELLAY citizens).
3. Ascertaining and verilying the relative rank and
position as well as indicating the scetic intelligence
service concetica of various FESTAL officers.
4. Providing detailed reporting on the novement and habit
patterns of selected targets of special interest.
5. Providing physical inatilities for the support of
various operational, technical, and surveillance operations.
C. The Mobile Photo:raphic Unit
1. During the period under review, the LENTAL mobile
photographic unit covered 41 phototrahe assignments in
support of Mexico City Station's FESTAL, PERUINEN, and
Communist Party operations. An average of two to three days
in the year, the total of the total utility rotating the time
of day the coverage is provided. The FESTAP operators,
LEMTY-10 and -11, have consistently tested in a useful
and excellent quality photographic product.
2. In addition, while not on an assignment, both operators
have regularly assigned duties. LENTY-10 has the responsi-
bility for obtaining, renewing, and servicing most of the
Station's accommodation addresses. The addresses are
serviced three times a week. LENTY-11 has been serving
as a whole for the next year as the seventh member of the
LETTREAC. Surveillance team and has performed well in this
capacity.
D. Raymond H. GRENDE - LENTY Principal Agent
During the period under review, Raymond H. GRENDE continued in
his role as the Project LEMTY principal asset. GRENDE operates
as the full-time cut-out to the LENTY, LENTYIC, and LICALLA
bascheouses and bore the first echelon agent handling responsibility
for the related personnel. In addition, GRENDE continued to
be the most important part of the organization for the operator
of the LEMTY photographic developing/resources and
LEMTY-4. GRENDE's overall operational assignment involved
at least 10 clandestine meetings per week. in addition to his
meetings with the LEMTY Project case officer. It should also
be noted that GRENDE made numerous and essential contributions
to the 15th year of work. The operation and assisted the Station greatly
with his detailed knowledge in many instances. He is used
to make independent investigations and reincubation checks. He


as stated the Station in its MINIMAL program, As a part of the
Station's effort to broaden GRIND's herions and to like better
advantage of his capabilities, GRENDS was made the handling
officer for GREEN-3 under close case officer supervision.
Similar tasks are envisioned for GRENDS in the future--agent
handling as well as the spotting and assessment of operational
leads. These tasks are all assigned with due regard for
GRENDE's primary responsibilities, with the aim of getting the
optimum use out of a capable and experienced field contract
agent.
Overall Directiveness
In the field above, each individual operational component of the
17-HPMY project, with the exception of the phased-out LIMITED
basehouse, contributed regularly and significantly to the wilil-
ment of Station Mexico City's operational program. Based on the
continued excellent performance of Project personnel and the
overall contributions of this Project, the Station strongly
recommends that this Project be cent inued during the forthcoming
Project year as an essential element of the Station's operational
support apparatus.
4. PROBLEMS AND SECURITY
During the Project year under review there were no known incidents
which adversely affected the security of project LIXITY or the
related personnel. The termination of LIXIETY: caused no problems,
nor did the construction of a maid's room on the root of the LICALLA
installation, adjacent to LIXMITY-9's photo point. There is no
indication that FISTEAL personnel had any suspicions about the
safety of the General and the General and the General and the
vehicle (see MEXICO CITY 225, 25 February 19.70) caused momentary
concern because the vehicle had been bought from a dealer where
LIXMITY-9 has a part-time job. Along with all other employees
of the auto dealer, LIXETY: was questioned about the purchaser
of the car. Thical LIXITY-9 was worried because he knew the
safety of the General and the General and the General and happened,
the investigation was dropped and to cause close to the out any
adverse effect on LIXITY-9 or the TICALIN basehouse.
5. LIAISON AND INTER-AGENCY COORDINATION
Not applicable to Project LIXMITY.
6. PLANS
A. The changes made in the period under review have been largely
technical. will the exception of a continued expansion of


non-Limtry-oriented Operational activity by GRAND, there are
me significant operational chances contained. LIMPTY is
a project designed to support the National's PR-OTOP program and
is useful only as long as it supports the program effectively.
The Station believes that the support has been developed by
that the product of the operation is valuable. Cecassional minor
changes will undoubtedly be made in response to specific
requirements and to continual efforts toward improvement, but
continuing emphasis on the FESTAL target 10 the incresonble
future means, amount other things. that the LESTT trouct, in
cigarette industry's present form, will continue to be a necessary part
of the stritios present.
B. No need for expansion, in terms of personnel or facilities,
is foreseen, but costs will preabuic clue slowly but steadily
to permit salary increases and to keep up with the rising cost
of living as it affects utilities and supplies. Replacement of
the 100% of the total cost of the production of the previous
project utilize, as this has certainly written.
To cover the period and the number 10) amount the
line in FY 11, The current rete 10 is being written on 10
assumption that the whole sale is that repialed in 27 10
and that no further repiaement will be necessary in the fore-
scable futr.

C. As in the past, Fascond H. GENDRE will submit seni-monthly
accounting for all project expenditures with appropriate
receipts or certifications. Thore will be no requirements for
foreign currency beyond the Station's capability to provide.
S. SUGGENCY CONDITIONS
A. In the event of civil disorders or the evolution of complete
eniorced neutrality on the part of the host covernunt, it is
believed that regular operational contact could be maintained
with the majority of the active LEMITY agents via Raymond H.
GRINDG or in his absence, Oliver G. SCANTLING.
B. In the most unlikely event of the establishment of a regime
openly hostile to LIMEST, limited contact could probably be
maintained with the majority of the active Project agents.
However, under these circumstances, it is highly probable that
the activities of this project would be somewhat curtailed.
C. Revised and up-tated emergency contact plans for use with
Savond H. GENDR and Oliver G. SCANTLING are on title in the
Station and at headquarters (see
stos and HUMA-28282, dated 5 February 1966).

SUBJECT: Supplementary Appropriation for LIEMPTY
It is requested that the figures in the attached
field project renewal be amended and that an additional
$26,205 bc approved to cover the period 1 December 1968
through 30 June 1969 in order to carry the LIEMPTY Project
to the end of a fiscal year. This sum is identical to that
requested for a similar period in 1968 as there is no
present justification for projecting any change in the
financial requirements. The supplement would bring the
cost of LIEMPTY to a total of $69,725 for 19 months.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT
: LLIEMPTY Project Renewal
1. Renewal of Project LIEMPTY for the period 1 Decem-
ber 1967 through 30 November 1968 in the amount of $43,520
is hereby requested. $26,205 would be spent in FY 1968 and
$17,315 in FY 1969. The project was budgeted for $45,000 for
FY 1968; funds are available within the Division. Estimated
costs for the coming project year are a little less than the
amount programmed for the previous year and a little more
than what was actually disbursed.
2. LIEMPTY is designed to provide physical surveil-
lance to the government to a toxic City. It covers three
nearby properties (two in front of the Embassy's sole entrance
and one behind the garden) from which visual and photographic
surveillance are carried out by experienced personnel. The
project also covers a darkroom where a technician processes
and equipment is used to provide a new design and development
tion on a primary target, certain of the LIEMPTY personnel
are also available for miscellaneous support tasks, such as
servicing postal boxes, and running fixed and moving surveil-
lances. The photo truck which comes under the project is
used to provide a new design and development of the remote
embassies, and Latin American exiles. One of the baschouses
is also used as a radio dispatch point for the LIEMBRACE sur-
veillance team, but this function has been minimized during
the past year in an effort to prevent Soviet interception of
the signal.
3. a. The Mexican desk asked the appropriate opera-
tional component of SB Division for specific comment on the
value of LIEMPTY, and received the following:
'This rather unique operation has
unquestionably reduced the soli-
tion of the increasingly effective
Soviet Operations program of the
Mexico Station. On the positive
side its principal value lies. in the
identification of the Mexican and

third national contacts of the Soviets,
from which we must select and develop
the access agents so vital to our oper-
ations against the Soviet human target.
LIMePTY also provides us with a much
strongly strong, strong, and strong inter-
ships and activity patterns within the
Soviet mission itself, which in turn
facilitates effective targeting. The
society of the Soviet Union has been
a monitor of real and potential agent
contacts is of course obvious. It is
important to note that LIMePTY is not,
as might be the case in stations of
the Soviet Union. The main idea of
case of photography (or observation)
for the record. Rather it is an import-
ant facet of a concerted high priority
effort to get at and recruit individual
groups.
b. Station reporting has been in a similar vein.
Information produced is largely for operational purposes and
we often lack detail as to specific utility in a given situ-
ation, although we can produce statistics on numbers of photo-
graphs produced and numbers of pages of surveillance notes.
It is clear that the FBI is an interested customer and they
have received from LIMePTY a grant many reports on American
government and Soviet Embassy, and valuable support to double
agent operations.
The one of the way in a conversation on 8 December 1977, the
officer who has the station's SB section told the President
that LIMePTY is basic, and essential to all of the branch's
operational planning, and the U.S. military party material
first thing in the morning" and studies it for leads, evidence
of which Soviet officers have been in the Embassy and which
ones have been away, who has used which car, who has been talk-
ing on the basis of the issue of the U.S. military organization, etc.
New additions to the Embassy staff can be tabbed as KGB or
GRU by their associates, their activity patterns and the cars
they drive. (The I.S. men are often away from the Embassy,
while the legitimate FSO's tend to spend more time in their
offices. The KGB, GRU and regular diplomatic groups seldom
cross lines but stay within their own tight groups.) When

double agents are turned over from one case officer to a new
one, known to them only in alias, we are often able, through
surveillance and photographs, to establish the true identity
of the new case officer, as was done in the case of AEGIMMICK
in the spring of 1966.
4. In assessing the security of the operation, the
station assumes that the Soviets realize that they are being
watched, as was evidenced by a Soviet officer's trying to
shield an FBI-directed walk-in from observation. There have
been a series of new cases of the investigation of the
graphed, but no allegations that the Americans are doing it
have come to our attention; the probable assumption is that
the Mexicans are doing this. A former source who lives in
the neighborhood was asked on several occasions what he knew
as a fact that the above-mentioned FBI walk-in was not
have said they think he is watching them. On the security of
the LIGALLA safhouse there is a difference of opinion.
GERENDE, the outside case officer, thinks the Soviets are
not in the same way. The fact that the observation of the
disagrees and produces good justification for its views, cit-
ing the fact that the above-mentioned FBI walk-in was not
shielded when led into the back garden which LICALLA overlooks.
We have no evidence that Soviet interest is any threat to the
operation; rather it may be assumed that they accept the sur-
veillance as a fact of life.

PROJECT LIIEMPTY
REQUEST FOR RENEWAL
1. CURRENT OBJECTIVES
A. The overall objective of Project LIIEMPTY, now in its tenth
year of existence, is to collect operational information on the
FISTEL installation, its personnel and visitors, as well as
related targets of opportunity through stationary/mobile photo-
graphic and physicals, and to provide a new technology
objectives which to be fulfilled through us to the LIEMPITY
Institute, which mechanisms and personnel are as follows.
1. To provide detailed operational information pertaining
to the daily movements and activities of the FISTEL
personnel, particularly those individuals of intelligence
interest, as well as information on the FUSTEL physical
plant and visitors to the premises.
2. To collect operational information on persons associated
with FISTEL personnel and on individuals known or suspected
to have connections with the FISTEL intelligence services
or other hostile groups which are inimical to the interests
of the FISTEL.
3. To provide operational support, counter surveillance
and/or other protective services to WOFIRM personnel and
operations, as may be levied upon the Station or as may be
deemed necessary.
B. The above objectives are to be fulfilled through continued
maintenance and exploitation of the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA
basehouses, the LIENTRAP mobile unit, and the services of long-
time contract agent, Raymond H. GERENDE. These objectives are
in consonance with operational directives and Headquarters
requirements as received by Station Mexico City.
C. Throughout the Project year under review, Project LIEMPTY
continued to contribute directly and significantly to the fulfil-
ment of the Project. The project is to be required to requirements for
coverage of various targets faling within the above cited frame-
work. During the project year Project LIEMPTY provided nearly
all of the operational photographs and physical surveillance
reports used in Mexico City Stition's operations targeted against
the FISTEL installation and personnel. Specific examples of the
LEMPITY Project's progress and contributions will be found in
Section 3 below (EFFECTIVENESS).

2. CHANGES
A. Operational - Since the institution of the changes described
in the previous renewal request, it has not been found neces-
sary or desirable to make further major changes. The following
minor changes in operational technique have been made in an
effort to obtain continued improvement in the finished product:
1. LIEMPTY-9's proven effectiveness as an observer (see
paragraph 3 A (3) below) has enabled us to institute a
program of special,coverage on specific FISI. The level
of interest of the system is to be a potential time periods
of interest. The purpose is to permit the Station to gain
greater insights into. the activities and personal associations
of certain individuals, or in overall activities during a
certain time period. No change in LIEMPTY-9's overall
activities varies has been made; rather, flexibility has been
introduced.
2. Flexibility has also been introduced into the handling
of LIENTRAP, which is now working more closely with the
LIEMBRACE team in order to take greater advantage of targets
of opportunity. To this end, LIEMBRACE-1 has been placed
on a new strategy to develop a new strategy. Raymond H. GERENDE
of this responsibility and permitting Engineering devote time
to MHRAVEL activity (see sub-paragraph (3) below).
3. To September and October 1967 GERENDE was employed by
the Mexican MHRAVEL committee. This position gave him direct
access to FISTEAL and other delegations of interest, and
supplemented the Station's MHRAVEL program. It is expected
that GERENDE will obtain MHRAVEL employment again in 1968.
B. Financial - LIEMPTY-4 and -ll were granted salary increases
effective 1 July 1967. Memoranda of Oral Commitment were for-
warded to Headquarters in HRAA-32584 and HRAA-32585, 20 July
1967. There was no change in the salaries of the remaining
LIEMPTY agents.
C. Personnel - None.
3. EFFECTIVENESS
Throughout the period under review, each operational component
of Project LIEMPTY contributed actively and concretely to the
fulfillment of the operational tasks levied on Station Mexico
City. High-lights of the accomplishments and the achievements
of each component are cited below:


- 3 -
A. Fixed Basehouses
1. LIMITED
Throughout the past project year the LIMITED installations
provided daily photographic coverage and physical surveil-
lance of the main pate of the FJSTEAL installation. In
addition, the LIMITED base provided for a fixed radio
dispatching station which was used to support the LEMBRACE
surveillance team. Due to the stringent security measures
of the proposed design, the LIMITED base provided for a fixed
lation by local security forces, normal stake-outs by this
uSilateral team are precluded. However, with the radio
dispatching support from the LIMITED radio base, which
allows the LIEMBRACE team to work from adjacent safe areas,
including the United States and the United States. The added.
During the 12-month period from 1 November 1966 through
31 October 1967, the LIMITED base provided 1,834 frames of
operational photographs. in addition, the LIMITED base
provided over 2,500 pages of physical surveillance reports.
2. LILYRIC
During the project year under review, the LILYRIC installation
provided extensive photographic and fixed visual surveillance
of the front of the FJSTEAL installation. The LILYRIC base
provided the majority of the operational photographs produced
by the United States and during the 12-month period cited
in the LIMITED section above. The LILYRIC base provided
12,137 operational photographs and several thousand pages
of physical surveillance reports covering the daily move-
ments of all FJSTEAL officers.
3. LICALLA
During the above cited 12-month period, the LICALLA instal-
lation provided photographic and physical surveillance
coverage of the back of the FJSTEAL installation and its
garden and patio area. This coverage provided 4,917 indi-
vidual photographs as well as numerous surveillance and
reliance. The LILYRIC base provided the 12-month period
base allows Station Mexico City to observe the FJSTEAL
personnel during their off-duty and recreational hours.
The LICALLA installation has become the most valuable of the
LILYRIC base. The LILYRIC base provided the 12-month
because of the percepiveness of LIEMBTY-9. Hits surveil-
lance reports have frequenily given us valuable insight
into personal associations among the FJSTEAL personnel and
have enabled us to introduce greater flexibility and
effectiveness into the entire LIEMBTY operation.

B. Summary of Fixed Baschouse Effectiveness
The fixed LIFEMTY basehouses (LIMITED, LICALLA and LILYRIC)
provided approximately 18,888 individual frames of oper-
ational photographs during the 12-month period of the past
project year. This photographic coverage, linked with the
physical surveillance reports prepared by each basehouse,
has proven to be a most reliable and viable tool for:
1. Following the daily comings and goings of
FJSTEL personnel and indigenous employees.
2. Confirming the identities of FJSTEL staffers
and their visitors (zone of whom are WOLADY citizens).
3. Ascertaining and verifying the relative rank and
position as well as indicating the specific intelligence
service connection of various FJSTELA officers.
4. Providing detailed reporting on the movement and
habit patterns of selected targets of special interest.
5. Providing physical facilities for the support of
various operational, technical and surveillance
operations.
C. The Mobile Photographic Unit
1. Throughout the period under review, the LIENTRAP mobile
photographic support unit was regularly exploited and used
by Station Mexico City, not only on the FJSTEL target, but
also for PRUMEN and Comunicist Party operations as well as
the JMTIGER program. Over 2,000 operational photographs were
provided. In addition, the LIENTRAP personnel and unit
was used regularly to service and obtain various postal
accomodation boxes used by Mexico City, Headquarters and
other field stations.
D. Raymond H. GERENDE - LIFEMTY Principal Agent
During the period under review, with the exception of short
vacation periods, Raymond H. GERENDE, continued in his role
as the Project LIENTAPY principal agent. GERENDE operated
as the full-time cut-out to the LIENTPY, LILYRIC and LICALLA
basehouses and bore the first echelon agent handling respon-
sibility for the related personnel. In addition, GERENDE


- 5 -
continued to bear the contact and handling responsibilities
of the LIENTRAP unit (until mid-August 1967 - see paragraph
2 A (2) above) and for the operator of the LIEMPTY photo-
markings of the LIENTRAP unit (until mid-August 1967).
GERENDE's overall operational assignment involved at least
12 clandestine meetings per week, in addition to his
meetings with the LIEMPTY Project case officer. It should
also be noted that GERENDE made numerous and essential
requirements to the RI/NG and the RI/NG and the RI/NG listed
the Station greatly with his detailed area knowledge in
many instances. He is frequently used to make independent
investigations and neighborhood checks. As noted above,
he contributed significantly to the Station's MTRAVEL
program. Finally, he approached, developed and eventually
attempted to recruit an agent for use in PRURUNEN operations.
E. Overall Effectiveness
As outlined above, each individual operational component
of the LIENTAPT Project contributed regularly and significantly
to the fulfillment of Station Mexico City's operational
management. He also noted that the RI/NG and the RI/NG and
overall contributions of this project, the Station strongly
recommends that this project be continued during the forth-
coming project year as an essential element of the Station's
operational support apparatus.
4. PROBLEMS AND SECURITY
During the project year under review there were no known inci-
dents which adversely affected the security of Project LIEMPTY
or the related personnel.
5. LIAISON AND INTER-AGENCY COORDINATION
Not applicable to Project LIEMPTY.
6. PLANS
As noted above, the technical and operational changes
are in the past year have been effective and have resulted
in a product which is as closely geared to operational
requirements as possible. While major changes are
contemplated, every effort will be made to continue to
improve the product, including greater use of GERENDE as
an independent investigative asset, and as a spotter and
assessor of selected agent candidates. Such utilization
of GERENDE will be kept compartmented from other personnel
of the LIENTARP project and will normally be handled by
GERENDE in operational alias.


B. The LIENTRAP vehicle has been replaced, and no major
changes in personnel or material are contemplated. Salarios
of LIEMTY-personnel will be reviewed, and it is foreseen that
the rising cost of living will compel us to recommend salary
increases for certain of the agents who have not received
raises in some time.
7. COSTS
A. Past Project Year - Project LIEMTY was previously approved
for the period 1 December 1966 through 30 November 1967 for the
amount of 45,000 U.S. currency. Station records indicate that
the cost of these goods is 100 million. The cost of
the field. It is estimated that a total of 40,130 will be expended
in the entire project year. Bi-weekly accountings with pertinent
receipts and/or certifications were submitted by Raymond H. GERENDD
and the Project Project. The cost of the cost of the cost of all
LIEMTY Project expenditures made in the field. It is estimated
that approximately 5 hours of case officer and 10 hours of analyst
time is required each week to fulfill the operational, administrative
and analytical requirements of this project. (This figure does not
include the 40 hour-week put in regularly by Raymond H. GERENDD).
The cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of this Project
approved in the amount of 43,520 U.S. currency is 100 million. PERIOD be
December 1967 through 30 November 1968 (this figure represents a
slight decrease from the amount programmed for the previous project
year). While no large expenditures are anticipated for the replace-
ment of photographic equipment during the forthcoming period, an
increase in cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of
as well as the above-cited expectation of salary increases. Of the
amount requested above, 26,205 dollars should be allowed for fiscal
year 1968 and 17,015 dollars for fiscal year 1969. A detailed break-
down of the project expenditure by category and by fiscal year follows:

8. EMERGENCY CONDITIONS
A. In the event of civil disorders or the evolution of complete
enforced neutrality on the part of the host government, it is
now believed that regular operational contact could be maintained
with the majority of the active LIMPUTY agents via Raymond H.
GERENDE or in his absence, Oliver G. SCANTLING.
B. In the most unlikely event of the establishment of a regime
openly hostile to LIFORT, limited contact could probably be
reached with the majority of the active project agents.
However under the circumstances described above, it is highly
probable that the activities of this project would be somewhat
curtailed.

16 LIEMPTY Project Renewal
ACTION REGUIRO REFERENCES
Reference: HOMA-30403
1. The LIEMPTY Project was renewed on 13 January
1967 for the period 1 December 1966 through 30 November
1967 for a total of $45,000. Of this, $29,020 is for
FY 1967 and $15,980 is for FY 1968.
2. At the Station's convenience, Headquarters
would appreciate receiving a sketch showing the exact
position of the LILYRIC and LIMITED Baschouses in
relation to the target building. We would also like
to have a description of LILYOUSINE's new building--
how many floors, how many apartments on each floor, who
occupies the other apartments for buildings), and exactly
where the LILYRIC base is in the building.
3. You are requested to continue reporting any
unusual interest displayed by the target in the LIEMPTY
Baschouses.

1. CURRENT
A. The overall objective of Project LIMNETY, now in its ninth year of ex-
istence, is to collect operational information on the LEMUCK installation,
its personnel and visitors, as vell as related targets of opportunity
through staticery/able photographic and physical surveillance sechanises.
Chollary objectives which are to be fulfilled through use of the LIMERTY
installations, mechanical and mechanical design.
The proposed model operational information pertaining to the
daily arescente and activities of the LEMUCK personnel, particularly
those individuals of intelligence interest, as vell as information
on the LEMUCK physical plant and visitors to the preases.
2: To collect operational information on persons associated with
LIMERTXIC personnel and on individuals know or asseccied to have
connectica with the LEMICK intelligence services or other hostile
groups vithc are ininical to the interests of LEMUCK.
3. To provide operational support, counter surveillance and/or other
protective services to WORACT personnel and operations, as may be
levied upon the Station or as may be deemed necessary.
B. The above objectives are to be fulfilled through centined a台ntenance
and exploitation of the LIMTEC, LIMILIC and LICALIA baschouses, the
LETTARPA sable unit, and the services of long-time contract agent,
Raymond H. GESENDS. These objectives are in consonance with and represent
partial Fulfillment of the following sections of the current Related
Mission Directive (RMD) as approved for Station Mexico City:
PLIMITY A
Section 1, subsection c
Section 2, subsections b & e
PITARY B
Section 1, subsection c
Section 2, subsection a
Section 1, subsection a
c. Throughout the first year under review, Project LIMETY continued to
contribute directly and significantly to the ulfillment of Station and
fesiquarters' requests and requirecits for coverage of various targets
falling within the Framework of the above cited sections of the RMD.
During the last 10 months Project LIMETY provided the vast adjority of the
operational postotographs (approximately 16,000) and physical surveillance
reports (4,000) used in Mexico City Station's operations targettled against


-2-
the LDERICK installation and percnnel. Specific examples of the LIMITEY
Project's progress and contributions to the RND will be found in Section 3
below (EFFECTIVENESS).
2. CRANGES.
A. Operational - As noted in the previous Request for Project Renewal,
the former LIMITEO property was sold to LIMCUSING, who as per foroal agree-
ment with the Station, desolished the oil structure and consructed a new
edifice. While it was initially contepisted to place the LIMITEO
(LIMITEY3 -0 and -7) personnel in the new building and to retain the same,
equal division of woriced between LIMITEO and LIMITEO, 11 was later
excluded to save the present LIMITEO inchozine personnel (LIMITEO-13, -14,
-26 and -87) into the new base instead, along with the following ancillary
sociation.
An increase in the hours of both the photographic and physical surveillance
coverage provided from the new base by the LILMITEO operators (Coco-1600
hours) during the weekiays and to have the LIMITEO base provide
photographic and physical surveillance coverage from 1600-1850 hours
on weekdays and from 0500-1500 hours on weekends. These changes were
dictated by the LIMITEO program.
1. The new LIMITEO building offers a much better vantage point
of the photographic and physical surveillance train does the
present complex which houen the LIMITEO and LIMITEO bases.
Therefore, the Station felt that the personnel occupying this
new base should be those pozencing the highest technical skills
and also those able to provide the sest thorough and complete
coverage. Since the LIMITEO base now has only one trained
operator while the LIMITEO beachouse has these, the LIMITEO group
was a major part of the LIMITEO base.
2. Because it was apparent that the coverage of the LIMITEO
Installation would be a long-range and continuing requirement,
the Station desired to staff the new base with personnel of long-
range potential. LIMITEO-6, now almost 60 years old, does not
possess this potential; however, the LILMITEO agent complex
happily continues experienced personnel with youthful agents.
3. Finally, the social and financial status of the LILITEO
personnel is much sore compatible and consistent with the en-
vironment of the new building than is that of the LIMITEO fealty.
The above-cited revised work schedule was initiated in July 1966 and
the actual covesent of the LILITEO into the new base began in late
September 1968.

3. Financial - After a Ltrilled review of the then-existing LINGTY agent
salary structure, selected agents (LESPITA -6, -9, -16, and -11) were
cranted salary increases effective 1 January 1966. Forcal notification
and revised research 1001 constituent were forwarded to Headquarters
with BMA-09,155, listed 28 January 1966. There was no chance in the salaries
of the 8 reseining LIMSTY agents.
G. Forconnel
1. During the Project year under review, LIMSTY-6, -9, -15, -14, -26 and
-27 were afforded their initial 5035HUL examinations, all with satisfactory
results.
2. LIMSTY-26 was sumbered an 0A effective 29 November 1965 for use as
a cut-out to the LIMSTY because (1935-14177, dated 9 December 1965).
LIMSTY-26 has been actively used during the past Project year for the
above-stated purpose.
3. LIMSTY-27 was started an 0A on 27 July 1966 for use as a part-tise
LIMSTYL06 absolute overation (1967-1477), dated 1 August 1966). While
LIMSTY-27's heavy university schedule has thus far precluded his regular
use by the Station, is an anticipated that subject will be regularly
employed after the call of the present school term.
3. PROFITIVITIES
Throughout the period under review, each operational cosponent of Project
LIMSTY contributei aitively and concretely to the fulfillment of the
operational tasks related on Station Mexico City by the RUD and other
directives. High-Lights of the accomplishments and the achievements of
each component are cited below:
A. Fixed Reschcess
1. LIMITED
Throughout the past Project year (with the change in working hours
noted in paragement above), the LIMSTY installation project daily
photographic coverage and physical surveillance of the main gate of
the LEMSTOK installation. In addition, the LIMSTOK base provided
for a fixed ratio lisgetbining station which was used continually to
support the LIMSTORY surveillance team. Dete the project was
established in the following: the Project for the existing voting of the LIMSTICK
installation by local security forces, norval stake-outs by this
unilateral team are precluded. However, with the radio dispatching
support from the LIMSTOR radio base, which allows the LIMSTORAGE team to
work from adjacent safe areas, secure surveillance coverage of this

tanget can be provided. During the 9-month period from 1 November
1965 throust 50 July 1966, the LADITED base provided 1,775 traves
of operational photographs. In addition, the LADIED base provided
over 1,000 pages of physical surveillance reports.
2. LILYIC
During the Project year under review, the LILYIC installation
provided extensive photographic and fireil visual surveillance of the
front of the LADIDK installation. The LILYIC base act only pre-
vided the a'ority of the operational photographs produced by the LIMMITT
project, but also provided the aost detallied physical surveillance
reports. Darin; the 9-month period cited in the LIDITED section above,
the LILYIC base provided over 6,500 operational photographs and 3,000
pages of physical surveillance reports covering the indily movements of
all LADIDK actions.
3. LICANIA
During the above cited 9-month period, the LILYICA installation provided
photographic and physical surveillance coverage of the back of the
LIDENICK installation and its garden and petio area. This coverage
provided over 3,500 individual photographe as well as numerous sur-
vival and a 1000000000 reports. It should be noted that the
LICANA base allows storage and storage of the Reserve the LIDENIX
Larsonnel during their off-during period. Overall Hours.
B. Susser of Fixed Resehance Effectiveness
The fixed LIDENIX brachouses (LIDITED, LIDILA and LILYIC) provide
approximately 17,000 individual frames of operational photographs
during the first 9-month period of the past project year. Within the
last year, this photographic coverage linkei with the physical
surveillance reports prepared by each baschouse, has proven to be a
aost reliable and viable tool for:
1. Following the elly coeings and gings of LIDENIX personnel
and illnesses employees.
2. Confining the identities of LIDENIX stafers and their
visitors (some of whom are WOLADY citizens).
3. According an verifying the relative rank and position
as well as indicating the specific intelligence service connection
of various LIDENIXG officers.
4. Providing detailed reporting on the aoveent and habit patterns
of seleratic targets of special interest.
5. Providing physical facilities for the support of various op-
retional, secunical and surveillance cportions.

c. The Mebile Photographic Units
1. Throughout the period under review, the LIZINHAP Mebile photographic/
support unit was regularly axploital and used by Station Mexico City.
This unit provided over 1,600 individual photographs and was used in
nupport of Station operations and activities. or particular value to
Station Mexico City and the JUNIOR program were numerous photographs
of local and exile Coaunstst leaders provided by LIZINHAP. In addition,
the LIZINHAP personnel and unit was used regularly to service and
obtain various postal occasionation boxes used by Mexico City, Head-
quarters and other field stations.
D. Raymond T. OATKIDZ - LIZINHAP Principal Agent.
During the period under review, with the exception of short vacation
periods, Raymond T. GRIUMD, continued in his role as the Project
LIZINHAP principal agent. GRIUMD operated as the full-time out-at
the time of the program. The Project was completed by the Project
schelom agent handling responsibility for the related personnel. In
addition, GRIUMD continued to bear the contact and handling ren-
sponsibilition of the LIZINHAP unit and for the operator of the LIZIMTY
Project. The Project was completed by the Project. The Project
overall operational assignment involved at least 10 clainsetine meetings
per week, in addition to his meetings with the LIZIMTY Project case
officer. It should also be noted that GRIUMD made numerous and cencen-
tial contributions to the sensitive AMBD operation and enacted the
Station recently with his detailed area knowledge in many instances.
E. Cverell Effectiveness
As outlined above, each individual operational component of the LIZIMTY
Project contributed regularly and significantly to the fulfillment of
Station Mexico City's operational projure. Panel on the continued
excellent performance and overall contributions of this project, the
Station strongly vacasancies that this project be continued during the
study. The project your an essential element of the Selections
operational support apparatus.
4. PRONING AND SIZING
During the Project year under review these were no known incidents which
adversely affect the security of Project LIZIMTY or the related personnel.
The only significant probles encountered in the operation and administration
of this project steasel from the physical move of the LIZINHAP personnel to
the new base in the LIZINHAP building. Miserous delays arising from the
faulty performance of the local contractor and construction crews heapered
a timely relocation of this base. However, it is anticipated that the new
LLIMHO base will be in full operation by the end of October 1966.

Net applicable to Project LIXITY.
6. PLANS.
A. As outlined in paragraph 6 of the Station's previous request for the
renewal of Project LIXITY, a program was undertaken to requely an alserinie
the LIXIFITY phototrophic processing base. During the past year, a signi-
icant portion of the equipment used in the developing and processing
Inbomatory was replaced. As a result of this progrine, negatives and
photogromphic prints of aach higher quality are now being preduced.
Consequently, only alner changes in the operation of the phototrophic
laboratory and its equivalent are contogualized for the enausing period.
2. The present pharical condition, alluege and frequent use of the
LIXITIAP unit detentes the inanimate reglacement of this unit. Cation
of a quality has received Subjuctures approval for the replacement of this
vehicle.
C. Other then noted above, Keduo City plans no significant operation,
alidinitiative or personnel changes, since it is generally lit that this
Project 18 our operating at its optima size and in a highly satisfactory
manner. After 1 January 1967, the Station will review the existing LIXITI
perpornel alwary schedule and consider possible reion, main in a selective
basis or specifically bevel to the writing cont of LIXIIV.
7. Operations
Best Project Year - Project LIXITI are provionally approvei for the
period 1 rebarage 1965 through 50 Resebran 1966 for the amount of 4,170
U.S. currency; British records indicate that thus far, Project LIXITY
has expeated 150011 in the field. It is esttvelat that approximately
1,500 dollars has been expealed by Handquarters, principally in the
acquisition of new equipment for the LIXETY phototropulic inboratory.
The following information is the following: (1) the Project LIXITY
submitted by Reenel v. 120000 to the Citation finance officer v1n the
Project case office for all LIXIIV Project expenditures aise in the field.

MANGENCY CONDITIONS.
A. In the event of civil discortiers or the evolution of complete or
enforced neutrality on the part of the host government, it is now believed
that regular operational contact could be maintained with the majority of

B. In the most untituly event of the establishment of a regime openly
hostile to LEMPIY, liable contact could probably be maintained with the
majority of the active Project agents. Rovervay, under the circunastnenc
described above, it is highly probable that the activities of this Project
vould be somewhat curtailed.
c. Revised and up-dated serreency contact plans for use with Rayamol N.
EXHANCED and Oliver G. SANTLING are on file in the Station and at
Headquarters (see HMM-26355, dated C1 February 1966 and 1804-24252,

LEMPITY Project Renewal
NCTION REQUIRE DURFUMERS
Reference: HEMA 24650
1. The LILEMITY Project Renewal request forwarded in
reference, was approved on 29 January 1965 for the period
1 December 1964 through 30 November 1965 for a total of
$45,300; $27,675 for FY 1965 and $17,625 for FY 1966.
2. At the time of approval, Assistant KUDOVE stated
he expects this project to live within the sum authorized
for the year, and that there will be no amendment for
additional purposes.
1. You were informed in HMMW 13282 in the dispatch
on the LIEHBRACE Project Renewal, KUTUBE is interested in
the problem of hostile monitoring of any radio communications
from LIMITED. You should remain alert to this problem, and
inform us if Headquarters can be of any assistance in helping
you maintain communications security.
4. You are reminded that the LIEMITY Project, as approved,
only covers the salary for Oliver G. SCANTLING through 31 May
1965. It is suggested that a separate project be written to
cover SCANTLING if his new duties do not fall entirely under
any other approved project.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, EXO
SUBJECT
Reneval of this project is recommended. This
operation continues to carry out the same type of
activity it has engaged in for a number of years
and its product continues to be important to our
efforts against the Soviets and Communist Party in
Mexico. The Station should carefully select the
new operational assignment of Oliver G. SCANTLLING
so as to make post use of this long-time asset's
considerable clandestine experience.

Review of Project LIEMPTY
(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)
I.
CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION
A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives) :
1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities, " SCANTLING has continued (See the
last two Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA-14093,
13 November 1959, and HMMA-15979, 18 November 1960) to provide
worthwhile information pertaining to this objective.
a. During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be
used to follow up leads produced by LIENVOY. For example,
operational Information recently indicated that the LIMERICK
target was using the services of a Mexico City firm to repair
safes. Through discreet investigation SCANTLING was able to
identify the firm, its location and the name of the owner in the
event that we later wished to make an approach to him or to
exploit this information in another manner.
b. SCANTLING is still the Statlon's primary source for
keeping current records on the residences of the many LIMERICK
personnel in Mexico City. This is accomplished in several ways;
the most important being SCANTLING's follow up of all LIENVOY
leads which indicate the LIMERICK people are interested in
renting a given piece of property. (See previous project renewal
request for additional details).
2. "To collect operational information pertaining to other targets
of opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence
interest operating in Mexico." SCANTLING is very useful for collecting
information on other Station targets:
SECRET/LEBOK
CS 002
51-1-11


14/0000
SECRET
-2-
a. On the basis of a request to the Station from the
ODACID Chief, SCANTLING was sent to Puebla to be an
eyewitness to the 4 June 1961 Catholic inspired anti-CASTRO
demonstrations. Not only did SCANTLING obtain the desired
information, and samples of many of the leaflets used, but he
prepared his report for the Station in time for the COS to give
the ODACID Chief a briefing at 1000 hrs., 5 June 1961.
SCANTLING does an excellent Job on this type of assignment
due principally to his ability to observe and report objectively.
b. SCANTLING was instrumental in establishing that
Fernando LLANES Cavero and his wife were living at a local
Mexico City address. This case has been of considerable
counterespionage interest to Headquarters.
c. SCANTLING has continued his contributions to the
Paul Frederick KIRSCHIIOFF case by periodic interviews with
the subject's neighbors and associates.
3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitment, debriefings,
and surveillances." SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both
directly and indirectly as will be noted by the examples listed below :
a. SCANTLING devoted a lot of time to the
surveillance and attempted recruitment of Abcl ARTEAGA, a
Mexican national employed at the Cuban Embassy. SCANTLING
talked with ARTEAGA several times and undoubtedly was
primarily responsible for the later success of the recruitment
made by another Station agent.
b. Some additional time was devoted to the Cesar
CONZALEZ Sanchez case in February 1961 when SCANTLING
determined that CONZALEZ was still in Mexico City. See
the last renewal for additional details on this case.
c. In connection with the above objective SCANTLING
has performed numerous pretext and neighborhood Investigations
for the Station. SCANTLING also does most of the local
investigations requested by ODACID and other ODVOKE
components.
SECRET/K


14/0000

-3-
d. SCANTLING spent six weeks during July and
August of this year giving tradecraft and surveillance
training to LI'PAILS 5 and 7 from Monterrey. Although
this is not a direct contribution to the above objective, it
is considered sufficiently related to mention here.
4. In addition to his contributions to the above objectives,
SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the
Station. For example, SCANTLING is now handling LIEMBROIL-2 and
will continue to do so until the return of LIMOTOR-14 in June 1962. Also,
during the past project year, SCANTLING handled the LIRICE surveillance
team until July 1961 whou Simon D. CLACKETT (ps) returned to Mexico
City. SCANTLING is also used to spot and rent safe houses and apartments
for other Staton operations.
5. As stated in the preceding Requests for Project Renewal,
although SCANTLING's LIMEMT.Y Project objectives can never be completely
fulfilled. It is the Staton's opinion that SCANTLING has made important and
valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to
other Station activities in general. SCANTLING's production, measured
against monetary expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors,
unquestonably justifies his continuation as an integral part of Project
LIEMPTY.
B. Raymond H. GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):
1. "To collect operational Information pertain ing to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities through use of photographic base houses, "
Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute
to this objective. To avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual
description of the functions of these three bases and how they contribute
to the above objective. There has been no change in the coverage as
described in the 1960 Request for Project Renewal.
2. "To collect operational Information and Identify operational
leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." The LIENTRAP
operation, handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this
SECRET


140000
SECRET/K
-4-
objective. In addition to performing numerous photographic assignments
in support of other Station operations, LIENTRAP devoted nearly four
months, on a fulltime basis, to coverage of the LIERODE operation. For
several weeks the entire "take" from the LIERODE target was recorded
from the LIENTRAP vehicle. Later, the LIENTRAP agents operated the
LIERODE technical gear from the initial LIERODE stationary base.
3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e.,
rent hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillance,"
GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other
Station operations and activities. GERENDE's comprehensive area
knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make him an
extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities. GERENDE
also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many
Station operations requiring them.
4. The quality and quantity of operational information produced
by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE's control
and supervision is considered worthwhile. The Station concludes, therefore,
that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project should be continued.
C. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:
As stated in the previous project renewal, it can readily be noted
that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and
in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherescance of the
Related Mission Directive. The project has not produced any positive
intelligence nor has it been intended that it should do so. The project's sole
purpose is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational
information in support of other Station operations.
II.
CHANGES
There have been no changes in the LIEMPTY Project during the past project
year except that SCANTLING relinquished control of the LIRICE (formerly LIJERSEY)
surveillance team in July 1961 in accordance with previous plans.

III.
EFFECTIVENESS
There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter the
validity of the remarks made in Section III of last year's project renewal request.
IV.
PROBLEMS
The security problem in connection with the LICALLA operation, which
was described in last year's renewal request, is still present but has not caused
any known difficulty. At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW-9736, the LICALLA
base was reactivated on 29 May 1961. The base operator has been cautioned to be
ever alert for any unusual incidents which might indicate that the base has been
compromised. This is the only problem experienced by the LIEMPTY Project
during the past project year.
V.
PLANS
The Station considers that the project is now operating at its optimum size
and does not plan to expand it during the coming year. Rather, efforts will be
devoted to refining and better utilizing the existing project organizational
arrangements.
VI.
COSTS
A. Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project LIEMPTY
expended-$21,458.00 during Fiscal Year 1961 (1 December 1960 - 30 June 1961) and
has thus far during Fiscal Year 1962 (through 30 September 1961) expended about
$11,000.00. It is anticipated that about $8,000.00 will be expended during the last
two months (October and November 1961) of the project year. This will make a
total expenditure during the project year of about $40,500.00, or some $12,500.00
under the budget estimate of $53,000.00.
B. Ensuing Period - Of the total $49,500.00 budget, itemized below,
$29,500.00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year 1962 and the
balance, $20,000.00 should be expended during Fiscal Year 1963. Normal accounting
procedures will be used for all expenditures.

REVIEW OF PROJECT LIFETY
(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)
I. CURFEXT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION
A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation
to project objectives):
1. "To collect operational information per-
taining to LIMERICK personnel and physical
facilities." SCANTLING has continued (See the
last Project Review forwarded as an attachment
to HEMA-14093, 13 November 1959) to provide
worthwhile and significant information per-
taining to the above project development follow
a few examples.
1. PRODUCTION (SCANTLING's production)
to controlled casing of the LIMERICK
electrical power supply was forwarded
to Headquarters as an attachment to
HEMA-14496, 12 February 1960. The pro-
duction of the LIMERICK system was
established in which takes several weeks
to compile accurately, illustrates the
unusual talenta possessed by SCANTLING
together with his valuable contributions
to the Station's operational information
collection.
2. COMING has been used frequently
to follow up leads produced by LIMERDY
LIMESKICK (now produced by LIMESKY). For
example, in May 1960, LIFET indicated
that the LIMERICK target was having con-
siderable contact with an AGENCIA ROBLES
and the LIMESKICK system. The LIMESK
outgoing shipments. By discreet investi-
gation, SCANTLING was able to provide the
Station with additional pertinent information
and information on the LIMESKICK system. These
engaged in by the firm. Such information
then becomes readily available for exploitation
should a LIMERICK shipment of particular
interest come to the attention of the Station.
c. SCANTLING is the Station's primary
investigative asset for keeping track of
the LIMESKICK system. The loss of LIMENICK
personnel. The Station consists of important
from the counterespionage standpoint to main-
tain information on the contract all

LIMENICK residences. In addition, specific
targeto are continually considered for LICOOL
installations. A recent example of SCATLING's
society, the "society" is a "society" that
ting and acquisition of the LIMOTCR base in
the same apartment building with LITALON -1.
Contributions of this type operational informa-
tion are quite time consuming due to the
necessity for checking out several apartments
that a LIMOTCR individual may initially be
used to the city.
2. "To collect operational information pertaining to
other targets of opportunity, foreign official installa-
tions and personnel of intelligence interest operating
in Mexico. As indicated below, SCANLING is also
extremely useful for collecting information on targets
other than LIMOTCR.
3. "The proposed SCANLING was instrumental
in locating property adjacent to the LITABBY
installation which the Station has since
rented in anticipation of initiating photo-
graphic and technical operations. SCANTLING
was able to accomplish this assignment only
after a thorough casing and pretext investi-
gations of the several pieces of property
and equipment. The proposed SCANLING
b. SCANLING is also used to follow up
sensitive leads in connection with LIFEA
and LIEVOY production from LITABBY and
sister targets (See example as to type
under I,Al, b and e above).
c. SCANLING was used as an investigative
asset to determine the local address and
exact employment of Gordon William CHOTES
(201-220025), a counterespionage case of
the interest to headquarters and ODENY.
3. "The generalized national leads through recruitments
debriefinge, and surveillance." As examples of
SCANLING's contributions this objective, the
following cases are listed:
a. SCANLING devoted a considerable amount
of time to his attempts to locate Cesar
GOI'ZALEZ Sanchez, a known agent of a Com-
munist Country. He followed various leads
on GOI'ZALEZ from March to August 1960 before
/


14/00/00
-3-
GONZALEZ was finally identified and his
Mexico City home a.d business addressee were
ascertained. See HJVA-15626, 9 September 1960,
for further details.
The U.S. Treasury investigative work on a
NUSDA case of priority interest was conducted
by SCANTLING. During this investigation it
was necessary for SCANTLING to travel to
Aquascal lentes, Guanzjuato and Kinatitan to
obtain the information required by Headquarters.
See the attachments to University of
New York, 1971-116, 20 May 1960,
4. In addition to his contributions to the above objec-
tives, SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support
requirements of the Station. For example, SCANTLING
handled several of Raymond H. GESKLEVE's (ps) operations
and the following: (1) the U.S. Treasury Administration
and September 1960. Also, SCANTLING has been managing
the LIDENESY surveillance team since the departure of
Simon D. CLACKETT in August 1960. It is hoped that
SCANTLING can be relieved of this assignment as soon
as the LIDENPO project is approved. SCANTLING has also
been based to aport and rent price houses for various
stations operations, a Valuable operational service
service.
The U.S. Treasury Administration project
hereval, a though SCANTLING's LIDENITY project objectives
can never be completely fulfilled, it is the Station's
opinion that SCANTLING has made important and valuable
contributions to LIDENETY Project objectives specifically
and to other Station activities in general. SCANTLING's
production, measured against monetary expenditures,
case officer time and other intangible factors, unique-
and competitive activities, this continuation as an integral part
of Project LIDENETY.
B. Raymond H. GERNEDE Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):
1. "To collect operational information pertaining to
LIMTRICK personnel and physical facilities through use
of photographic base houses." Together w.th their
extensive photographic coverage of the LIMERICK target,
the photographic bases also contribute other types of
operational information:
a. LIMTELE - This base complies daily logs
indicating all arrivals, demrtures and,
where possible, identities of research person
visiting or working at the
largest
-


14/20/2000
SECRET
-4-
This information is particularly useful in keeping track of
LIMERICK personnel and asstating with the identification of
visitors to the installation. Also, LIMITED maintains a
summary attendance list of LIMERICK employees on a daily
basis; this enables the Statton quickly to ascertain the
presence or absence of an employee on any given day.
Finally, one other significant service is performed by this
base, the radio dispatching of the LIEMBRACE surveillance
team on LIMERICK personnel and targets of opportunity.
LIMITED's photographic coverage is still concentrated on
visitors to the installation. Also, LIMERICK personnel
has been taken, as a recent example of the base's contributions to
Station efforts is the case of Joseph Ralph MAURI. In this
case, a LIENYOY lead indicated that an American might visit
the LIMERICK target on a certain day. The base was altered
to dispatch the radio-controlled surveillance team on any
person appearing to be an American. The results of this
assignment were indicated in MEXI-6392 and several other
cables. LIMITED was also able to provide photographs,
which when compared with photographs provided by Head-
line, which was a very good way to design a new screen.
b. LILYRIC - This base's output of high-quality clandestine
photographs has been in about the same quantity as last year.
In addition, the base operator, LIMERTY-14, prepares weekly
reports on LIMERICK employees and their wires, IILYRIC
also performs the assignment of noting and reporting the
license plate numbers of all cars bringing visitors to the
LIMERICK installation. LILYRIC photographs also are con-
centrated on visitors to the target, as opposed to employees,
It should be noted that LILYRIC operates for photographic
coverage during the hours from daylight to 1400 hours each
day of the week except Sunday. The LIMITED base maintains
photographic coverage from 1400 hours to darkness each day
except Sunday.
c. LICALLA - As reported in previous correspondence, the
LICALLA base contributes to the collection of operational
information through photographic coverage of LIMERICK
employees and their families. Also, the base operator,
SECRET


14/0000
SECRET/
-5-
LIEMPTY-9, supplies extremely worthwhile information
pertaining to the apparent positions and jobs of the target
employees. He accomplishes this objective by careful
observation and analysis. LICALLA also maintains a daily
attendance roster of all LIMERICK employees. LICALLA
coverage of the target, both photographic and physical
observations, enables the Station to keep abrest of LIMERICK
personnel changes, a vital contribution to the Station's counter-
espionage effort.
2. "To collect operational information and identify operational leads
pertaining to Station targets of opportunity. The LIENTRAP operation,
handled by GERENDE, is the major contributor to this objective. It
has been possible for LIENTRAP to take photographs and to perform
pretext investigations in support of numerous Station activities. The
cases listed below are cited as examples:
a. In the case of Cesar CONZALEZ Sanchez (see I, A, 3, a, above)
LIENTRAP was able to procure photographs of CONZALEZ at his
Mexico City residence which, when compared to Headquarters
provided photographs, left no doubt that CONZALEZ was the
subject of interest to Headquarters.
b. LIENTRAP confirmed the identity of Olga CASTILLO de Ledon,
a frequent visitor to the LIMERICK installation and an ardent
supporter of the present Cuban regime, through a pretext
investigation of the residents of an apart ment building where
CASTILLO was believed to live. Later, LIENTRAP supported the
results of the Investigation with excellent photographs of the
subject.
3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e., rent
hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-survellances."
GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for
other Station operations and activities. GERENDE's comprehensive
area knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make
him an extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities.
GERENDE also procures post office box letter drops for the many
Station operations requiring them.

4. It is the Station's conclusion that the money and case officer time
expended on this segment of the LIEMPTY project is worthwhile and
should be continued in view of the quality and quantity of operational
information produced,
C. Simon D, CLACKETT Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):
1. "To collect operational information and to identify operational leads
perraining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity, "
During this project year the LIJERSEY surveillance team under the
direction of CLACKETT began contributing to the Station's support
efforts through pretext investigations and physical surveillances. Some
examples of the team's work are listed below:
a. Rafael TISCHLER Guzman (201-64372) is a Guatemalan
Communist which the team had under surveillance from
November 1959 to April 1960. The surveillance, together
with information acquired from other sources, eventually
resulted in an unsuccessful recruitment attempt on TISCHLER.
b. Pericles FRANCO Ornes (201-64546) - FRANCO Is a
Dominican of interest to the Station. The LIJERSEY team
devoted portions of five mouths, January to May 1960, collecting
information on subject through physical surveillance.
c. Jose María "Chema" LOPEZ Valdizon (201-
) was the
subject of a physical surveillance during May and June 1960.
LOPEZ was later deported from Mexico through the efforts
of LITEMPO-2.
d. CLACKETT and the LIJERSEY team performed numerous
pretext investigations on Station targets of opportunity and on
three separate occasions during the project year served as
a counter-surveillance escort for Station officers in other
operations.
2. CLACKETT, just prior to his resignation in August 1960, spent
about five weeks giving tradecraft and operational skills training to
LITEA-1. Although not specifically covered by the project objectives,
this ability on CLACKETT's part is considered a significant con-
tribution to the Station's support efforts.

3. In view of CLACKETT's resignation, which was effective 31
August 1960, and the proposed transfer of the LIJERSEY team to
the LITEMPO project, this segment of the LIEMPTY project will
not be renewed. However, for the record, it is considered that
the CLACKETT segment of LIEMPTY was worthwhile and the
expenditure of Station assets in connection with LIJERSEY operations
were justified.
D. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:
It can readily be noted that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to
many Station operations and in this manner has been a contributing factor
to the furtherance of the Related Mission Directive. The project has not
produced any positive intelligence nor has it been intended that it should
do so. The project's sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for the
development of operational information in support of other Station
operations.
II.
CHANGES
A. Simon D. CLACKETT
The unexpected resignation of CLACKETT in August 1960 has
necessitated the decision as how best to utilize the LIJERSEY surveillance
team and still benefit from the training and experience gained by the team
during the past year. As explained in the LITEMPO project outline, It was
decided that the LITEMPO Staff Agent would have the time, the need and the
requirements to handle and manage the LIJERSEY team on a regular basis;
consequently, the Station believed that such a solution to this problem would
permit the Station to continue to profit from CLACKETT's past efforts.
B. Oliver G. SCANTLING
Since CLACKETT's departure, SCANTLING has been handling the
LIJERSEY team as an interim measure pending Headquarters approval of
the LITEMPO project. SCANTLING has been exposed to, and likewise
knows, only one of the team members, LIEMPTY-20, SCANTLING is
known to L-20 only by an atlas.

5. There have been no other personnel changes within the LIEMPTY
project, excepting the resignations of Simon D. CLACKETT and
Wilma J. FIORDALISI,
III.
EFFECTIVENESS
A. General comments pertaining to the value of the project efforts to the
Station's needs - The Station is of the opinion that its operations are only
as good as the support mechanisms backcropping and contributing to them.
The availability of unilateral support agents and organizations, such as
the LIEMPTY Project, to investigate leads and to collect operational
information is an indispensable ingredient to the Station's espionage and
counteresplonage objectives. The Station would be seriously handicapped
in its operational activities should the support services of such agents as
CERNEDE, SCANTLING and the agents under their control be suddenly
made unavailable.
B. LIMERICK Target - The basis for most of the Station's counter-
expionage activities directed against the LIMERICK target require detailed
knowledge of the identity, activities and fellow associates of LIMERICK
personnel. The LIEMPTY photographic bashocuses undoubred by provide
more of this type information than any other Station operation. The
production from LIEMPTY photographic bases and from the LIE.NVOY
project provide the Station with the large majority of LIMERICK leads.
SECRET


14/20/2000

C. Targets of Opportunity - The immediate availability of independent
assets to perform investigations, photographic assignments and other
essential types of support services in connection with Station targets of
opportunity represent an operational advantage which this Station considers
highly significant. It is due to such LIEMPTY assets that an agent can be
sent to distant areas in Mexico to do investigations, that photographs can
be made of individuals and places which are of operational interest and
apartments and hotel rooms can be acquired in fictitious names in
support of sensitive operations and activities.
D. Although the progress and success of any support project depends
upon requirements from other Station operations, it must be concluded
that Project LIEMPTY has indeed been effective during the past project
year.
IV.
PROBLEMS
A. Security - The activities of the LICALLA base were suspended in
September 1960 as a direct result of the arrest of three KURIOT
technicians by the Cuban Government. One of the technicians was known
to have knowledge of the four LIMUST units (LICALLA is located in one
of these units) and the Statton considered it appropriate to suspend photo-
graphic operations pending resolution of the situation. At this time,
there is no indication when LICALLA operations will be resumed. The
LICALLA base operator has reported that there have been no unusual
tunities or other suspicious actions which might indicate that LICALLA
has been compromised to LIMERICK personnel; however, such a
possibility will exist until the release of the three technicians. No
other security problems have occurred during the past year.
V.
PLANS
A. Processing of Photographs - During the past year considerable
progress has been made in the Station's handling, i.e., sorting, indexing,
identifying leads and filing, of photographs produced by the several bases.
B. Photographic Techniques - The previous LIEMPTY Project Renewal
Request indicated that the Station planned to try new techniques using
HY-PAN film in night photography- HY-PAN film was used on n trial
basis during daylight hours with poor results. Almost invariably, prints
SECRET/


SECRET/
-10-
from HY-PAN negatives were too gratny and, consequently, were of
little use. in producing good Identified shots of individuals. In view
of these experiments, night photography has not yet been attempted,
It should be noted that Eastman Kodak's new TRI-X PAN film, which
all bases and LIENTRAP now use, is superior to any film previously
used by the Station for clandestine photography. The quality of all
base photographs have been increased considerably as a direct result
of this new film.
C. General Comments - The Station believes that the GERENDE
segment is now operating under optimum organizational arrangements
and there are no plans for expansion contemplated at this time. It is
expected that SCANTLING will soon be relieved of his interlm
responsibility for the LIERSEY team and can concentrate more on his
investigative and casting activities. The transfer of the LIERSEY team
to Project LITEMPO reduced Project LIEMPTY activities by an
appreciable amount. It is not planned; during the coming year, to
expand present LIEMPTY activities.
VI.
COSTS
A. Past Project Year - Station finance records Indicate that Project
LIEMPTY expended $19, 120, 91 during Fiscal Year 1960 (1 December
1959 - 30 June 1960) and has thus far during Fiscal Year 1961 (through
31 October 1960) expended $16, 734, 69. Contract Agents salaries and
allowances paid by Headquarters bring the total expenditures for 11
months of the project year to approximately $40, 000. 00. An additional
$4,000, 00 will be obligated during the 12th month of the project year.
This will bring total project expenditures to about $54, 000. 00 for the
entire project year.
B. Ensuing Period - Of the total $53, 000. 00 budget, itemized below,
$31, 900, 00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year
1961 and the balance, $21, 100. 00, should be expended during Fiscal
Year 1962. Normal accounting procedures will be used for all
expenditures.

VII. EMERGENCY CONDITIONS
IN Expendancy requirement listed in CSI-F NO. 230-60, Annex A, for
communications arrangements in the event of 'Emergency Conditions. "
the Station does not anticipate that this project would or could continue
to function under its present objectives. However, both principal
agents, SCANTLING and GERNEDE, would very possibly be worthwhile
sources of information to maintain contact with under any adverse
conditions. Both these agents identify themselves, in terms of
delivery, motiva of and perspective, more as Americans than as
more, nationals on which they are, it is reasonable to assume, there-
fore, and that SCANTLING is a GRESENDE would become valuable contacts
in any emergency situation.
SECRET
US
1.7:


The Station is aware that the previous project renewal stated that
emergency communications arrangements were being made. The
Station has finally obtained the U.S. addresses of relatives through
whom GERENDE and SCANTLING could be contacted under most
situations. This information will be forwarded separately.

E904-14093, 13 November 1999
1. The LIMITY Project was rensued on 8 January 1960 for the
period 1 December 1999 through 31 November 1960 for a total of $46,910;
$48,485 for fiscal year 1960 and $36,425 for fiscal year 1961.
2. The following staff comments were made during the normal precesses
a. KUEBSK notes that the CI value of the project is
difficult to judge aince it appears that much of the saterial
produced remains in the Station for explitation. However,
KUEBSK remarks that the value of the project should be increased
when the GLACKEY surveillance team enters into station
RUEBSK suggests that the Station be quized as to the pretext or
circumstances under which SANLLEN Frequently lists Inos Pareia
do Korma, the occupant of the property aisement to the Soviet
.
Note: KUEBSK/ORS notes that while the project reviow presents
a clear picture of the ains and objectives of the various seg-
ments, it does not provide, except in the case of SCANTLING,
detailed indication of the proposed increase of the other seg-
ments, and the top bietographic activity. KUTUBE/ORS
requests that the Station provide such an appraisal during the
first quarter of 1960. KUTUBE/ORS recommenda strongly
photoco average to revised from the National and use-
ment of the project. The number of whether the LUMRIO activity
could not be safely eliminated and the additional photographio
coverage conducted on a more selective basis, without materially
affecting overall usfifinas. KUTUBE/ORS notes that the
obances of further proof of usefulness, the number of heterograply and
moving pictures appear to be an unnecessary, KUTUBE/ORS
and
the results the control heating of the KUEBSKIT segment and requests
that this must provide action include samples of the team's
gregress.
3. The TVA approval for the additional vehicle was farvaried umzr
Dispatch No. HPS-1211. The NY number assigned by JERCHO is MY 2220.
The usual Delegation of Procurement authority is being forwarded by
JERCHO channels.

Room 2121 Bertgon
Ext. 2555
Date 9 December 1959
1. It is requested that the LIEHTY Project be renewed for the
period 1 December 1959 through 30 November 1960 for a total of
$84,910.00; $48,185.00 for fiscal year 1960 and $36,425.00 for fiscal
year 1961. LIEHTY was last approved for the period 1 December 1958
through 30 November 1959 for a total of $95,380; of which it is
estimated $74,259 has been obllgated.
2. It is requested that the Project be renewed on the basis
of the Project review prepared by the Station which is attached.
3. The security incident referred to in paragraph IV.B on
page 6 of the attachment, occurred on 20 September 1959. While on
the basis of the Project, the Project is not a part of the Project
temperarily detained by the Servicio Secroto de Mexico (Mexican Secret
Service). At the time of the incident the LIEHTFAP vehicle was
carrying out an assignment of photographing a Cuban rally which it
was not a part of the Project. The Project has losing Mexican and
Central American Communists. The police worker who was not
meeting for the purpose of preventing a Communist-inspired demonstra-
tion and they searched LIEHTFAP believing it might contain Communist
and Political Affairs. The Department of the film, the truck and
LIEHTFY-10 with the belief the Communist has had been involved
techniques used by the police against some persons attending the rally.
LIEHTY-10 was held under unofficial custody for approximately 26 hours
before his release was obtained. When a member of the Station using
the LIEHTFAP vehicle, the President of the President of the
the film, LIEHTFAP, and all the equipment were also returned in toat.
LIEHTY-10 had not been interrogated and had not been formally charged
or booked. Although the FBI representative and the U.S. Embassy Security
Officer also learned of the incident, the Station does not believe that
this incident has materially affected the security of the Project. The
Station, however, is allowing a one month's cooling of period for the
LIEHTFAP vehicle and LIEHTFIP-10.

REVIEW OF PROJECT LIMPTY
(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)
1.
PRODUCT OF THE PROJECT
A.
Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):
1.
"To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities. During the past year SCANTLING has devoted
a significant amount of time to the furtherance of this project objective. Although
other Station operations and personnel are also concerned with the collection of
operational information about LIMERICK personnel, SCANTLING's contributions
are unique as to type and complement information received from other sources. For
example, SCANTLING is used primarily as the source of information about LIMERICK
physical facilities. He is constantly on the alert for building modifications, con-
tinued to the project objectives. The project objectives are based on the
installation. He regularly visits Inex PARADA de Moreno, the occupant of property
adjacent to LIMERICK, for the purpose of obtaining a close view of the interior
grounds of LIMERICK and to debrief Sonora de Moreno about any unusual activities
which she may have-observed. At the present time SCANTLING is preparing a
thorough casing report on the electrical power supply used by LIMERICK and all
other residences and establishments in the same block. This operational information
is intended to be used as well as use and will show all transformers in the block, electrical
systems for measuring the electrical power supply. This is a key component of the
where wires enter each property. Because of his other sensitive activities and
because other operational activities provide adequate coverage, SCANTLING
has been used sparingly for physical surveillances and investigations which might
conceivably impair his future usefulness to the Station. During the time he spent
training Simon D. CLACKETT (ps) in radio controlled mobile surveillance,
SCANTLING did perform some surveillance work as the LIMERICK installation;
however, it was concerned mostly with briefing CLACKETT on dispatching tech-
niques and the procedures used for the control of several vehicles on a surveillance
team using two-way radio control.
The project is subject operational information pertaining to other targets of
opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence interest
operating in Mexico. By far the most important contribution made by SCANTLING
in connection with this project objective has been his support to the LITACIT
operation and just recently actually gained entry to the LITACIT target using a
pretext cover story. During this visit SCANTLING managed to collect highly
valuable operational information about the security of the installation, which has
added materially to KUBARK's knowledge about the target. SCANTLING has also
caused and prepared reports on the LITABBY target in anticipation of mounting
S E C R E T

a photographic surveillance and in initial preparation for a future LINIMENT type
activity. SCANTLING has performed investigations of numerous other Station
targets of opportunity which, depending on their significance, have been reported
in separate correspondence.
3.
"To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings
and surveillance." This objective was included in the LLEMPTY project because
SCANTLING is used to follow up LIFEAT leads and leads obtained from the LLEMPTY
photographic bases. During the past year SCANTLING has investigated a quantity of
the
exposed from the above sources. The information resulting from these in-
volved examinations were conducted to maintain current data various firms
used by the LLEMEIGK target and in the LLEMEIGK target. The DALLEMEIGK
tobacco
caused the Station to make a recruitment pitch in an effort to carry out a technical
penetration of the LMEIRICK target. Although VIDALES was not recruited, the
Station anticipates that SCANTLING will some day be successful in just this type of
activity. SCANTLING is the Station's principal source for the follow-up of LIFEAT/
LMEIRICK and LLEMPTY photographic base house leads as they pertain to the
primary target.
4.
Not covered by a specific project objective but, nevertheless, of
significant importance to the Station are SCANTLING's contributions to the overall
Station supply efforts. In addition to the extensive training given to CLACKETT,
SCANTLING also prepared a detailed and sophisticated radio dispatch procedure for
use by the LLEMEIGK target. The LLEMEIGK target was used to evaluate the
numbering streets which enables the radio surveillance team to specify a location
without reference to street names and areas. The entire radio dispatch code, when
used properly, practically defies identification as the conversations of a clandestine
surveillance team. From the standpoint of Station security, SCANTLING conducted
an investigation of LIVESTOCK-2 based on two leads which were 30 years old and
reported significant information which contributed to the Station's final decision
to terminate LIVESTOCK-2. SCANTLING's other support activities consist of renting
hotel rooms and apartments in fictitious names, supporting operations such as
LICOOL-12 by performing sentry duty and by serving as a capable and responsible
cutout between the Station and agents from other geographical areas.
5. Although SCANTLING's LLEMPTY objectives can never be completely
fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made important and valuable
contributions to LLEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to other Station
activities in general. SCANTLING's production, measured against monetary
expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors, unquestionably justifies
his continuation as an integral part of Project LLEMPTY.

Raymond H. GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):
S E C R E T /

1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities through the use of photographic base homes, "
This continuing objective is carried out by three photographic base homes, "
LIMITED, LILYRIC and LIGLIA. During the project year, the proposed
approximately 3600 photographs and LILYRIC about 4500 pictures of individuals
entering and leaving the LIMERICK target. Most of these photographs were of
non-LIMERICK individuals of which only a small, but significant, percentage
could be identified through license plate checks or other types of routine investi-
gation. The LIGALLA base produced approximately 4300 photographs during the year.
Most of the LIGALLA photographs were of LIMERICK employees and their families
and have been of considerable value in maintaining current and accurate listings
of LIMERICK personnel in Mexico. The LIGALLA base has recently begun taking
a
single
of
the
LIMERICK
personnel
and
the
LIMERICK
employees
and
the
movies
are being forwarded to KUTUBE/D for the possible exploitation of lip
reading analysis. The LIMITED base, in addition to its photographic assignment,
is also used as the radio central for dispatching the LIMERBACE surveillance
team on LIMERICK personnel targets. All bases make routine reports on the daily
attendance of LIMERICK employees at the installation which facilitates the Station's
reporting on the arrival and departure of LIMERICK personnel. Also, the bases
devote time to reporting the personal associations among the numerous LIMERICK
employees. Some of this latter type information is valuable from the standpoint of
confirming that LIMERICK intelligence officers have a tendency to associates with
their colleagues.
2. "To collect operational information and identify operational
leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." This is a broad objective
and one which is contributed to by the LIENTRAP operation. LIENTRAP is used
to provide photographic coverage of important Station targets which do not justify
a more permanent photographic base. During the period under review, LIENTRAP
has been used for the timely coverage of various Central American exile group
activities, the Confederacion de Trabajadores de la America Latina (CTAL)
headquarters, several counterespionage targets, the LITACIT and LITABBY
targets and other one-time operations of intelligence interest. The operational
information produced by LIENTRAP is uscd by the Station for increasing
operational knowledge about a target and, when appropriate, has been incorporated
in separate reports to Headquarters with other information about specific targets.
3.
"To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e., rent
hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances." GERENDE,
because of his area knowledge and operational acumen, is used frequently by the
Station for renting hotel rooms and apartments in fictitious names for use on other
Station operations. He is also the Station's principal procurer of local Post Office
boxes for use as letter drops. This objective pertains entirely to the operational
support of other Station operations and is an invaluable ingredient to the security
of important Station activities.

The production of operational information as represented by
LIMITED, LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP is an important adjunct to the
Station's coverage of the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity.
It is the Station's conclusion that the expenditure of KUBARK assets, i.e., money
and case officer time, is justified and that these activities should be continued.
C. Simon D. CLACKETT Segment (discussed in relation to project objectives):
1. "To collect operational information and to identify operational
leads pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity. " Very
little production has been realised from this objective in terms of CLACKETT's
contributions. CLACKETT returned to Mexico in early April 1959 after receiving
surveillance, tradecraft and photography training in Headquarters. He then spent the
rest of April, and part of June being trained by SCANTLING in mobile sur-
veillance techniques, and the new product of the LIMERICK target was
supervision and he began training these agents in the arts of foot surveillance and
mobile surveillance. This team, known as the LIVERSEY team, is just beginning to
show the excellent effects of CLACKETT's intensive training sessions. Although
LEANPTY-17 has resigned and the team consists of only four agents, including
CLACKETT, the Station believes that the team will be ready within the next month
to begin its contributions to the above objective.
2. Based on the training time devoted to CLACKETT and to the LILERSEY
team and the anticipated production during the coming project year, it is the Station's
opinion that this activity should be continued.
II.
EXTENT TO WHICH THE RELATED MISSION DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN
FURTHERED.
Project LIEMPTY has provided support, in varying ways, to a majority of
Station operations and in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherance
of the Related Mission Directive. The project is not intended nor designed to
produce positive intelligence; its sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for the
development of operational information in support of other Station operations.
III.
PROGRESS OF THE OPERATION AND PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.
A.
Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment:
1. SCANTLING's duties and responsibilities are basically the same
now as they were when the original LEMPTY project outline was submitted. Since
SCANTLING is the only major factor in this part of LEMPTY, progress, other than
covered in the above section on production, can be measured only by the fact that
SCANTLING is a year older and has acquired a few more helpful tricks of the trade
S E C R E T


14/20/2000
SECRET
- 5 -
and, consequently, has increased his own operational abilities.
2.
Insofar as future planning is concerned, SCANTLING will
continue to devote the greater portion of his time to the LITACIT operation. In
addition, he will continue his work against the LIMERICK target, i.e., investi-
gating LIFET and photographic base house leads in connection with the objectives
of the LIFEMPTY and LIMESA projects. The Station still plans to maintain
SCANTLING as an independent Station asset free from the responsibilities of super-
vising other agents and operations.
3.
SCANTLING will probably continue providing administrative
support to LEMPTY-3 (now covered under the LICOOL project), but will not be
responsible for the operational direction of L-3.
B.
Raymond H. GERENDE Segment:
During the past year the three photographic base houses have
been trained in the use of a faster type film (HY-PAN) to facilitate the taking of
photographs on dark cloudy days. One base, LICALLA, has made tests and recently
begun making 35mm color alides using the new fast type Ektachrome film. This
film is now processed in the Mexico Station dark room which heretofore was not
possible. It is the Station's opinion that a few color photographs of target personnel
will be useful for identification purposes. The LICALLA Base has also, during the
past year, begun taking 16mm motion pictures in color with the expectation that
Headquarters can eventually provide lip passing analysis of conversations taking
place in the garden area of the LIMERICK installation.
2.
Other operational progress has been made in connection with
relieving GERENDE of responsibility for the LITERSEY surveillance team. This
mow leaves GERENDE with a sufficient amount of time to supervise all photographic
base houses, LIENTRAP and the outside photographic laboratory.
3.
Future planning in relation to this segment does not call for
expansion. Rather, the Station plans to perfect some of the photographic procedures
now in use and to experiment with night photography possibilities using the fast
HY-PAN film with telephoto lens of varying lengths. GERENDE will also concentrate
on increasing the security and communications procedures used with each base.
C.
Simon D. CLACKETT Segment:
1.
CLACKETT'T's assumption of responsibility for the LIJERSEY
surveillance team has been a progressive step for the development of an additional
and much needed support asset. Although the LIJERSEY team has been in existence
for several years, it was only during the past year, with the assignment of
S E C R E T/


14/20/00
SECRET
- 6 -
- I CLACKETT, that an intensive effort was made to train the team members and to
place them under the supervision of a full time team leader. As mentioned above,
CLACKETT has done an excellent job during the past few months in getting the
team ready for future operational assignments.
2.
The Station plans, during the coming year, to increase the
strength of the LITERSEY team by at least two agents and one car. This would
then give a total LIVERSEY complement of six agents and three radio cars. The
Station will continue to take all necessary precautions not to rush the development
of the team nor to give it assignments which are too complicated and too difficult.
It is anticipated that the team will begin some surveillance work within the next
month on targets connected with plans for an expanded Communist Party pene-
tration program.
IV. PERFORMANCE OF PRINCIPAL AGENTS IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION,
SECURITY AND COVER.
A.
Oliver G. SCANTLING - As should be expected from a well trained
and motivated agent, SCANTLING's production during the period under review was
excellent. His production is in the category of operational information rather than
positive intelligence and is based on leads and investigations given him by the
Station. He never fails to do a thorough and detailed job on all assignments
given to him. He is an unusually valuable, principal agent, There have been no
security problems or developments during the past year in connection with
SCANTLING's assignments. Likewise, his cover is very good and places him
in a position to maintain his work for KUBARK for many years to come.
B.
Raymond H. GERENDE - Since GERENDE's marriage in December
1958, his performance has improved to a marked degree. He has become one
of the Station's most dependable agents in terms of promptness for meetings,
completing operational assignments as rapidly as possible and in doing any task,
regardless of how menial it may be. Insofar as the Station and GERENDE know,
his cover with LISTERINE's firm has held up very well. In fact, GERENDE
recently was able to negotiate a sales contract with a customer having a very
large sales capacity for the product manufactured by LISTERINE's firm. This.
of course, endears GERENDE to LISTERINE in addition to contributing to
GERENDE's cover employment. The only significant security incident pertaining,
in part, to GERENDE was in connection with LENTRAF (please see IHMA-13951,
to October 1959, for details).
C.
Simon D. CLACKETT - CLACKETT's performance has definitely
measured up to the standards expected by the Station. He has proved that he
is conscientious, dependable and very quick in grasping the details of clandestine
activities. He will undoubtedly continue to improve his personal performance as
S E C R E T
-


14/0000
- 7 -
he gains more experience. There have been no security problems or incidents in
connection with CLACKETT's assignment to this Station. Although the notional
cover provided by Headquarters has held up very well during the past few months,
the Station had hopes of placing him in LILABEL's firm and obtaining Inmigrante
papers for him. However, for reasons mentioned in other correspondence, this
cover arrangement did not work out. The Station is continuing efforts to locate
another suitable local cover job for CLACKETT.
V.
CONTACT AND COMMUNICATION.
A.
Oliver G. SCANTLING - The Station Case Officer meets with SCANTLING
on the average of three times each week. For regular meetings, a total of eight
prearranged contact points are used alternately with SCANTLING "walking the beat"
and being picked up by the Case Officer in the latter's car. This procedure enables
both the agent and the case officer to check themselves and to check each other for
possible surveillance. Meetings are generally of short duration, seldom more than

3 February 1959
MEXGRANDUM FOR: Chief, FI/OF8
FROM
: Chief, WHO
SUBJECT
: LITTY Project
1. Reference is made to your comments on the IERTY Project which was
approved on 16 January 1959.
2. The LISNITY Project provides for the development of the former
LIVERSEY nurvollinone team, the maintenance of photo aurovillinoo bases, and
other support facilities for the Mexico City Nation. In their review of the
LIVERSEY's work, the LIVERSEY's work is a major role in the development
of
gradual reduction of the considerable financial and personnel commitments in
this project in view of the favorably developing LENTOY liaison relationship.
FI/OF8 believed that a smaller, more menagable support group with greater
emphasis on selectivity of tasks and targets could well result in more effective
CI and FI productivity.
3. The LIVERSEY took wishes to point out that rather than reducing the
assessments of the LIZTY Project, WHO believes that the this project is
an extremely important one and should receive Neadquarters support. The only
other Station surveillance teams, LIVERSEYK and LIVERSEA, are both known
to the Mexican authorities. Therefore LIZTY remains the Station's only
secure surveillance asset. It is a very small untirained unit at present, but
through this project is will be developed into a useful, valuable asset.
4. We are not passing FI/OF8 comment to the field, because WII Division
bells a new program for the development of the LIVERSEY's work. We
Fret, the liniaco has n-t yet been firmly established. Secondly, even with a
good liaison relationship, the Mexican services must be considered anything but
secure, and certainly could not be trusted with any sensitive operations.
Thirdly, because of its proximity to the United States, and the activity of
hostile intelilionce groups there, the Mexico City Station is aniled upon to
support many very sensitive operations which we would never wish to reveal to
the Mexican authorities.
5. Experiences in other Latin


Page 2
2. Experiences in other Latin American countries where liaison has been
established, has shown that many Station's tend to reduce their unilateral
operations and expands sites in favor of this liaison. Under these circumstances,
the organization is a major challenge in the survey of the liaison
service and a change in the attitude of the service toward cooperating with
this Agency has left these Statins virtually helpless. The certainly cannot
recommend that the Mexico Station reduce any of it's unilateral support assets
in favor of a proposed liaison relationship.

1. The Field Project Outline submitted with NO-A-11257 was approved
on 16 January 1959 without chance, for the period 1 December 1958 through
30 November 1959 for a total of 395,300; $65,580 for the current fiscal
year and 429,800 for fiscal year 1960.
2. An amendment to the original request for project approval was
submitted before the original project was approved. This amendment
requested approval to include Simon D. CLACKT? (ps) and William J. FORMALISI
(ps) under the LIFTY Project effective 1 January 1959 and 1 December
from the LIFESII Project. This amendment was approved. Original FPO for
free the LIFESII Project. This amendment was used to cover the expenses for CLACKETT
and FIONADLLISI. Therefore no additional funds were requested for the
project in this amendment. The approval on 16 January 1959 included this
project amendment. A copy of the amendment request is being forwarded
for your information and records.
3. Among the Staffs' comments on the LIFETY Project, the following
recommendations were made. AUDÉX'S suggested that the Case Officer should
work at devising ostealthies of incomes for the agents which will
stand the scientific needs, relatives and less friendly forces.
The amendment to CLACKETT a contract has been requested to allow
for a quarter allowance. The educational allowance requested in paragraph
11 of the project amendment was disp:roved because CLACKETT was a Contract
Agent. The quarters Allowance of $2,500 was turned down because it was too
high in relation to CLACKETT's salary. Therefore, a contract was
$1,800 has been applied to the proposed project. CLACKETT's contract. If,
the contract is not available and cover reasons require CLACKETT to rent an apartment
larger 'tan the one he would normally obtain under his allowance, the Chief
of Station can authorise the extra rent as an operational expense which will
not be considered as compensation for CLACKETT and therefore not subject to
federal income tax.
5. Please advise headquarters whether you wish to have the cryptonyas
for CLACKETT and FIONADLLISI charged to LIG-PTY's.

LILYRIC - This Base has been in operation for about two and one-half years
and is located in an apartment building arco s the street from the LIMRICK
installation. As in the case of the LIMITED Base, LILYRIC takes photographs of
the LIMRICK and the LIMRICK's building. The LIMRICK's building is a 100
LILYRIC photographs are handled in the same manner as the LIMITED pictures. In
addition to taking photographs; the LILYRIC operators also prepare daily logs on the
activities of each LIMRICK employee, record the license plate numbers of most cars'
carrying people to and from the LIMRICK installation, and prepare an observation
diary on all target personnel seen each day. (This permits the Station to tell when
a "target" design of the LIMRICK design. The LIMRICK design is not a
"target" design.
The LIMRIC Base was originally acquired and made operative to provide for
continuous coverage of the target in the event LIMITED is ever compromised. This
is still the primary value of having two bases cover the same portion of the target.
LILYRIC is compartmented from LIMITED and with the possible exception of GREENDE
could probably weather any security flap involving LIMRICK. Obviously, there is
some duplication in the work of LIMITED and LILYRIC; however, the insurance value
of having two basis is quite apparent.
LILYRIC has been operating for about two and one-half years and insofar as
the Station knows, no compromising security situations have arisen.
LICALLA - The LICALLA Base is located in a position where photographs can be
taken of people within the LIMRICK garden area. In addition, the operator of the
LIMRICK's building is a 100-100 square square, which is a 100-100 square daily logs show-
ing then a target individual was seen that day, and reports showing the association
of target individuals with one another. LICALLA photographs are processed and handled
in the same manner and by the people who handle the LIMICED and LILYRIC pictures.
The LICALLA Base was acquired and operations began about two and one-half
years ago with the primary purpose of obtaining additional operational information
concerning LIMRICK personnel, and operational leads which could be exploited for
the physical penetration of the LIMRICK installation. Approximately one year ago
was a 100-100 square square square, which was a 100-100 square daily logs
remain at its present location and will continue to submit photographs and reports
of the same type as are now being submitted. Other than the fact that LIMCTY-9,
the LICALLA operator, is the brother of former LIPSTICK-47, no security problems are
currently known to the Case Officer. However, reports from LIPSTICK 12 and 39, the
local police, the attorneys involved in the case, the foreign embassy concerned and
the LIPSTICK tests give no indications that LIMICTY-9 was ever mentioned during
the LIMICED.
LIMTRAP - This is a panel type truck equipped with cameras, telescopic
lens and other types of photographic equipment. It has been used during the past
two years as an investigative asset. The truck is parked about 75 yards from a
target of interest (usually a residence or apartment building) and the photographer
in the rear of the truck photographs individuals or things of interest to the Station.
LEXINGTON, the LIMICED and LIMICED for any station to have and has enabled this Station to
be a private of individual which could have been obtained in no other way. LIMICTY-
90 and 11 operate LIMTRAP.

The major security threat to LIEMTRAP is the fact that it has been operating
for about two years in all parts of the city and should soon be replaced by a truck
of a different make. Provision for this is made in Section 15 of this Field Project
Outline.
LLERESBY - This is presently an approved project; however, it is believed
adviseable for administrative efficiency to include the LIERESBY assets within the
framework of the LIEMPTY Project. Other than LIEMTRAP, which has already been
relied to the U.S. Department of Commerce, is a major part of the U.S. by
15, 16 and 17. LIEMPTY 15 and 16 have been employed for about one and a half years
and LIEMPTY-17 for about one year. They have not developed into as competent a surveil-
lance team as the LIPESTICK team was and probably never will become as good. The
LIERESBY team has been 'used mostly for stationary surveillance and observations of
the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. government. The U.S. has been working on a greater
He has excelled at this type of work and the Station continues to use him in this
capacity. The Station has been reluctant to use the LIERESBY team as much as it
could have been used because of the close association of the team with GERRAIS and,
in turn, GERRAIS's knowledge and work on LIPESTK and the LIPESTICK surveillance team.
The Station plans to recruit several agents of a type and social level more suitable
for all employees and the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. government.
Oliver G. SCANTLING - SCANTLING has been associated with KUBARK for several
years in a number of different capacities. He was originally used as a member of
the LIPESTICK surveillance team and later was head of the same team. He has been
used to train new agents in the techniques of surveillance and investigation, to
provide a new system for the U.S. and the U.S. government. He has been
investigations and make recruitment approaches to individuals of operational interest
to KUBARK. SCANTLING is currently being used by the Station as an investigator of
LMESA leads andis still actively pursuing the LEMPA/KIKIHTING operation.
SCANTLING also maintains regular contact with LIEMPTI-3 and monitors his elicitation
effort against the LIGCOL-6 target. In this connection, both SCANTLING and LIEMPTI-3
meet regularly with Boris M. KILLOO for operational guidance. (Note: Please see
the LIGCOL Field Project Outline for additional details on LIGCOL-6).

Staff Agent's activities:
g. To collect operational information and to identify operational leads
pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity.
6. Targets:
Oliver G. SCANTLING - The primary target is, of course, the LIMERICK installation
and personnel. However, SCANTLING devotes most of his time to following up LIFRAF
leads which pertain to services provided the LIMERICK installation by individuals
and firms, e.g. construction engineers, TIGOR Seaking firms, safe experts, furniture
makers, interior decorators, etc. To an extent, these are considered targets of
opportunity and it would be important to list specifically what future things the
will be used to provide a new strategy to support the development of the new
occupants of the LICOOL-6 apartment; however, LIMERTY-3, whom SCANTLING handles,
should score correctly be given credit for information produced on this target.
Haymond H. GREENDE - LIMTEED, LILYRIC and LICALLA all have as their target
the LIMERICK installation and personnel, plus any local nationals and PERFIDERS
who visit LIMERICK. LENTHAP is concerned with targets of opportunity and follow-
up investigations on operational leads obtained from other Station and Headquarters
sources. The same targets apply to the LILYRICY surveillance team as apply to
LIMERTAP.

10. Cover:
a. Raymond H. GREENDE is the only LEMTNY agent who has cover provided by
NUMBER. GEORKE ostensibly is a salesman for LISTERIES's firm. Bovever, he
selden speeds any time pursuing his cover occupation, since his operational
activities are so numerous and time consuming. GARNER'S cover with the LIFERLIES
firm was arranged by the Station and, so far, has been adequate for GREENDE's needs.


1994-A-11247

-11-172
B. The Case Officer, Gmiton F. CUSELS, is known only to GRENDE and
SCANTLING. It would not be possible to develop a suitable cover story that
would apply to the frequent meetings between the Case Officer and the Principal
Agents; therefore, meetings are clandestine and are usually conducted in the
Case Officer's car. However, suitable cover stories have been developed between the
Case Officer and SCANTLING and between the Case Officer and GISELDE involving back-
ground information as to have: set and how our friendship developed, to be used
in a manner that is not a matter of what is to be used in the case of the case.
c. None of the status cover occupations of any of the LIMFITY agents is
completely compatible with his operational activities. Action cover stories are
doided upon before each assignment and devised to complement each agent's status
cover as closely as possible. Base House operators, of course, generally conduct
operational assignments within the confines of their quarters; consequently, the
need for action cover stories is reduced. Appropriate cover stories exist between
GISELDE and the agents in his network and between SCANTLING and LIMFITY-3.
11. Contact and Communication:
Appropriate clandestine communications arrangements exist between the various
technologies of LIMFITY. At the same time these plans consist of regular and
concerned by the other aspects) means of contact. GISELDE and SCANTLING are both
in the process of preparing detailed written communications plans for their
respective agents which include complete regular, alternate and rapid-non
scheduled meeting arrangements. Provisions will also be made in these plans for
oral recognition signals and physical bona fides that will enable a person unknown
to be used in the case of the based error series. The Case Officer is cur-
rently working on a Warning System of the Telecommunications which will permit the ex-
penditious extiruation of GRENDE and SCANTLING from Mexico should a security
situation arise which would necessitate this.
12. Control and Motivation:
a. Control - All LIMFITTY agents are local nationals. GRENDE and SCANTLING,
both of whom spent a great deal of their childhood years in FAPRIDE and still
have relatives living in FAPRIDE, are in many respects more pro-FBPRIPE than
many FAFRIDE citizens. In the past, both GRENDE and SCANTLING have evidenced
the need for action cover stories, and the fact that the control of the system is not
and appear to be devoting that same loyalty to the present Case Officer. The
control over GRENDE and SCANTLING stems directly from their pro-FBPRIPE beliefs
and their personal loyalty to their past and present Case Officers. The control
over other LIMFITY agents is based in part on pre-FPRIPEA and the other
LIMFITY agents. The control over the GRENDE and SCANTLING.
Realistically, control over LIMFITTY agents is based on mutual understandings and
confidence among individuals and should any agent decide to denounce FERIME or
KUMAK, as the case may be, there is not much that the Station could do.
b. Motivation - With the exception of GRENDE and SCANTLING, whose primary
motivations are ideological, financial compensation seems to be the basic
motivational factor surrounding LIMFITY agents.

16. Special Problems and Commitments:
a. No commitments, expressed or implied, have been made to any LIAMPTT
agent by the present Case Officer, except as stated in the project outline and/or
in the contracts of GEPZENDE and SCAMPLING.
b. In the event of compromise to the local government of any LIAMPTY agent,
KUBARK is morally responsible for doing all within its power, and within the
limitations of security, for resettling or otherwise taking care of the LIAMPITY
agents.
a. No special benefit commitments have been made to any LIAMPITY agent except
those contained in the contracts of GEPZENDE and SCAMPLING.
d. A change of government or political conditions in Mexico will not affect
this project. It is a unilateral effort on the part of KUBARK.
