FAEQUENCY, AMBASSADOR REQUESTED STATION PULL BACK IN LTAISON
CONTACT: THIS APPLIED ONLY TO W-1 PERSONAL CONTACT.
AND NOT TO WKSCARLET LIAISON IN GENERAL).
2. AS YET STATION HAS NO HARD EVIDENCE WHICH DIRECTLY
W-3,
LINKS EITHER W-1; OR RICARDO N o R A L E S NAVARETTE TO THE
6 OCTOBER 1976 BOMBING. HOWEVER, THEIR REPORTED ASSOCIATION.
MITH ORLANDO 9 o S C P AVILA, THEIR BACKGROUNDS, AND W-3'S
PRIOR REPORTING ON TERRORIST ACTIONS SUGGEST THAT THEY: WERE
ALL AWARE TO ONE DEGREE OR ANOTHER OF PLANS FOR THE 6 OCTOBER
ACTION AND THAT NONE OF THEM ACTIVELY OPPOSED IT, OF THE.
THREE W-3 SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN MOST LIKELY IMPLICATED THROUGH
HIS POSSIBLE ASSISTANCE TO HERNAN RICARDO L o 2 A N o AND/OR
FREDDY L'U G o. W-1 AND MORALES MAY HAVE BECOME ACCESSORIES-
AFTER-THE-FACT DEPENDING UPON: THE POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT OF
ORLANDO BOSCH IN THE BOMBING AND ITS. AFTERMATH.
3. IT MAY BE WISHFUL THINKING BUT DO NOT FEEL THAT
W-3 IS IN POSITION REVEAL ANY TRUE INFORMATION WHICH COULD
IMPLICATE ANY OF HIS SEVERAL EMBASSY CONTACTS. SINCE CONTACT
WITH HIM IN RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN TO OUR KNOWLEDGE LIMITED ONLY TO
VISA ASSISTANCE AND INFORMATION

REPORTING, HE COULD AT MOST REVEAL NAMES AND TELPHONE
NUMBERS. WKSCARLET-5 EXPRESSED PERSONAL OPINION THAT N=3.
FEARING POSSIBLE RETRIBUTION FROM ORLANDO 80SCH. WOULD: NOT
DARE FIX BLANE ON BOSCH AND MIGHT. UNDER INTERROGATION
PRESSURE. ATTEMPT TO INPLICATE BOTHERALD AS HIS SPONSOR! WE
FEEL THIS POSSIBILITY IS RATHER REMOTE.
4. WKSCARLET-9 APPEARS NOT TO BE INVOLVED IN THE
ABOVE BUT HIS CUBAN BACKGROUND AND CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH
W-1, ESPECIALLY IN RECENT WEEKS, UNDOUBTEDLY HAS BROUGHT
NIM SOME-NOTICE- AND PROBABLY SUSPICION. WKSCARLET-9 HAS
NOT BEEN MET SINCE HE MISSED A MEETING IN LATE SPETEMBER:
HE CALLED IN THE NEXT DAY TO SAY THAT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO
MAKE IT. HE SUBSEQUENTLY CALLED HIS. CASE OFFICER'S HONE ONCE WHILE
HE HAS OUT BUT HAS NOT CALLED BACK TO SPECIFY A TIME FOR THE
NEXT. MEETING! HE ALSO HAS NOT RESPONDED TO THREE RECENT
RS-708 SIGNALS TO CALL IN AND ONE TO MAKE AN: EMERGENCY
MEETING ON THE NIGHT OF a OCTOBER. STATION HAS DECIDE
AGAINST CALLING NIH DURING THIS CURRENT TENSE PERIOD AT
NIS ONLY REACHABLE NUMBER-WIS AND WKNOBLE-1'S HOME. NE
WILL CONTINUE SIGNALLING AND AWAITING HIS CALL IN, FYI:

FITNESS REPORT: Ricardo Morales
SUSMITTED 3Y: - William Robertson
Ricardo was selected for the group because of
Case Officer recommendation and personal obser-
vation and his training record plus the abib ity
to speak French and English as well as Spanish.
He is particularly bright, and during the prepara-
tory and holding phase, as well as during the phase
in which he has been left behind to accompany Alberto
Perez home, he performed as required of a good
commando.
During the action he showed a surprising leadership
capability, taking over effectively a team which
needed it at the moment and continuing until he got
hit.
During a portion of the action he served as Major-
Hoare's como link with aviators whose English was
not good.
Ricardo is definitely recommended for special ops
in a lealership capacity, but it is mentioned here
that his use to KUSARK may be in a broader field and
that use as a comando may be wasting his talents.
Ricardo is not now employed at JNMAVE. He is not
felt in any way to have after-action security
concern.
