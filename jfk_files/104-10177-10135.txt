pad from other operational funds the peso equimolent of his salary bogining
I January 1952. It was considered necessary to begin his payments "s of that
date in order to insure his contiundant state (Chile. This Station would
appreciate clarification of JREDICT-chile at the, according to T.S.11-1466,
this expense could be charged for a limited time.
6.4. PULNTATRE-1's weekly newspaper is filed onned by him, and as indicated in
attached contract, he has agreed to know the paper for at least two years.
The other owner, the has taken no active interest whatsoever in the operation,
management or policies of the paper, apparently plans to sell his share.
The prospective buyer is not known but in any event FULNTATRE-1 will retain
the controlling interest.
7.1. FULNTATRE-1 is willing to spend the necessary time in Washington For
training and will be ready to support immediately when so advised. However, his
wife is expecting a baby and so December 1951 according to her doctor's
decision to make the PULNTATRE-1 would prefer to remain in Santiago for at least
a few days after the child is born. Ho is certain that the birth will take
place within a week's time and it is hoped that his presence in Washington will
not be required prior to 15 January 1952. As a cover story for his trip,
the child is not a woman who is not a woman who is not a woman who
and that a trip to New York to discuss the play with the prospective producer
is completely logical. Further, ho has an estate in Texas which is in litigation
and which could logically require his presence there. PULNTATRE-1 asked that
he allowed to spend a day or two in Texas either on his trip up or book to
settle this estate and it is recommended that he 00 allowed to do so in order to
be paid by the child.
8.1. FULNTATRE-1 has been told that he must pay United States income tax on his
salary received from this Organization. He is at a loss, however, to know how
this added income can be satisfactorily and socurly explained to the Department
of Internal Revenue. In accordance with the content of Field Regulations 50-13,
this matter is boing brought to Headquarters attention with a request for
instructions as to how this matter is to be handled.

overtly and actively in anti-Communist work and will function as
a WID mechanism for the accomplishment of WID missions (a) and (b)
in Chile, as set forth in Paragraph 1 above.
As the first step in implementing the development of that committee,
it is proposed to engage the services of a high-calibre American
national in Chile as a contract agent at an annual salary of
$6,000.00 to
1. Spot, recruit, and manage a qualified indigenous Chilean
who will act as organizer. of the aforementioned committee,
and
2. Act as cut-out and principal agent for AMD, in the
operations of the committee.

will undertake to develop the committee referred to above
in Paragraph A of this Outline.
At such time as that development warrants, an Amendment
to this Project containing a statement of all new require-
ments, will be submitted to competent authority for
approval.
IV. RECOMMENDATION
That there be allotted to this Project funds in the amount of
(4,700.00 to provide salary for FULINATOR-1 for the remainder of

has been bought, as one of his plays and that a trip to
New York to discuss the play with the prospective producer
is completely located.

Communications between FULTINATOR-1 and the Santiago
Field Station will at all times be carried on by means
of a secure cut-out.
Since FULTINATOR-1's cover is his overt business situation
in which he is already established, and since that situation
provides him with printing and publishing facilities, it is
believed the good operational security can be maintained
with a minimum of effort in this Project.

: FURBRA)
Dear 31r;
This in to acknowledge with thanis receipt of
y ur informative letter of April 23, 1953 which arrived
by steener mail. We regret that an carlier reply has
not: been possible, but the time elapsed has been vell
apent in giving your latest report and your proposal
of March 5, 1953, the serious consideration which
then deserves. we alnth sureet that your future corres-
pondence is not.
The executive beard of the Foundation hes. studied
your report of April 27, 1953 and appreciated your
comnribensive response to our request for further in-
formation. The objectivns and contemplated activities
in the promi certainly seem to be highly consistent
with the generali of the Commission. The case as such
would represent a consideration of finances asse-
tance.

1. This is to confirm and amplify reference (d), that Headquarters has
prepared the initial letter from DTHOREAS to Martin J. CORENIAS. This
letter, which requests CORENIAS to act as the "honorary" DTHOREAS repo-
resonative in Chile, is being sent air-mail to the CORENIAS residence in
the USA.
2. As an attachment to this dispatch we are forv-riding the draft of a
suggested rorly to he sent by CORENIAS to DTHOREAS, via air mail. CORENIAS
need not use our suggested letter verbatim, as long as he does incorporate
in his reply the ideas contained in our draft.
3. Upon receipt of the letter of acceptance from CORENIAS, DTHOREAS will
send CORENIAS a letter of introduction to FURHEIRAL. DTHOREAS will also,
at the same time, alert FURHEIRAL to the anticipated contact, asking him
to put CORENIAS in touch with TURERIAL-1.
4. For security reasons ver are not enclosing co-rics o' the initial PUEAREAS
letter to CORENIAAS. It is suggested that station make its on file copies
of the letters sent directly to CORENIAAS.
5. In his contacts with FURNEIRIAL and FURNEIRIAL-1, CORENIAAS will naturally
not disclose a greater knowledge of the DTHOREAS-FURNEIRIAL relationship to
date than would logically be available to him through his own correspondence
with the FURNEIRIAL-1. The FURNEIRIAL-1, DTHOREAS will also be
the FURINOS-C. group, however, the next letter from DTHOREAS to CORE-1AS
will include, in-addition to the letter of introduction, copies of the
FURNEIRIAL-1DTHOREAS correspondence to date. BTHOREAS
correscandere is already available to CORENIAAS, since corries were pooled
to be 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Z Z S S S S S S S S S S1 S1 S S1 S1 SPHcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolorcolor

Dear FUNERIAL:
It is my privilege, by means of this letter, to introduce to you
my good friend, Mr. CORENTIAS, who has recently, and very graciously,
consented to act as the Foundation's personal representative in Chile.
I have taken the liberty of asking Mr. CORENTIAS to serve in this
capacity primarily because this attitudes of our Foundation require that they
seek the responsibility to make the responsibility of the President. We
in which one or more Foundation grants my be cperative. In addition, however,
I earnestly believe this arrangement will serve to strengthen the very promising
relationship already established between us and to stimulate those activities
which are of mutual interest to us. I had not mentioned this stipulation in
the next year. It was a very successful one of the possible imminance
of a formal agreement between prograndia for Chile and the Foundation. Our
receipt of your promised printing cost estinances would prove the way for approval
and detailed planning of an actual grant of assistance.
It is my hope and expectation that it. CORENTIAS will call upon you in
the near future to present his respects and ours. As our representative he is
authorized and prepared to discuss all ratiers of mutual concern. Mr. CORENTIAS
has been instructed to extend to you, to Sr.
(to whom, I trust, you
will introduce Mr. CORENTIAS), and to your work as a whole, every possible courtesy
and assistance. It is my sincere desire that this personal contact will prove
to be of us.
Enclosed you will find a copy of my letter of this date, to Mr. CORENTIAS.
At the sane time, I an sending Mr. CORENTIAS a copy of this letter to you, as well
as copies of our previous correspondence, so that he may familiarize himself with
developments to date.
Trusting that you and Sr.
will receive Mr. CORENTIAS as our
representativo in the same spirit with which he has offered to serve, and hoping
that this arrangement will mark the beginning of a worthwhile and enduring
association, I remain,
Ve-73 curially yours,

PROJECT CULING
Project: FRUOSO-G (PFCROTEL) Amendment No.2.
Type: Operational
I. AUTHORIZATION
A. Basic Program Authorization
1. Basic project PERROVEL was approved on 12 February
1952 for the establishment of a mechanism capable of conducting
KUOGNN activities aimed at the accomplishment of WHD missions
(a) and (b) in Chile; as set out in Section II (paragraph 2 b)
and (c) to the extent that the information is not available.
1951. This task was assigned priority one in Phase I (1 Jan. -
30 June 1952) in the aforementioned plan. Funds in the amount
of $4,700,00 were allotted to this Project, to provide salary
from contract agent Paul D. LANGWIII (PUBLIATOR-1) for the
form order of the project. The project is bringing into PERINES
for a period of covert training, provide this per class allowance
while here, and to transport him back to Santiago, (ville).
following completion of training.
2. Amendment No.1 to basic project PERROVEL was approved
on 14 July 1952 for the amount of $8,000 (later reduced to $3,000)
and $10,000 (later reduced to $2,000) (later, or cost, to contract agent
Paul D. LANGWIII; the loan to be considered to be a necessary
and equipment valued at approximately $10,000; interest and
principal to be amortized at the rate of $500 per month, the full
account of the agent's salary. Authorization for PERROVEL Amend-
ment No.1 was the same as that for the basic project PERROVEL.
3. The 1954 WH Operational Program, approved by Chief,

III. THE PROPOSAL
A. Statement of the Proposal
M. In basic support FERGOTIL, it was proposed to
undertake the development in Gulio of a group or committee
composed of Chilean nationais which would engage overtly and
actively in anti-BCGTPSY efforts and would function as a WID
rechanism for the acceptibent of WID risacions (a) and (b)
aforementioned. As the first stop in implementing the develop-
ment of the proposal, the proposal is to be made to the Board of
of a PERGUE national in Chile as a contract agent whose task
was to select, and exercise subtle guidance over a qualified
Chilcan, the latter to act as the organizer of the caratitee.
It was further stated that at such time as development of the
proposal, the proposal is to be made to the Board of
place the committee in the proper relationship with the
DTHAREAS foundation for purposes of cover and support. The
provisions of the foregoing are now revised in accordance with
the proposal of this amendment as set out below. The overall
objectivity of this amendment is to be made to the Board of
CITIC.
It is proposed, in this Amendment No.2 to Basic
Project FERGOTEL, that WID furnish technical and financial
support, not to exceed $10,000 during Fiscal Year 1954, to an
indigenous group of Chileans for the purpose of adding the
group in its overt anti-BCGTPSY and anti-SIGHT KIAGON-Typo
and anti-BCGTPSY. RD support will be possible to assist
in the re-arrived and the development of which its original lines and
to foster by support periodically advanced, the revival of the
group's official organ, a weekly news magazine. It is antici-
pated that the indigenous group will eventually also serve as
a mechanism for the channeling of WID support to other worthy
groups with similar aims. (Soo Annex C).
B.
Background
The proposed 1957, a Group of Inclinical Chilcan business and
intellectual lesions formed a logically generated organization
dedicated to as overt and active anti-BCGTPSY and anti-BCGTP
program through use of all types of KIAGON media. The group
published an anti-BCGTPSY weekly news magazine designed for
the working class audience. The activities of this group,
including publication of its official organ, were later
supposed as a result of financial difficulties, public solici-
tation and subscriptions being, at the time, the only source of
Fund.

Sensory

Nasion Santiago, working through contract agent Paul D.
LANCEVIN, FUMERIAL, an unmitting Chilean with excellent
contacts in business and intellectual circles, has unaccounted
in re-activating the former organization, and has recently
appreciated DITAREAS with a request for support for the group's
activities.
C. Current Status
1. The provisions of basic project PROGREI and of
Amendment No.1 have been fulfilled. Contract agent Paul D.
LANCEVIN has accomplished his mission, that of collecting and
subly guiding a Chilean citizen as the indigenous organizer
of the committee. The loan to LANESEVIE, provided under the
towns of Amendment No.1, has been paid in full, and the services
of the United agent, for this project, were terminated as of
31 December 1978.
2. The present committee, composed of influential Chilean
citizens, has been in touch with the DITAIEAS foundation since
March, 1953. The initial contact and subsequent correspondence
of the tobacco have been handled by FUMERIAL, who, while not
a member of this group, has been in the same position in
caricaturist and satirati with abundant information in
journalism and publishing, and the has taken upon the initiative
in re-farming the ones-active committee.
3. DITAIEAS is currently awaiting receipt, from FUMERIAL,
of a detailed estinato of financial support needed, to include
printing costs of the group's wockily news magazines. The
FUMERIAL is a member of the FUMERIAL and FUMERIAL-1,
a dynamic anti-BCGGYPSI individual who also published the
official organ of the 1947 organization. Upon receipt of the
abovementioned estimates, and pending thoir roview and approval
by WED, DITAIEAS should be prepared to extend technical and
improvement of the new amount of $10,000 per annum. It
is understood that such WED support is cancelled through DITAIEAS
will supplement at least an equal amount which is to be raised
locally by the FUMERIAL committee.
4. Contract agent Paul D. LANCEVIN has been replaced,
as the cut-out and principal agent for WID, by Staff Agent
in the CREEKINES, The latter is presently being introduced
into the committee, and the committee will be given a
DITAIEAS foundation; this is being done by means of corres-
pondence between DITAIEAS, FUMERIAL, and Tortin J. CREEKINES.
Once WID support to the FUMERIAL group is actually extended
by DITAIEAS; CREEKINES; through the exercise of subtle guidance
made possible by his capacity as a DITAIEAS representative,

will set at least indirect control over the activities
of the group.
D. Advantages to be derived by KUGON
1. S supporting the activities of the MUNSTALL
organizatic; WED will obtain the services of a source
mechanic: unitting of CRYONE interost, capable of conducting
extending the business and business processes. The basis of
2. In addition to execution of its own KUGON type
program, the FUEHRIAL group will serve as the focal point for
Funding and direction of other KUGON activities carried on by
other indigenous groups having similar aims. By extension of
support to other such groups, the FUEHRIAL organisation could
thus become the nucleus of a secure KUGON network, requiring
no direct contact by WED/KUGON personnel under CACID cover.
3. Since this operation would be funded by WHD headp.
quarantees, through the WHD mechanism DTHAERAS, and since control-
will be made, the KUGON system is developed by the KUGON
titative in Chile, Mission Santiago will be relieved of all but a
monitoring and reporting responsibility. This is in accoriance
with the WPD plan of removing direct control of, and attribution
for, KUGON operations from the official station.
E. Risks Involved
Risks involved in establishing the KUGON channels
enviaged in this project should be minimal. The indigenous
individuals concerned have been recruited on an unwitting
basis and will be handled by Martin J. CCKENIAS directly. The
FUEHRIAL group, as an existing legal entity, has good natural
and effective use of the KUGON system. This is a major
vities. No Station personnel will be involved and the possibi-
lity of DUCKES interest being disclosed will be further mini-
mized by securely funding the group and backstopping both
Martin J. CCKENIAS and the group's activities by DTHAERAS.
FUEHRIAL will be unwitting of the original source of his
funds and of DYDER interest.
