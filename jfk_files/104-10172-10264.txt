those defectors for whom we have a legal responsibility should
be watched during the BREZIMEV visit.
The committee staff, SB and CDC had prepared
lists of those defectors and the whom they felt were un-
predictable, unstable and/or violent. The following are the
names of those submitted (including comments made and the
agreed on position the Agency would take up).
A. Antanas SUTKUS (MEMIGLE) was the
only defector listed by the KGB on their
watch list. BUTNUS works for the RFE in

and not likely to cause trouble. His wife

likely to cause trouble. He is a publicized
defector. It was decided as his name
routinely to the Secret Services.

He is stable. No passage.
Q.
TERESILUKOV who works for Radio Liberty.
R. HYZYUK - An oceanographer who came into
the U.S. through the IRC. He works for the Logos
Development Company. He is anti-Agency but very
stable and sober. No passage.
3. Mr. Friedlander and I were in agreement on all the
cases. He backed me up on AELADE, AEDONOR and those other
defectors in whom we had invested large sums of money, time
and effort to conceal.
4. Copies of this memo (with attachments) will be
placed in the 201 files of AELADE, AEDONOR, AELENIS (no
attachments) (AELUSTER) AEGAIN) and AESTUNT!

1. Dr. Charles Bohrer recommends (subject to Howard
Osborne's concurrence) that the two following defectors
be added to the Brezhnev visit watch list:
a. Anatoly COLITZYN (AELAIE). Delusions of
grandeur; expected much more from the U.S. Government than
he in fact received in terms of perscal recognition. Frus-
trated, reclusive. May take some action to "get even."
b. Yuri NOSSENKO (AEDONOR). Not seriously neurotic,
but because of the way in which he was handled he has reason
to be vengeful, and may take the Brezhnev visit as an oppor-
tunity to embarrass us.


14/00/000
1. Howard Osborn's recommendations for the Brezhnev
"watch list":
a. Delete NOSSENKO. He's happily rehabilitated,
well disposed toward CIA and the USG, well adjusted. Not
a threat.
b. GOLENIEWSKI. Absolutely nutty. Put him at
the top of the list. He hates the Soviet Government because
it's depriving him of the Romanov crown jewels.
c. Anatoly GOLITZYN. Agree with Bohrer. Put
him on the list.
