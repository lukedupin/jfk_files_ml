reports, but they appear to have been accurate) reported in
1963. He has been a former president of the American Medical

Communist and a military type in the strictest sense of the

retain him in his present position. CASTRO also is aware
that he has few officers with the military discipline,
know-how, and experience possessed by FERNANDEZ.
