MEMORANDUM
SUBJECT: Activities of Dale SMITH
1. Attached is a newspaper interview with American
Black Power advocate Dale SMITH, which was published in
Sandags Attaelt, 7 July 1968, and which gives a fair des-
cription of SMITH's views as they have been expressed on
other occasions.
2. SMITH mentions a television program which had been
filmed but not shown by Danish TV. The program was, in fact,
shown on the week the interview appeared; the title was "The
Negro in Denmark" and a group of five American Negroes had a
fine time sitting around a table in a dark, smoke-filled set
meant to appear as a cafe, damning white America, capitalism,
Russian communism, and - most emphatically - Denmark, all
with a fine disdain for logio or sequence of thought.
