the Communists from power, A secondary and subordinate
mission is to determine the climate prevailing among the
populace in Havana for organizing resistance elements capable
of either passive or active sabotage. This secondary mission
is to determine the potential of the development of a new
the project. In order to accomplish the foregoing missions,
the operation has been split into two initial phases, which
will be compartmented from each other. Phase One involves
a new process of developing and used 8 on the north coast
of Havana province. These two individuals who
tobacco
Havana for a period of approximately two weeks, and then
exfiltrate black from the same point at which they infiltrated.
Bassing two involving AMICE/27 and AMICE/14, will consist of
farming and water, and the other two individuals will be
of. Matanzas. These two individuals will likewise go into
Havana for a period of several weeks and then exfiltrate black.
These two phases are discussed in detail in following para-
tion. The first part of this section is to be used in the locations
designed to set up infiltration/exfiltration routes and to
make initial contacts among certain select high level military
figures in Havana. The following paragraphs discussing these
phases are not designed to be operational plans. Detailed
operational plans for each phase will be forwarded as de-
veloped.
III. PHASE I.
A. AMTRUNK Personnel
1. AMTRUNK/2 is a [21]year old Cuban who is mature for his
years, and in some degree experienced in clandestine opera-
tions. He attended Catholic Social University in Havana for
two years, majoring in Social Studies. Prior to Fidel's
takeover A/2 was allied to student elements of the Partido
of the American Society. He was a professor of
the revolution against Batista till it beyond the present
Castro had cast his lot for a Communist regime. During his
university years from 1959 to 1961 he was actively engaged
in supporting anti-Castro groups with weapons and materials.
He was a professor of the American Society, a womana
underground were rolled up but A/2 avoided compromise. He
continued in this work through 1961 and finally left Cuba
via air in ganuary 1962. Although A/2 does not consider
the use of a new program, he was a professor of the
histraining. He is a pensive individual who displays good
judgement. His present attitude towards KUBARK appears to
be one of "wait and see". In the meanwhile, he is con-
scientiously applying himself in preparation for his mission.

2.1 AMTRUNK/3, a 22 year old Cuban, in contrast to A/2, is
volatiles, immature and impulsive. On the other hand he is
quite loyal to A/2 and his quick wit is appealing to his
fellow team members. He worked under A/2 in the underground
work of the type, principally engaging in sabotage. His
underground work is a 100% over the 100% over the 100%
when in 1958 he supported the revolution against Batista.
In late 1960 he sided with the counter-revolutionaries and
began full time anti-Castro activities. After the crack
in the first time, he was a 100% over the 100% over the 100%
and continued to engage in underground activities. Finally
when the situation became hopeless he left Cuba by air for
Miami in (August)1962. While A/3 has performed satisfactorily
to
the
1962
of
the
1963
of
the
other
three
members.
A/3
feels
KUBARK
should
on
function as support for this operation and should not inter-
fere in the actual plans of the operation. Fortunately his
role in this operation is comparatively minor and he appears
willing to comply with whatever A/2 decides. Nevertheless,
justi-control of A/3 offers problems in the future.
B.
TASKS
1. Conduct black infiltration landing at Punta La Jijira
(AMS 3785 I) and establish contaçt with the farm manager at
A/3's father's farm in the Galera' section (AMS 3885 III,
Coods 993841. 0%
08
2. Through contacts of A/3 obtain transportation for A/2
to Guanaba or Havana.
08
3. Although not definite, A/3 may remain at his (father's
farm and train assets in maritime reception and clandestine
communications. Having completed this he would then be ex-
filtrated at Punta Jijira.
4. A/2 will go to Havana and obtain safehouse and operational
support through his contacts.
5. A/2 will contact and develop two potential assets with
high level connections within the Rebel Army.
6. A/2 will train support and operational assets in clandes-
tine communications as well as arrange for transportation for
his exfiltration.
7. Exfiltration of A/2 at Punta La Jijira or Puerto Escondido

C. INFIL-EXFIL PLANS
1. The tentative date for the infiltration of A/2 and 3 at
Punta La Jijira is 18 May 1963. The infiltrees will make
their way to A/3's father's farm one kilometer from the coast
and from there A/2 will be provided with transportation to go
to Guanabo, or Havana.
2. The exfiltration of A/3 will occur three days after his
infiltration. This arrangement, as yet, is not definite.
3. The exfiltration of A/2 is tentatively planned for 31
May 1963 at Punta La Jijira or Puerto Escondido. A/3 feels
that Puerto Escondido would afford a more secure point for
exfiltration but that a reconnaissance of the area would be
necessary before final decision is reached. Prearranged
and the removal would indicate his preference.
4. The above grades fall within a favorable moon phase for
maritime operations. In addition the infil-exfil schedule
will allow for an extra margin beyond the 10 days which A/2
considers the minimum acceptable period of time to make his
contacts.
D. OPERATIONAL ASSETS WITHIN CUBA
1. Following the successful infiltration of A/2 and 3 the 24
two men will work their way to agram owned jointly by A/3's
father and Santos SUAREZ located 1 kilometer2) from the point
of infiltration, 26 They will make contact with the manager of

to Guanabo or Havana and safonhouse him. This, however, may
jeopardize the operation because A/3 lacks the maturity and
patience necessary to stay put while A/2 goes about his busi-
ness. He may take advantage of his visit to Havana to under-
take a clandestine assignment on his own. When A/2 and 3
step ashore in Cuba, control will vanish. Fortunately A/2
is a very important of judgement to go about his busi-
ness competently. Unfortunately A/3 gives no such indication.
For this reason an attempt will be made to steer A/3 towards
developing assets around his (rather) farm with maritime
reception capabilities.
A/2, on the other hand, appears to have a sufficient numbe-
tory supporting assets to provide for his? safety while in Havana
However, it is a very broad VALS) and (DUARTE) for over a year. In
addition both men are preferred to the same, the same is
organization and this position may dampen their effectiveness
in recruiting within the Army. Station reports OF DUARTE con-
trol is a part of the situation of 4his man. While there is no
evidence to verify that the U.S. Government is a major
a recent report on him from AMLEO/3 which claims (DUARTE) is an
opportunist who might work for the highest/bidder. (A/2's
rebuttal to these remarks is that DUARTE) has assisted him in
the development of a new program. The continued to aid him
in his underground activities. (This is not a major part of the
mark next to the worth of DUARTE) which unfortunately can only
be resolved by direct contact between him and A/2. There are
a
situations of the state and which should be discussed in this
evaluation. Both A/2 and A/2 is a major part of the issue
- contact in Miami which was to be transmitted by his case
a
contact in Havana. Theer gave an indication that A/2 was seeking
contacts in Havana, and A/2 is a major part of the issue. The
was in the offing. A/2 has written several other letters
not seen by his C Os which might have given the same impres-
sion of on the other hand talked quite freely about his
innovation. (The other hand, the right to do, is a room coming to
Miami and being satehoused. He explained that a new program
AMICE/27 and AMTRUNK/2 on an operation that would take them
first to Miami and the to Cuba. Once there they would go
to the right to do, he was a new program to make contacts. A/3 also
stated that a man nailed (DUARTE) is a major part of the
tacts. This loose talk coupled with A/3's attitude that
KUBARK exists only to serve him makes him a marginal candi-
date for this operation. However, if A/3 is exiltrated
three days after his entry into Cuba, the operation will
gain his usefulness and eliminate some of the risk he
presents.

3 d The above evaluation stresses the operational and security
weaknesses in this operation. In contrast to these weaknesses
are the positive considerations of this mission. A/2 has the
intelligence, competence, and confidence to approach and re-
cruit two assets with the potential for developing anti-regime
operations at a high level within the Cuban Army. The results
are given in the time activities can accomplish is a matter
for conjecture but it is important to carry potential
Nevertheless, if the operation continues, it is not a close
watching in terms of security and control for these factors
will jeopardize the operation as well as KUBARK's position
if not properly contained.

boat onto Cinco Leguas Key (AMS Map 4085 III) to contact
individuals who formerly assisted AMICE/14 in infil-exfil
operations.
2. Through contacts on Cinco Leguas Key, organize a ratline
into the mainland, including making arrangements for trans-
portation into Havana.
3. Through the mechanism established above, move to Havana

4. Make all necessary arrangements for subsequent exfil-
tration and future infiltrations.
5. Approach and recruit two key individuals with contacts
among important military figures.
6. Establish internal and external communications.
7. Exfiltrate from Phase II.
C. INFIL-EXFIL PLANS
It is tentatively planned to infiltrate AMICE/27, AMICE/14,
and AMTRUNK/4 into the Cinco Leguas Keys area on or about
23 April. Subjects will take a small boat with silent motor
into the Keys area and remain in the area for approximately
1000 miles. The which time they will remain black, keep
the boat hidden in the boat. The individual individuals
known to them on Cinco Leguas. They will make the
with contacts at that point to re-activate contacts of AMICE/14
on the mainland at Casualidad (Map 4085 III, Grid Square 1747)
and the boat is located in the Marti and Cardenas. Plans will be
worked out at this time with the boat.
I filtration in the latter part of May. at which time AMICE/27
and AMICE/14 will again go into Cinco Leguas and expect to be
passed on through these contacts to Havana. Subjects will
exfiltrate by small boat on or about 26 April and will be met
with the parent craft in open water to the north of Cayo Cruz
de1 Padre (Map sheet 4085 IV).

g. Target personalities who are suspected of being dis-
affected and on whom A/27 and A/14 will attempt to gather
information in Havana are as follows:
1. Comandante "Macho" Parra
2. Cdte. Oscar Guerra
3. "
Jose Pinares
4. Capt. FNU LAL
5. Capt. FNU LAL
6. Cmdte. Rene de los Santos
7. Capt. Pedro Miret
8. Capt. Juan Nuiry
9. Capt. FNU LAL
10. Capt. Fernando Fernandez Superville
11. Capt. FNU Guerra Matos
12. Capt. Sandy Olivares
13. Yes
These names are all been checked through JMWAVE RI and
in most cases. This with AMLOO3. In a majority of cases
there appears to some evidence to indicate the subjects
may be disaffected. The case of Jose Pinares however,
it would appear that he completely loyal to the regime.
This information was passed on to A/27 and A/14. RI files
were negative on Avila and Lawton.
E. COVER AND COMMUNICATIONS
AMICE/27 and AMICE/14 will live black during their entire stay
in Cuba. They will be equipped with alias documentation and
with disguises. Both of them have previously lived in the
Savana area and know the city well. They will be trained in
the area of new (8%) and will plan to win train at least two and
possible three days. The number of prior to their own
exfiltration. In addition, it is planned to be a new and
A/14 in OWVL. At the time of infiltration, exfiltration plans
are in been laid on with the agents. In the event that a
change in the number of two exfiltration becomes necessary,
an OWVL message could be sent to the party. Any urgent and
immediate message which might have to be sent to the party.
During their short stay in Havana would be on a prearranged
open code system by commercial telegram. Such a system will
be worked out to cover several possible contingencies. In-
ter. communication of whatever net is organized by A/27
and A/14 will be arranged by courier, cut-out, live and dead
drops.
F. OPERATIONAL AND SECURITY EVALUATION
1. The CLFLUTTER examinations on both AMICE/27 and AMICE/14
were inconclusive. Although it is the opinion of both the
case officers and the training personnel who have been in
close contact with these individuals that both agents are
SE I C R E T

- 14 -
highly motivated and strongly anti-communist, this point will
remain basically unresolved since it is almost certain that
A/27 would refuse a second LCFLUTTER examination if asked.
It is believed that A/27 was withholding information during
the LCFLUTTER and subsequently the nature, seriousness, and
possible consequences of this are as yet not clear.
2. A/27 has told at least two people something about this
operation. Although he says that he did not give any details
about his own opinion. He said, he said, he said, he said.
very general terms with two individuals whom he named at
the time of the LCFLUTTER test. One of these is a friend
of Gutierrez Menovo and one a friend of Yargas Gomez.
THELE S.grave
3. AMICE/27 has not seen his contacts in the army for the
past two years. Although it is difficult to assess how well
he knows various persons in the military about whom he speaks,
it is the case officer's opinion that few of these contacts
night be considered really close. AMICE/14 has been out of
three years. This is operational contacts since July 1961.
4. The infiltration of the Cinco Leguas is dependent
upon having a good guide in the United States. At this time, Phase
II is awaiting the recruitment of AMICRUNK/4 as guide.
5. Control over AMICE/27 and AMICE/14 basically lacking.
Some control can be exerted through the implied threat of
withholding support to the operation. Control however will
remain tenuous at best and A/27 will continue to be a dif-
icult handling problem.
6. On the positive side of the ledger is the calibre of the
agents, both of whom are well educated, astute, and highly
motivated. Both agents have experience in clandestine opera-
tions, particularly A/14 who has made a number of previous
clandestine entries and exits and has many operational con-
tacts. To date both have performed in a superior manner in
training.
V. FUTURE PLANS
During the week of 1 through 6 April, the team will receive
maritime instruction. During the week 8 through 13 April,
they will receive SW training, possibly OWVL training, dis-
guise training, and further operational planning sessions.
VI. COMMITMENTS
1. According to AMICE/27, the following principle, which he
feels is a commitment from ODYOKE, was enunciated during his
initial trip to ZRMETAL: "ODYOKE will recognize a new Cuban
SACRE T


15 government which is anti- Communist and which operates on
democratic principles; ODYOKE does not desire to impose a
government of its own choice upon Cuba". A/27 has made a
big point of discussing this "commitment". It is apparent
that he intensely dislikes (or fears?) Batista and his
followers. It is also apparent that in his mind he links
Batista and KUBARK, and fears that KUBARK would back Batis-
tianos in a post-Castro government.
2. All AMTRUNK group members that they received a
commitment while in ZAMBULAL that ODYOKe Would support their
and the local governments, training, logistical support.
and technical assistance, but would leave control of the
operation entirely in their hands. In other words, they
are not working for ODYOKE or KUBARK in any sense. On this
point they are very sensitive.
3. Another commitment which AMICE/27 claims to have discussed
in ZIMETAL is that ODYOKE should give "official recognition"
to the U.S. Government. The U.S. states in a successful
coup d'etat, following the coup, in order that these individual:
will not be treated as political criminals by a future regime.
This means recognition of an individual's participation in
the conspiracy, not a promise of recognition of a specific
government formed by the conspirators themselves.
4. Discussion of the above "commitments" has been pressed
several times by A/27. PEGGINS has not been proposed to these
and the local governments have been lost. It leads that the com-
mitments have already been made by ODYOKE in ZMRETAIL. PEGGINS
has told A/27 that he will report these "commitments" back
to ODYOKE to determine if, in fact, ODYOKE considers them as
commitments.
5. The only commitment made by JMWAVE through PEGGINS has
been that if any of the AMTRUNK group were killed or captured
while on the mission their families in PEPRIIME would be
assisted for a "reasonable" position. The time" financially.
PEGGINS declined back what that the world the would be or how much
than one of the most would be involved.
6. One further negative commitment has been discussed between
PEGGINS and A/27. PEGGINS has stated to A/27 that no com-
mitment will be made at this time to support any internal
group organized by the AMTRUNKS with weapons or explosives
and that this extends specifically to no promise to support
active sabotage with demolitions.
