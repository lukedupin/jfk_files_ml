identify was Col. Konstantin Wakiandrovich BOGATVREY,
the Soviet Military Attache. Someone who the under-

the Soviet Consul, but this certainly was neither
Valentin LOGINOV nor Yuriy CHERNYSI, and the

b. Whether the Cubans were invited or not,
they were not in attendance.
c. Jiri SVESTKA, of the Czech Embassy, was
there. per SB Section briefing, the undersigned
mentioned his departure and told SVESTKA that at
least he would remain in Moxico. SVESTKA said that
he was a very good deal of the meeting. He said
to leave within 15 days for Czechoslovakia. The
undersigned then mentioned a conversation with his
Czech friend in which the latter told him that he
expected to stay in Mexico for quite a while longer.
SVESTKA denied ever having said this, pointing
out that he was glad to return home. The under-
signed made no further comments.

in the background and accompanied the unidentified Tussian during most
of the tour. was introduced to him but little convsation
passed between them. He appeared a little stiff, more the Tussian
sturootype of the reserved, social-ill-act-asse persen. But this
was dusti an impression as FRALE: had not chance for an indepth
conversation. 30LOV.CV seemed to possess decent spälish. He stated
he was from the concrical section. Hopefully subject will attend
other Corps mactings and will have an opportunity to speak

and that she recognized L-1 by his voice from. calling for LOG. (HOES: L-1.
feels positive that at least 4 months have passed since a busan answered
the phone when he asked for LCO).

In the begnning of the conv. L-1 found out that the girl was
from Mowow which certainly pleased L-1 because he had whet to talk about.
She. accomplished L-1 for speaking Russian without an accent, which was
not the case with L-1s bother, the language teacher at the Sov Hmb.

name and whether she is married or not. L-1 should also mention to 100
the fact that he met Alla while waiting for him. Depending on the find-
ings L-1 should consider inviting Alla to his house for lunch one Sat
or Sun and take her with his wife and child to the Parque Asturiano to
spend the afternoon. I told L-1 that I would pay for the expenses for
lunch and possible entertainment. L-1 will discuss the matter with me
before doing anything.
11.
L-1 reported that he had a 90 minutes talk with Karel WENDEL
(see Attachment) and I debriefed him on the same. There were very few
facts which were not covered in the previous report on WENIEL.
12.
As it became obvious that the working part of the meet was over
L-1 stated that he would really feel bad and blow off his top in if he
did not see XARTASUK until the end of the month. I told him that KARATA'SUK
had put'long period of work in the States and consequently his leave was
extended for the same amount of time and x can spend that time where he
pleased. L-1 commented that in that case he would extend the deadline of
becoming nasty to Aug 20. I laughed. L-1 commented that probably I was
not able to understand how much he was attached to KARTASUK.

people decided to give or not to give the directory to him for
passing it LOG. P told Subject that he messed the matter by bringing

that one of them is owner of a mining corporation and the otherone.
is from the Beneficiary ( if remembered correctly) Insurance Co. He
believes that they were satisfied with the findings but it will take
about a month before the deal materializes, because the approval of

9.
Subject showed to F a calling card of I.r. C. Lester NCGee

Subject told him that Lexico had no platinum and that once the Sows
were trying to sell's quantity in Mexico. Mr. Nacgee told Subject
to look into the matter and explained him the mechanic of the deal.
Sove would have to make a firm offer to a Swiss Company which is
controlled by a Canadian company which is in fact a subsidiary of
an American company ultimate destination of the platinum is the
U.S. Reportedly, the deal is all the way through a clean legal
commercial transaction and terms of payment would be Irrevocable,
Confirmed Leader of Credit, cast on delivery in Stitterrinald. The
initial purchase would be 5,000 ounces but there is rill to buy up

be authorized to close the deal. Subject agreed to emphasize the
attractiveness of the commission end the advantage of the fact that
the deal is handled in Switzerland and consequently the commission
is also paid there. F told Subject that he wanted to knor in detail
LOGS reaction concerning the comizicon. Subject should also play
around with the theme that it would be adcal if LCC could trevel to
Switzerland to introduce him to the right person (Sov) and similar.
11.
Subject commented that the buyer is serious and it remains to
be seen are the Soy willing to sell at a convenient for them but still
fair price. Subject went on to say that if the deal was to go well
he would have to go to Switzerland, and this arises another problem,
i.e. how long would it take the his in to get, American Passport, because

to start thinking about passing thet bridge when he comes to it.
12.
Subject appeared to be satisfied with Pa attitude in the above
converzation and he contenated that with this matter shoring up plus
the tennis hat and the written report there should be enough for a meet
with LCG. F told Subject that he wanted a carbon copy of the report

13.
Then, Subject observed that in order to place the business
talk with LOG in the right prospective he would have to see LCG before
Er. 1c®ee and the compenien leave, whin means the latest on Tied noon.
F told him to go ahead and make arrangements which would be normal
if he was trying to push the plittamun deal, but if he gete to see
LOG before Thur at his (Josephinee) apt; he should edvise? by phone,
i.e. leave a message for F to ring him up.
14.
Comment by Fernald:
b. Even if nothing comea out of the platinus deal,
which is quite likely, conversation about it
and the associated commission, should give us
some reading on LCG on one hand and on the other
shed more light ca the personal relation between
Subject and LCT.
E. The ne call : social relation between
and 1007 is intenriti to on the lest.

Subject: Valention LOGIOV - Bio Sketch by LITACON-1
Remarks:
1.
Concerning the preblens which Log has with his colleagues
LIMACON-1 was not able to offer specific examples. In at least 3
instances LOG spoke to L-1 that the peyehelcgical atmosphere within
the Sov Embassy is horrible and depressing. LIG stated that there was
not a single person in the Embassy in which one can confide: everybody
is ready to cut othersnes throat just to advance; if there is nothing
the colleagues can pin agen:st a person they start intriguing tophing
that one might lose his temper and comait something stupid which
would be sufficient to herm the person involved: if ones aks: for
advise he would in no time find out that he was considered inceaprent.
In Fall 1962 L-1 invited LCG to attend a party and told his
tiat Yurly CHEENISH (P-13,042) would be there. LGG stated that he
would not come, because it would mean or getting himself in trouble
or getting CIEENISH in trouble; to keep any from Sov colleagues is
the only of keeping out of troubles, concluded LCG.
2.
With regard to the statement that LCG was committing errors
by exerting pressure on other people L-1 stated that he reported
LOGS renewed attempt to recruit Miguel Angel. In doing eo LCG abandoned
his tact and ignored the sensitivity of the other person; LCG talk
to L-L in Cuautla tock place in less than a month from LOGE pitch to
Miguel Angel: the way LCG spoks to L-1 made it evident that LCG dis-
regaried ops security rules. Such things did not happen before and
L-1 concluded that LCG test all out to sotiles soue siccees before
he loavee ESS. "cost what: it nay"
7.
When L-1 stated that he believed that LCG would be a good
person under normal conditions, he meant that he believed that LCG is
tascially a good person and would be acting and theaving ns a good
precon in his normal environment, i.e., if he recained as a unik on
the farm, or he was a tractor driver or a truck driver and seltler,
because in such conditions LCG could do a good job and roul! cost
tave to depend on rezal expailility which be done not have.

L-1 does not know why LOG expresses such a great love and adri-
miration for Spain and Spaniards. L-1 fecis positive that; LOG was
never in Spain; he has nc reason to believe that LOG did any extensive
reading about Spain; in fact L-1 believes that LOG knows about Spain
what he teard from Spaniards into 11eve in the USSE and, apparently,
he was associating with a sumber of them in Moscow.

Valentin LCGINOV
Edad aproximada de 43-45 años, aunque apareita menos. Fisicamente
de complexion atletica, alto. Juega muy bien al tenis. Recientemente
quedo en segundo lugar en el campeonato del D.F. que tuvo lugar
en el Clué francia, donde practica este deporte. Cuida muchísimo
su condicion física y más que nada su apariencia. En este sentido
es muy vanidosu. Muy pocos amigos saben que tiene una hija de
16-17 años. Cuando le preguntan si tiene hijos hable solo de su
hijo de 11 años de edad. Le da pena presentar a su mujer, que es
muy amable y buena, porque se ve de más edad que él. No fuma, toma
ciguitar
muy poco, aunque cuando la ocasión requiere de tomar mucho agocienti
y siempre se le ve sereno. Es muy amable en el trato. Nunca trata
de imponer sus ideas, pero siempre pendiente de convencer por las
vóre
buenas a sus contrinantes: Cuando ve que no puede hacer lo último,
rompe diplomaticamente los relaciones asistosas con el sujeto.
En sus ideas es de la escuela estalinista: solo cuenta lo Uñon
Sovietica y la última línea a seguir del Partido. Eso quiere decir
que no tiene ideas propias. Sigue ridelisinamente la "línea" porque
sabe muy bien que es la, única forma rápida y eficaz de escalar en-
su carrera. Le- gusta muchísimo la vida buena, tipo occidental,
aunque antes se dejaría cortir un brazo que confesárselo así mismo.
Es muy anbicioso y se ve que tiene problemas con sus compañeros de
trabajo. Habla despectivamente de ellos. No le! gusta nada la idea
fis
de teané que permanecer en 'Nscd los dos años que vienen. 203 dijo
que haría lo posible que al transcurrir esos años lo mandaran de
preferencia otra vez a México. Su ilusion más grande es trabajar
en España. Adora a los españoles. La forma de ser de los rejicanos
no le gusta. Por eso si quiere regresar, quiere decir que prefiere
cualquier lugar donde vivir, menos Rusia. Creo que precisamente

porque ya tiene que partir en julio, es por lo que ultinamente esta
cometiendo errores. Quiere hacer verit os a como de lugar, presionando
a la gente de que antes jams hacía. El dia 3 de mayo lo vi
en Cualabla, y sabiendo que yo no quiero trabajar para él, me
crano
insistió, llegando al coéceño de preguntar si podíamos abordar a
mi alunno John, sin siguiera preguntar por la personalidad y forma de
pensar de John: En los 15 miautos que estuvimos juntos no háblo hás
que de eso. Cuando yo. le dije que ya le había dicho antes que no
me gustaba esa clase de trabajo, ne contestó que él creía que lo
que me pasaba es que tenía miedo. La forma mis inocente de hacerme
picar! A continuación, me invitó a comer el día 8 para seguir
hablando de. lo mismo: En el fondo creo que todo eso revela cierta
inconecía y muchas ganas de progresar, para llevar una vida muy
diferente a lo que llevan los ciudadanos soviéticos. Creo que
quiere dejar una grand impresión a sus. jefes para no quedar trabajando
indefinidamente en el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Moscd.
No se hasta que punto sus ambiciones puedan quiarlo. a progresar
incluso por medio de atropellar víctimas. Como persona y en condiciones
normales me parece bueno, géneroso y fiel amigo. Sin embargo la
verdad es que nunca lo llegue a conocer muy bien, en parte posiblemente
porque casi desde el principio sentía instintivamente que quería
algo de n:, muy sarte de nuestra amistad y en parte porque con todo
y la confianza que llego a tener conmigo jamás se descubrió por
completo, ni mucho menos. Es extrenidamente caiteloso.
Rafundendo: 11 impresión es qué es una buena persona, de buconos
sontimientos, pero que una vez -etido en "ese trabajo," por razones
que desconoceros, hace todo lo posible por destacas.

Subject irmedistely reeked what was the decision concerning the
Emb directory which LOCIOVWAS asking for.? told Subject that the directory
was his least worry end that he would like to hear how did the things go
with ICCIIOV. Subject etarted speaking about the meet (see separate Attech.
By the time Subject was through with his description of the neet,? obtained
they
a more convenient table and as we moved to it.? requested Subject to write

write the chroco sequence of his contacts with LOCIOW which Subject did
by looking in his egende and he did it 'itcut hesitation.

and told Subject that acceriting to the price :erege he left for 7 it
appeared that LCG did not come to the neet scheduled for June 25 end
not as he put it on paper. Subject repeated what he wrote and confirmed
that on June 20 Subject did not show up and on June 25 LCG discuss came
and Subject did not show up ( LIGERRAE surveillance confirmed the latter
statement). 7 observed that on his first meet with Subject on June 23
Subject said that he had a meet with LOG on June 25 and told him that he
had no time to try to get the directory. Subject showed no embarrassment
and ho told F that he must have cieeundertood Subject's statement.
5.
F told Subject that he did not follow F's instruction in speaking
to LCG shout the directory, specifically, by bringing up a name of
Patricis which created a problem without which he would be much better
off. The face: in that Subject works noddy in the U.S. Embassy. Subject
was of the opinion that we can always introduce him to a person in the
Zab who can play the role of bring his acquaintance. 7 told Subject that
we were not can's pulling rabbits out of a hat and all our actions were
conducted within limits of security. That Subject was suggesting was a
complete direçerd for oir as well his own security and the beet thing
he can tell LOG on their next nest was that "Patricia" did not show up
as yet.
6.
It may be noted that 55 attempt to debrief Subject on what
transpired at each of his mets with LCG did not tear deozired results.
Subject stated the facts he mectiond to? on their first meet and started
repeating himself as he was going on. Therefore, F decided to get as de-
tailed as possible description c: the last meet and Subject was cooperative.
Although, Subject spoke about the last meet at the evening of our meet
he did not aind trying putting it in sequence as it took place. From what
Subject stated Previous mests it may be worthwhile noting that Subject
had a party at his apt on June 10 and he asked LCG to come to the party.
LGO explained Subject that he did not like to be seen in large groups
and he sent Subject 2 bothen of Votka for the party. Subject also
stated that in 3 - 3 instances he prozised LCG to bring his a tennia
het?roe the U.S. actually, LCG would like to have 2 tennis hata, one
with a viner and the other tue with a rig around, sime large. Subject

Subject in case there was something like that.
8.
After covering the ground as contained in the 3 attachments
F asked Subject was he willing to back nis statemente with a polgrapn
test (? used the expression 'lie detector teet' ). Subject reacted by
asking when did we want him to take the test.? commented that he did
not say that Subject would be given one, he only asked would he be willing
to take one, if we seked him to do it. Subject stated that he was willing
to take the teat at any time. Then, he started asking questions about
the test, especially, who usually gets it and how it works. With regard
to who gets F stated that anyone involved in matters having hearing on
the security of the U.S. and es to how it vorks, there is nothing to it:
it registeres when a person says a lie es the starch digests automatically
anything a peronae eata.

Comment by FERIALD:
e. This meet enables us to have a better insight of
Subject's personality.
b. There are valid indicatione that Subject is not
withholding important info concerning his personal
history nor his activity.
c.Hic claim to have numerous and to an extaction influent-
ial contacts appear to be acceptable.
d. The question of what is to be, but hae a tendancy to
deviate from the instruction given to him concerning
his attitude toward (oricr). It is possible that thin
is due to his conviction that he knowe 10 better than
we do and that we are too degrastic and not enough
flexible. At the same time, the question of what fact
is that the question is exactly for the eako of
pleasure he cote out of the gene be such on one hand
and on 10 other, he might fear that our
of action my ultimate L: from is, 1- which cases
he could be let' without a cee:

160 - 8911
1.
Arragreement's for this sent were made through the office and
the fact that the phone which Subject left with cur office was out of
order made it necessary that BIERHALD call on Subject at his apt. It
be noted that Subject is in the process of neving and the only furniture
in the living room of the above mentioned apt consisted of two beaten up
easy chers w/o arm rest and a sort of an end table loaded with papers and
a telephone; another phone was on the floor in the corner of the roos.
There was co much dust on the floor that it is difficult to believe that
the apt was in any ure during the lest 10 days.
2.
Subject NEW ADDRESS: Leibutts 297 apt 7 phone 31-53-93
Office: Precociendoors de Bejio, Inseurgente Sur 429 office 12
(first floor), phone 64-63-47.
Subject can be reached home until 0930 in the morning and in the office
between 1100 and 1400 hrs and in the afternoon between 1700 and 2000 hrs.
Subject stated that it would be rether difficult to find hin in his
office because of his frequent "in and out" work.
3.
COMMO with us: Subject was told that once he has placed in
contact with the "proper people" he should use from now on the extenition
£70. He will identify himself as Sr. AVVIZO ( allegedly his mothers feafi-
nacn ) and will aske for Sr. Virgil (FALDTHI) FRAHALD alisa.
4.
FERNALD showed Subject his official loozing credentiale tender-
alian of Virgil 2. BALDINI and after he read them quite cerefully,
stated that now Subject knew that he was speaking to the right person
Subject: commented that he was satisfied with 75 tona fide.
5.
F first asked Subject few. personal questions: the phone is out
of order because he requested that it be tracfered to his new apt and
en Saturday (June 21 when he en that the phone was not in operation to
called "hin friend Cerloo 2000000 to put preceure on the Telephone
but nothing could be done in view of the reek-end: the elevator in the

building is often out of crder, because there are too many children in
the building; Subject is morrid and has 2 children, but he is precently
separated from his wife; as the children finished the lich School his wife
wanted then to continue their chooling in the U.E.; Subject avoided
specifying what school his children attended here and called the school
"the American High School: Subject has been in Lexico 4 years and his
wife only 2 yeers; as much as he love. Lexico so much his wife did not get
used to Lexico and 6id not want to renzin any longer here; the fact that
he did not want to leave Lexico resulted in their physical separation;
according to Subject it is only a matter of daye that his family left for
San Jose, California, which Subject called his home town; Subject claims
that his family ( peternal side ) comes from Milan, Italy; his great grand
father came to New York, NY, and followed the gold rush to California where
he apparently did well; for reasons unknown to Subject his grand father
moved from California to Arizona and then to Mexico (Sinaleo) where
Subjects father was born; in the same breath Subject stated that he, too,
was born in Lexico and when 2 commented that it would be logical that he
have a dual citizenship, Subject did quite bit of talking to confuse the
the previous statement; during the revolution all the records were burned
and he has only the certificate of taptism inued by a Lexican church and
in fact it was possible that he was born on the U.S. side of the brder;
Subject claims he could not care less about the possibility of claiming
Mexican citizenship, he is an American and it suite him well to live in
this country as a TOURISER; in the Praccionadore de Pafijo he works with
a partner, who entered the company as owner of 2 large chunks of land;
Subject had no money but he is the person who through his connectione
obtained from a Lexicen bank a decision that the bank would mortgage
up to 50 per cent every structure he and his partnex complete; now he
is in the stage of obtaining American investment capital to carry out
the construction of low income housing (2 does not recall the location
Subject centioned); of course Subject went through financial difficulties
and is still facing some of them, but nothing serious; He has a car of
his own; he is roving out of this apt and will sub-let it and make few
hundred peson per centh on the difference of precent price and what he
is paying; this type of transactione cannot get hin in troubles, because
exicans do not care about rich things; he has a friend in the Gcernnacion

the cence shoneel him that the Schormeccion bed nore then a foot high
file on him end Subject told him they should not bother trying to do
something against him heceure they cencot even kick him out of the country:
he has a friend to whom he is amitharised to turn if he is in any kind of
trouble and he casked his Coterenaction to dial the phone which he gave him
and the phone was anreversed by CIEINLROS of the Presidency: Subject claims
that he has influenial friendis in practically every niristry (Secretaria)
of the Federal government: Subject also prides himself with women friends
he has and the "falso influciencial.
6.
In answer to 52 question Subject stated that he called on Kr. J.057
at the U.S. Embassy secure he he had a fairly close relation with Valentin
LOCIHOV (P-11,712) of the Soviet Embassy and he would not want to be
judged wrongly if the NOVIRI people get to know about his friendly relation
with LOCIHOV.
7.
P commented that he hoped that Subject realized that the title
on his credentials really spells Counter Intellisence, which, for example,
means that if P. saw Subject robbing a bank he could' not care less because
that would be the matter concerning the criminal police, or if was charged
for having a child out of woldock, because that would be a matter for
the judiciary authority, but when it comes to epies than that is a matter
which concerns F and the service he is working for. In view of the
well established fact that LOCIHOV is a spy and Subject is his friend (sic)
this matter is of concern for the American Counter Intelligence. Therefore,
would appreciate if Subject st.tied clearly what was the purpese of his
visit to the U.S. Embassy. Subject answered without hesitation nor
embarrassment that he believed that he made himself clear even at the
Embassy that he wanted to cooperate with the U.S. Service and be of help
as much as it stood in his power. F commented that he would probably ask
Subject does he still want to help the U.S. Counter Intelligence before
we cloce our meet today.
8.
In reply to Je questions Subject stated:
in February 1969
a. He not LOCIHOV at a social party in the house of
Cable
Dr. Fraderico AIN, who is as is comsently known a
Communist by his Ideology. He does not know wert there
other Soviet officials at the party. LOCIHOV first

spoke to Subject in a heavy accented broken English
and was delighted then Subject requested that they
speak Spanish. LOGINOVB general line of conv was that
the essential thing in the life in understanding and
to be able to understand others one must get to know
them; this in turn calle for having as many friends
as possible. The same applies to countries and nations.
Before leaving the party LOGINOV stated that he would
like to become friendly with Subject and asked him
would he be willing to meet with him. Subject agreed
and they met next Friday at the Tecali Restaurant.
b. The conv at the Tecali was to an extent dealing with
the theme of friendship and understanding with an
added emphasis that if there was understanding and,
consequently, friendship between the U.S. and Soviet
Union we would be living in a much better world.
Subject stated his agreement with LOGINOV was interested in
further part of the conv LOGINOV was interested in
knowing whether Subject had many friends in Mexico'
Subject claims to have stated that he had many good
friends here. (NOT3: It is quite likely that he
bragged about the number of influential friends he had
here). At the end LOGINOV told Subject that he would
like to see him again and Subject asked him to come
to hie house. According to Subject, LOCINOV asked
would not the fact of receiving a Sov official com-
promise Subject or lend him into some kind of troubles.
Subject assured him that the receiving of a Sov or
any foreign official could not affect him in no way.
Then, LOCINOV asked Subject would they be alone and
Subject answered affirme tively. (Note: At this point
Subject indicated that he received LOCINOV at the
apt et the Icithits 297). Finally, LOCINOV agreed to
come to Subject ept.
c. In the apt LOCINOV did not feel at case for some
tice. Intinily, he did not drink from the Votka which


37
- 5 -
Subject poured end he drank only efter Subject took
a Bip out of LGO'c class ( Search: This certainly sound
exaggerated). Turing the evening LOE was repeatedly
specking about his need to have friende: make new
new fricendhipe and was polating cut that Subject
was able to help in that respect. Subject stated to
that he offered to LOC to introduce him to any friend
of his he wished. In the course of cony LOG was asking
Subject verions questions concerning polities, ecconcy
and trade in Mexico and Subject was ansurcing with
degree of familiarity with topise: leg felt that
Subject was well informed and he asked him how come
that he was so well informed, is he perhaps a TOFIE
man. Subject loughed at the question and added that
in fact be hated TOFIRI and everything associated with
it. LOO gave Subject his phone & eggarettly the callin
card) and told Subject that the would not be phoning
to him and that it was better if they egreed in ad-
vance when and where they would meet next.
d. From this point Subject gave up describing cimenicolor
gically the developments. He stated that there were
about 10 additional mestn with LOG. The place they
used most extensively was the La Cava. They usually
were neeting at 2000 hre, i.e. the time when the
restaurants have the minimum of guests. Subject belier
that LOG started using Le Cava more frequently for
their meet because of the fact that the tecail
e. Subject stinted that out of pure ouricstty he other
LOG coming to their meeting place: 100 leave his
car 5 - 7 block way from the place, boards a sue,
nets out a block beyond the getting place and come
walking alorly and making occasional steps to observe
whether he was followed. Then they get in a reiterum
togetherives a good look to every person in the
restaurant and reaisa especially watchful if he ret
two men together.

f. Subject stated that the leitootif of LOG curing thone
seets was "helpno and I will be ohe to help you".
"get me (or provide no with) the info I need and Iwill
provide you with info you might need". Among the most
saujut info by LOG was personality info on Mexican
politicians and, especially, indications are to who
will te the next Prenident of Mexico, LOG is very
such interested does
to become the next President than
Later it became an ohesation to find out what
REAL reeson for Rockefellera trip to the countries.
LOG discounted the fact-finding as any reason, because,
according to him the U.S. embasies and the GIA in
those countries know everything that is to be known
Consequently, LOG in convinced that there nunt an
important reason for ROCETETrip. Subject added that
there very many other rinor questions concerning the
Mexican scene which interested LOG and to a fair
extent he was able to get the ennvers. Nevertheless,
LOG started asking Subject did ho have friende in the
U.S. Embassy here. Subject was answering cazeully
with an "of course". On the neet Subject had with
LOG on June 9 at la Cava LOG told him that he needed
an Embassy phone directory and te asked Subject can
he get him one. Subject prosided to try. LOG brought
to Subject's attention that he needed the "new directory
because the Euteasy changes the directory every six
nonthes.
E. In reply to 7E question Subject ratted that
his that be needed all the info he was asking for to
advance politically in bir career on one hand and on
the other to dispeil misunderatending to which the
lack of info may ceelly lead.
b. With record to LCG Subject described him as a Itcshle
person with quite liberal view on international po-
lities; he prsionately hatea Truehchor and is

decply concornnd over the deager Red China represente
to the rorld; he avocuente the U.S and Sev Union
Ghenzdrigin a rutunl defence fact and liquidate the
Chica until there is still time; he believes that
Sev Union and the E.S. are entitled to act in: desere
of their own interests and "so hell with that the
rest of the world nyses's he acnire the deternination
and Gnerisas of Amorione.
9.
After getting through the portion F told thes he still
feel that the should ret and give 100 the Emb. Hione Directory. to stated
that he was willing to do must we tell him to do, but he believed that
if he came to the need with 100 on june 25 without the directory, 100
would consider him as worthless, rince was not able to obtain something
which ho can get in some other way. When P. commented that the directory was
a. tightly controled matter and to get one would practically mean to suipe
one from sonehodyde desk. Subject stated that he vas convinced that 100.
would not care: for a directory which no. nolo, becuse: he. ie interested
in Subject having a friend in the anbany throua rhon he would have
access to info, and presenting the directory would be an indication that
Subject had a friend there.
10.
When Subject reficied negatively to a theoretical possibility of
obtaining a directory "le(s)ly", F told him that he must necessarily be
aware of the fact that 100 rould not be satisfied -ith a statement that
he obtained the directory from a woman or man friend; 100 would insist
in moving the hars and the redres of the person who is his fereng.
Subject pretended not to be conviced about this but did not try to
arcie about it.
11.
Then T told. butes the other he edita/it to himself or not
that he ves trying to anenuvre himself into was a double agent role rich
is by no means an envious role. A person who is offering his cooperation
to the U.S. under such conditions should be aarse that every piece of
info- passed to the opposition, in this case 100, must be cleared and
approved by an U.S. officer which, if nothing else, is a tire consirizg
proposition. Subject selling sed "tice is money". 100 :cented that
only productively uced time is money.

In a heavy and acrioun tene P stated that ho must ank now Subject
whether after the explanation he gave he is still willing to cooperate
with: the U.S. Service under the condition that he would. follow our
instruction and guidance without any reserve. Subject aavered YRS and
added that he was ready and willing to do wistover we toll hin to do.
13.
3 saked Subject did 100 tell his then to me levive
Subject etetid than 100 did not reticne his departure and Subject felt
certain that there was no irrediate departure in sight.
14.
P told Subject that he could next think this metter over and
cincume it with come of his collenges and, therefore, would like to
ceen him tomorrow. Subject atted that he would* busy in the morning and
when I asked him what about the afternoon, Subject asked what about
heving a lunch together. F segred and picked up 52P-Darie as the place
end it was agreed that they would. next in the restaurant at 1400 hra.
15.
F
feola that Subject is a. sort of a Soldier of Zortune, a pleases
end long talker; among his Mexican conteste not mentioned evi- the above
are D.Figniere and Aunestin PERTIOS Gomez. To impress F with closenees
of his relations with MAREOS Gomez, Subject bronsd F ASH annual pors
for all the movie houres in torn and added that A2G gave hir the pace.
This fact eight be interesting but it does not diepell the temptation
to consider Subject to be a. nere dropper.
Bruce 2. Fernald
P.S. Subject mentioned that that gave him some evier and votka. 3 comments
ed that subject should not be surpelled if 7 told him, that we knew
about it.

MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: James SABORI
1. At 1300 hours on 20 June Subject, on the recommendation
of Bob JOHNSON (formerly with INIGO in Guadalajara), came to the
Embassy and contacted COS. Subject apparently has known JOHNSON
and had asked JOHNSON to whom he could talk in the Embassy about
a delicate matter. JOHNSON had recommended COS, identifying him
only as a First Secretary.
2. Subject identified himself as an insurance salesman who
is in Mexico as a tourist and who apparently hopes to do some.
business here. He is of Italian origin and apparently has lived
in Texas and California. At the present time, he is living at
Bahia de Santa Barbara #20, apartment 308. Telephone number is
31-53-1-97.
2. Subject's story was that he has been in contact with
Valentin LOGINOV (P-11/12) (he showed COS LOGINOV's card) and,
as a matter of fact, has had no less than 12 contacts with him.
He is scheduled to have dinner with LOGINOV tonight (20 June) at
2000 hours but he would not say where as he was afraid that COS
would contact the CIA people and surveil him. He is a leader of the
to have dinner with LOGINOV 26 June. He is, they have
had died of a new job. He was a member of the other. Tecali Restaurant.
4. Subject refused to say very much about the nature of his
contact with LOGINOV. His reason for contacting COS was to get a
copy of the latest Embassy phone directory, which LOGINOV had
asked him for. He wanted to bring it to LOGINOV so that LOGINOV
would do things for him. He said he was a member of the other.
He said he was a member of that LOGINOV had invited him to visit the
Soviet Union, LOGINOV has also given him several bottles of vodka.
He was not worried about what LOGINOV could get out of him because,
after all, he was just an insurance salesman. In other words, he
said he was a member of that LOGINOV. He was a member of the
particularly ready to cooperate with us. COS said that he would
have to contact the "proper people" to see about the phone book.
Subject asked COS to do that and said that he would call cos at
1800 hours on 20 June to get the answer. He also said that if the
"proper people" were interested, they could contact him at she
address and phone number given above.


24
- 2 -
5. When Subject calls at 1800 hours, he will be told that
COS has gotten in touch with the "proper people" and that a
representative of these people will call Subject on 23 June. As
for the phone book, COS will say that this is entirely out of
his hands and that the man who contacts Subject on 23 June. will
presumably deal with that.
6. My plan at present is to have Bruce H. FERNALD (P) call
Subject on 23 June and attempt to get as much of r debriefing as
possible without being hostile or aggressive. I am looking at the
long-range possibilities here because, unless the person is
developments, the other people are not the same against LOGINOV.
The subject has really been cultivated so assiduously by
LOGINOV, the chances are that LOGINOV will turn him over to his
successor, assuming that Subject continues to show the promise that
he has apparently showi thus far.
7. The subject has already been the right for frightening Subject away from
LOGINOV or ruining the possibility of future cooperation against
LOGINOV's successor. As for the phone book, I have no intention of
passing it, at least without knowing a lot more than 100%.
On, Subject can be published in the American NewsV. that this is a
one of the most political action and that it will not be very easy to
come by (that is, unless he manages to steal one on his own). Also,
if Subject (who is, at least to our current knowledge, unwitting of
COS' affiliation) mentions COS' name to LOGINOV, LOGINOV's appetite
may be greatly wetted to find out that his new contact has gone
right to the top.
7. There are no Station traces on Subject.
8. Subject called at 1800 hours 20 June. He was given the
message in paragraph 5 and agreed to await a call from "the proper
people" at 0900 hours on 23 June. He also agreed to stall on the
phone book.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: LINEALM-1 CONTACT WITH ADELEHARD
1. The attached report from LIREALM-1 was received on 16 June 1969.
LIREALM-1 verbally added the following comments to the information in the report:
a. Although they have it attended any social functions together
since their lost encounter, it is LINEALM-1's opinion that ADEHARD is
generally avoiding direct contact with him. Only once since LIREALM-1 told
ADEHARD that he was insuclved by :EDIEHARD's request that LIREALM-1 work
for him had ADEHARD asked LINEALM-1 to play tennis, LIREALM-1 has seen
ADDITION on verious occasions at the French Club, but neither have cade any
effort to make it.
b. ADEHARD requested permission to bring a Mancen couple to
the 21 June awards dinner. This was a strange request since the party was
intended to include only those who had participated in the tennis tournament
at the Club. Permission was granted, however, and LIREALM-1 will attempt to
determine the identity of the flexicon couple at the party.
c. Both LIREALM-1 and his wife are convinced that ADEHARD is
avoiding introducing his Soviet friend to the friends of LIREALM-1's wife.
She has placed herself in a position, on a couple of occasions, where ADEHARD
had to be almost impolite in not introducing his friend to LIREALM-1's wife,
but he has chosen not to do so.
2. Based on the instructions given LIREALM-1 after the last incident
between him and ADEHARD, he has not gone out of his way to engage ADEHARD
deconstruction of cultivate his socially. This night explain ADEHARD's
standing of a business and/or his apparent un.illingness to introduce his new friend.
Nore Information on this subject will be available after the 21 June dinner.

1. As arranred last month, 1 picked subject up on the corner

Tastee Freeze in Polance for coffes ant not until 1300. Next
meeting 111 be on 9 July at 1100, same pick-up place.
2. Subject seems like a real diamond in the rough with
earthy and anisible philosophy. I was surprised at this proaptness
and the fact that he doesn't forget meeting datos, even though
they're arranged a month ahoad and there's no confirmation. He told
me that he frequently gives away conly and stuff to the little Sov
kids who come in, feeling that they'11 remember it years from now
when they'r? fed a line of progranda about the West and that this
will make on impression and holp offset all the bad things they
hear.

Subject: LIBACON-1 (P-4805)
Date of Keet: May 21 at the Paris-Kexico Restaurant
1.
This meet was held in tieu of the one scheduled for May 14
which L-1 postponed by phone. L-1 was at the pick up place 10 minutes
before the scheduled time but I was there still earlier and I observed
nothing suspicious in terms of stakouts or surveillance. The meet lasted
75 min. NEXT MEET: Wednesday May 28 at the same pick up place.
2.
As we reat L-1 stated that he cancelled the last week meet
because he was seized by one of his nervous crisic of hysteria followed
by depression (sic). He immediately added that he prepared for me nothing
because in his condition he was not able to do any work.
3.
In the restaurant he kept on describing what effect the nervous
crisis has on him and he added that he still felt depressed. During his
description he did not indulge in dramstizing the matter.
4.
I asked him what happened to the lunch he was supposed to have
with LOCINOV and he repeated what he told me by phone on Kay 8 and added
that LOCINOV was to call him but did not do it. He added that if LOCINOV
had called during the past 8 days the phone would be, answered only if
his wife was home. I told him that this fact was a reason for him to
ring up LOCINOV, because, as we discused and agreed on the last meet,
it would serve no good purpose to L-1 if LOCINOV would characterize him
as a not desirable person from the Sov point of view. He commented that
be believed LOCINOV was a friend of his to the extent that he would not
do such a thing to him. I countered by stating that he insisted in con-
siderning LOCINOV to be his friend, but what ever LOCINOV asked from
his he turned him down with a NO; to preserve good will of a person it
is necessary to meet some of his requests and the best is to do it when
it does no harm to anybody and at the eame time does not set L-1 in-
volved in any of LOCINOVO sechees. He agreed with my reasoning, as he
did at the last meet but it is to be seen what will he do about it.
5.
To change the subject I needed L-1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.11

he knew nothing about VENNEL, except, that hie wife gave a birth to a
child during his absence and he added that if VENNEL had returned he
would had heard about it.
6.
Speaking about Farel he recalled the fact that Cerols HIRSH,
an: Ecuadorian girl of 22 approx. returned to Nexico and she will be
taking an. inteceive course of Russian from L-1. He stated that he spoke
to KARTASUK about this girl: she was here and worked with the Olympic
committee as an interpreter; and the Olympics she went to Ecuador and
now she returned here; she came with her mother who found her an apcrtuant
in Rio Elba where they had d'working up party on Friday key 9; her
father is a well to do physician in Quito, Ecuador; she has no permit
to work in Kexico which means that her father will pay the expenses of
her stay here; in view of his nervous crisis he did. not keep in touch
with her, but he believes that her mother had returned to Quito by now:
LOGIONV knows her from some of the perties LAl and his friends were
Eiving during the Olympics or briefly after them.
7.
He forgot to tell me that he was with Andrea CATANO (P-13,546)
after she returned from her trip to the US end Canada and she told him
that she definitely broke with CHERRISH (P-13,042) by telling him that
the had a boy friend about when she is serious and who is a jealous type:
he (G) is wellcone to come to her (parents) hote when he wishes, but
she is in no pesition to meet with him out.
8.
I asked L-1 was it possible that LOGIONV, who according to him
wda. driving hard to wakata achieve some success before he leaves, might
have attempted to rectuit Juan Huis ALVARSS, director of the language
school on Tiber, during the past 2 months. L-1 stated that he doubted
that JLA would even want to see LOGIONV because LOG in many instances
ignored JLA's requests through L-1 to pase by the school. L-1 went on
to say that if by incident LOG got hold of JLA and made an bit most
elait his services, L-1 was positive that JLA would had turned to
(NOTS: This leaves unsolved what was L-1 speaking about when he spoke
about the good time LOGIONV and JLA had together at unknown date).
9.
I tried to explain to L-1 that he should do some writing for
us along the lines of maxx our previous agreement. He presised.

As much as L-1 is a compulsory talker, during this meet he
was rather on the quite side, i.e., he spoke when he was asked something.
He had only 2 drinks and he took some food with them. He was interested
in leaving on time which was pleasant news to me.
11.
On the way to his car I asked L-1 what he thought about the
death of 16 Sov Generals in 15 weeks. He commented to the effect that
a
published purge of big wheels is intended to silence tdeposition
and this may be necessary in view of the fact that a number of soldiers
will start returning from Czechoslovakia and their stories would be
the opposite What the government used us excuse for invading Czecho.

1.
On Kay 13 at 1930 hr. COIGHE met with FERNALD and briefed him
on LIOVAL-1's past and present operational activity as well as gave ad
outline for future handling of LIOVAL-1. At 2030 hrs 0 and F met with
LIOVAL-1 at HOYO 19. restaurant where in the course of a ffeerwall dinner
the turnover was effected.
Next F - L-1 meet: May 21 at 1330 hre at the same restaurant.
2.
Comno:

23-99-34 from 0800-1410 hrs at his school; on phone
75-10-03 at home except Wednesdays when he will be
home from 1600-1700 hrs.
5B
e. L-1 can use the extention 870 to leave a message for
F (whom he knows under the slias of Victor Brandon),
L-1 will usually state: that he wants to see 3 on
can
given day and time, which means that he will be waiting
for P at a restaurant which will be selected as
their meet site on their next meet.
3.
Security:
a. Standard security practices will be applied to P - L-1
personal meets and other operational activity.
b. On their next meet a new meet sight will be selected.
c. For internal use only: C instructed F that with regard
to what can be said to L-1 there was no use of getting

we recruited LIBACON-1, then he should be told.about it.
4.
Admin & Finance:
a. L-1 considers it probable that he owes LIBACON-1
payment for several lessons. He will ascertain the
amount and F will pay it on the next meet.
b. C infoed L-1 about the status of the order of a Polboat

c. With regard to ops expenses former agreement remains
in power.
5.
Operational:
a. L-1 reported on LIRACON-Is statements to him about
LOGINOV on May 2 (reported separately). This provided
a taylor made openening for operational directives.
b. L-1 will continuse his contact with LIBACON-1 through
leaguge classes, because LIBACON-1 is still a person
of interdert to us.
c. We received from other sources info that LOGINOV would
leave POS in July. In view of the fact that Sov IS
officers are judged home by the meccanical computation
of their activity abroad, our experience shows that
a good number of then try to embellish their record
in the 1dest 2-3 months before their departure by
establishing contacts and making recruitment attempts
with disregard for security rules and sound operation-
practices. We have sufficient indications that LOGINOV
falls in this category of Sov IS officers without
trying to determine whether LIRACON-Is statements to
L-1 may be an additional indication to that effect,
As far as we know LCGINOV it would be in line with
his recent behavior if he approached L-1.
d. If L-1 is approached by LOGINOV or another Sov official
he will act friendly and speak about his frienship
with Pavel YATSKOV. L-1 will cake a remark to the
effect that F1 failed to keep his promise and send him


56.
- 3 -
his Moscow address.
e. If LOGINOV, or whoever it may be, disclains knowledge
about L-1 - YATEKOV friendly relation, L-1 will spéak
in terms that this fact ought to be a common knowledge
in the Sov Embassy.
f. If the person making the approach accuses L-1 for
trying to buy a Sov official (PY), L-1 pretend that
the
approacher is grossly mistaken and will open a
barrage of questions to detaraine what was known
here about the PY case. If the correct sum involved
in that case is mentioned, or place the pitch was made
or other detail(s) indicating that the approacher is
cognisant of this specific case, L-1 will politely
ask what the approscher wanted from him and will not
hesitate to tell him that the same offer applies to
the approacher.
g. If LOGINOV makes the approach under the pretext of
wishing to maintain friendly relation with L-1 and
admite knowing FY and having heard about PYU friend-
ship with L-1 he will be treated friendly and L-1
will invite him to a dinner and let him talk. In
such a case it would be obvious that LOGINOV would
want to pass L-1 to somebody else.
h. When, whoever it be, would attempt to recruit L-I
he will stick to his guns of being an American patriot
and will turn him down by stating that he was able
to make a better offer to the recruiter.

Subject: Rafael VIDIELLA Rétis (P-4805)
Valensia LOGINOV (P-11.712)
Source: LIOVAL-1
1.
ON May 2 Rafael gave a language lesson to LIOVAL-1 and on
that occasion he stated that LOGINOV had taken Juan Luie, Director
of the language school on Tiber, for a day of having fun. It was not
clear whether Juan Luis and LOGINOV had a night on the town or they
went out of town for a whole day "to have come fun".
2.
Refael told Li-1 that he did not understand such an attitude
of LOGINOV, because he considered LOGINOV to be a good friend of his
he was surprised that LOGINOV did not invite him together with Juan Luis,
in fact, he could not explain to himself how something like that could
happen.
3.
Rafael went speaking about LOGINOV for some time about how
good he is basically as a men; how pleasant companion he is and what
a good friend he is.
4.
L-1 pointed out that there was nothing factual nor significant
in what he said about LOGINOV, but Li-1 was puzzled by the fact that
"out of the blue sky" Rafael was speaking about LOGINOV and kept on
speaking and speaking.
5.
L-1 believed that Rafaelle pride was hurt inux by the fact that
LOGINOV ignored him, especially, when there was a change of having some
fun. Therefore, L-1 told Rafael that it was possible that LOGINOV wanted
to invite him too, but was not able to reach him by phone, which would
not be unusual in view of the fact that Rafael is practically never
home.
6.
On this same occasion Rafael asked LIOVAL-1 if he would be
kind to pay him the lessons which he owed him. In view of the irregularity
of Rafaelw appearances to give lessons L-1 wan not certain whether he
owed anything or not. Rafael corroborated his request by etating that


58
his wife writes down every payment Fafnel receives and the book shows
that no payment was received since Jan or Feb 27 ( PIP does not remember
which month was mentioned). L-1 stated that if it 80, then, Rafael must
be right. Because he was short of cash he paid him MH 150.- and stated
that he would pay the remainder the next time, i.e. the next lesson,
which was scheduled for Ved Kay 7 at 1700 hra. ( NOTE: Rafael had
a mest with HRP on the same day at 1620 hra, and it was him to pick up
this day and time. Rafael came to this meet on time ).
7.
The fact that Rafael did not show up for the lesson was no
surprice to L-1. Nevertheless, about 1850 Rafaele wife phoned to L-1
and asked to speak to her husband. When L-1 ented that he was not there
she commented that he was supposed to be there at 1800 hra. About an
hour later she called again and L-1 had to state that he did not come
at all. Then, he requested L-1 to give to Rafael the awester of her
daughter which was secondently left at L-1b place. of course nothing hap-
pened, but since that moment L-1 did not hear from Rafael nor his wife.
L-1 pointed out that this was unusual, because if Rafael skippe a lesson
he calle the next day and never later than the third day to apologize.
Further, the sweeter which Rafael was to pick up from L-1, according to
the wife statement, was a part of their daughters kindergarden uniform.
L-1 concluded that he was imclined to believe that Rafael got angry with
him or because he questioned the correctness of the claim for payment
or because he placed him on a spot by telling his wife that he did not
show up at L-1e place.
8.
L-1 was told not to take the matter so seriously since there
was still a chance that Rafael and his wife were on a war path and they
had no time for anything else. L-1 was requested to try to contact Rafael
or his wife as soon as possible. L-1 considered that May 15 (Teachers Day)
would be the best time to do it and there was no objection on his choice
of date since it offered a botter chance of finding Rafael home.
9.
L-1 was also requested to bring to Rafaels attention that the
irregularity of leenone inconveniente him quite hit on one hand and on
the other Rafael loose the money

Cosment by HRP: The fact that L-1 pointed out that Rafaelt talking
about TONIONV does not mean that anvthing hanned recentiv. still colla

Briefs on Keet Held May 7 from 1630 to 2035 hre.
Then came I asked till that hour he can be with me. He said 1830.
At 1815 I paid the bill, but he insisted that we stay a little longer
and for the the rest he would pay the bill: he had 2 additional drinks
while I had my third coffee and a drink.
As we got together he told me that he was on Lay 3 with his
wife at Cuautia and as le was enstring the pool area LIGLIC? was leaving.
LIGC cornered hia for a 15 minute talk which consisted of pressu:ting
LIRACON into making soca arrangements that LOG would be able to meet
LIOYAL-1. Then LIRACON turned him down LOG insisted that they have a lunch
on Thur. Key 8 at the restaurant EL Ferre Andulco ( or sinilier ) at
the Copenhagen about 1230 hre. LIRACON accepted.
LIRACON brought me a bio Sketch on LIGIOT. which was an
interesting paper. The discussed the paper which enabled ne to obtain
explanations and facts on which LIRACON based his general steptemente.
LIRACON readily gave me info on Frof. L. LIEAN. There was
not much, but sufficient to ascertain that he did not attempt to
-ithhold info. from us. (This has that - mufathes abrily marked)
He also gave 202 some info on KIRALW

1.
On May 3 Source went with his family to Cuautla to spend a
day out of town. There, a be a#rely de bumped into LOCIHOV who was
leaving. They talked 15 minutes.
2.
LOGINOV asked Source was he still giving language lessons to
that American (LIOVAL-1). Ae Source answered affirmatively LOC told Source
that he would like to meet LIOVAL-1. SOURCE stated that LIOVAL was not
only a student who pay his leaons but was also a good friend of Source.
Then LOGINOV became quite blunt and gresive : he outright demanded that
LIRACON introduce him to LIOVAL. LIRACON tried to reason out with LOCINOY
that by meeting LIOVAL he would achieve nothing because LIOVAL was
a good family man, 8 person concosive of his responsibility for 4 children,
liberal in his way of thinking but definitely a patriot, and a person
who is attached to his way of life and could not care lees about Socialiam.
LOCINOY then insisted that he and LIRACON have a lunch together "next"
week to talk this matter over. LIRACON agreed to lunch with him on May 8,
i.e., a day after he meets with me.
5.
LIRACON told me that he would stick to his gune and refuse
LOCIHOV$ request to introduce him to LIOVAL. One of special reasons for
doing so, in addition to his desire of not getting involved with that
gang (KCH), we that he considered LIOVAL to be a friend of his and
would not want to do anything which could make LIOVAL suspect that LIRACON
wae a KCB collaborator.
4.
Other, than the fact that LIOVAL exists I know nothing about Mim,
but the sole fact that he is an agent of our forced me to assume that
he was picked up for a good reason and that we must have an objective for
holding him. Therefore, I felt that it would not be wise to let LIRACON
but the door to a possibility ( kaw as much recote as it may be ) that
we counted on the possibility that LIOVAL be approached occntacted by
a Gov official. Further, I kept in mind that we would not want LIRACON to
eip into a double great role. Therefore, I intrueted LIRACON:


63
- 2 -
a. He wishes to be on friendly terms with LOCIHOY, but
certainly it is not a friendly attitude of LOCIHOY
asks him something impossible. (Try to get LOG to
do explaining).
d. Repeat description of LIOVARY personality as he did
in Cuautia and ask what can LOCIHOY possibly achieve
by meeting LIOVAL. It is anticipated that LOCIHOY
may be brief and say that this would be his problem
and that all ELIEED LIEACON had to do is to arrange
for en introduction.
c. LIRACON will insistz that he does not went to get
involved "in that kind of businees", especially,
because it was clear to him that even if LOCIHOY
achieves nothing, he lost nothing, but LIRACON is
a sure loser because he would lore a friend and
poesibly get tagged as a Sov spy.
d. If LOCIHOY does not break off his ineisting at this
point, LIRACON will state that he would agree on a
plan, if LOCIHOY had one, by which LIOVAL would be
in LIRACON's company, but no introduction of LOCIHOY
as a friend of LIAACON would be made. We played it
back and forth discussing various possibilities, but
important was that LOCIHOY should come up with a
plan. and that LIOVAL be given a possibility of saying
to LIRACON that he did not want to come.
e. After the, lunoh LIEACON will go to his institute
and I would phone him there to find out at which point
the conv with LOCIHOY ENDED.

LIRACON-1 stated that a 3M student of hie postponed his
lesson for a half of an hour and that he phoned to LOIGINOV to come
to the restaurant they were to lunch about 45 minutes later than they
had agreed to meet there. LOCINOV told LIRACON that in that case he

su condicion física y más que nada su apariencia. En este sentido
es muy vanidoso. Muy pocos amigos saben que tiene una hija de
16-17 años. Cuando le preguntan si tiene hijos hable solo de su
hijo de 11 años de edad. Le da pena presentar a su mujer, que es
muy amable y buena, porque se vo de mds edad que él. No fuma, toma
cigarens

y siempre se le ve sereno. Es muy amable en el trato. Nunea trata
de inponer sus ideas, pero siempre pendiente de convencer por las
buenas a sus contrincantes. Cuando ve que no puede hacer lo último,
rompe diplomaticamente los relaciones amistosas con el sujeto.
En sus ideas es de la escuela estalinista; solo cuenta lo Unión
Sovietica y la última línea a seguir del Partido. Eso quiere decir
que no tiene ideas propias. Sigue ridelisimamente la "línea" porque
sabe nuy bien qué es la dánica forma rápida, y eficaz de escalar en
su carrera. Le gusta muchísimo la vida buena, tipo occidental,
aunque antes se dejaría cortar un brazo qué confesarselo asi mismo.
Es muy ámbicioso y se ve que tiene problemas con sus compañeros de

hablando de lo mismo: En el fondo creo que todo eso revela cierta

CONTACT REPORT
SUBJECT
: RESABER (P-8777)
DATE OF MESTING : 10 April 1969
1. In response to BESEABER's phone call, I met him at
his hotel room in the Aristos from 1430 until 1545. Next
meeting will be on Tuesday evening, 15 April at home.
2. Subject had nothing new to report on contacts with
BEDOXers, but said that he is now raring to go on any require-
ments I might levy. He said that all of his financial problems
are now solved (as I surmised they would). Essentially, he has
sold 50% of his business (INZA) to a syndicate-group that is
paying off Subject's debts. They will construct a big new
factory complex in Cuernavaca to bring all of Subject's
manufacturing enterprises under one roof and double capacity.
They'ro also going to open up offices and a showroom on Insur-
gentes Sur. Subject figures he will probably stay active for
a couple of years more and then sell his remaining 50% for
about a half million dollars.
3. I told Subject again that I am now anxious for his
to establish a social relationship with SPYRA (P-6601) and
that I am no longer interested in his developing NAUCHCHIZAK
per se. I suggested that he might use KAS singly as an entree
to meeting SPYRA, ostensibly to work out a cultural program of
Subject's grandfather's music as mentioned previously. Subject
said that he would get on it right away and would try to call
the Ambassador on Tuesday when Subject is back in town.

68
4. I also asked Subject to get back in touch with
Boris CE:YKOV (P-6235) and Valentin LOGINOV (P-11,712) to
warr up the relationship. I pointed out that we should be
prepared to have Subject in a position to give them gifts in
the event Head-warters approves the plan to bug some of
Subject's Trojan horses. Unless therd is some reasonably good
contact established in advance, his presenting gifts will
appear too contrived. Subject agreed and said that he would
give them a phone call soon to try to got together for drinks.
Judging from past history, CE:YKOV will be ready to see Subject
for a night on the town in August.
5. I paid Subject $3000 (MN) constituting half of his
rotainer for three months (Jan., Feb. and March) and agreed to
have the balance of $3000 for him on Tuesday. He gave me a
2
pile of hotel bills and other expenses which will be charged
against the $3000 revolving fund he has outstanding. He asked
me if I could get him a case of champagne, a couple of bottles
of cognac, a bottle of gin. I told him that I'd see if these
are available and that, if they are, I would charge them against
either his salary or fund rather than as outright gifts as in
the past.

I. saw that Vali was not playing, but looking for a part-
ner white talking to Mache Pinto and an other girl. Ha
was two courts away from me. I finished playing with
my spasmant opponent. I couldn't see walking over to
Val and invite him to play. He knew I was finished.
He also oved me an apology for the cancelled luncheon
date.
I shouted loudly to a ball-boy to find my favorite
trainer. Val dashed over to say he would like to play.
Excuse for missed lunch. I "what happened to our
luncheon date", I asked with no smile. Val said that
Dimi had been bitten badly by a dog. I told Val that
I had already heard that story and that Dimi had been
asked to be a good deal of interest. I would like to
did not smile and cave him little opportunity for
a gradious acceptance of a poor excuse. It was clear
that I was annoyed. I could see from Val's expression
that he was embarrassed and off-balance. He has a pecu-
liar facial expression when he has been put at a dis-
advantage.
Val admitted. that the bite had been much earlier,
but he exlained that the would had become inflamed
and he had to take Dimi to a doctor. I saw Dimi and
he had one of the smaller Bandaids on his arm. He
seemed to be having no discomfort.
I accepted Val's excuse tacitly.
We played Unfortunately Kal won 6-3, 6-1. I
remind you that I switched to my left arm some time
ago and am still at a disadvantage. I still apologize
for letting the barbarian win. I had to leave at
1145. immodiately threochother men invited Val to make
a fourth for doubles. I had hoped to talk to him when
we finished.
Convaration, I finally had to interrupt Val while
the men vore still warning up and take him to a corner
of the court.
I told val that I had honed to tell him something
at the time and on several other occasions but was
always interrupted. Now I wanted to tell him what I
had in mind. I wanted him to understand that his
nolitical jokno had emharrasued me. That I did not
want to create a scene and had never commented on
them. But I would not tolerate them in the future.


70
I said that his offer to give me money to work for
his government had embarrassed me in front of our mutual
friends. Further, my colite refusal to make an issue of
his approach could have been introprotéd as tacit accep-
kacco of his offer to pay ms for treason against my
country.
yial interrupted and said it was all a joke and
that he thought I appreciated that it was nothing
more than a joke.
I said I knew it was a joke, but could not speak
for our audience. My position as a businessman here
could be jeopardized if someone thought we were serious.
I told val that in any case, joking or not, I do
not discuss politics or religion with my friends, par
ticularly here in Mexico.
He acted very surprised and amused.
I pointed out that I consider myself a guest in
a very hospitable but foreign country. "These people
are my hosts. You are a diomat. You can, you must
discuss politics. It is your job. I cannot. I actually
am not interested in politics. I am not well versed
in politics. But if you must talk politics with me,
let us go some where in private, without an audience.
"If you want to discuss business, fine! I know that
subject and I like it. and I am even better with an
audience.
I am not.
val had his transparently disturbed, distressed
and disadvantaged look. He promised never to discuss
politics with me again. He apologized. He said he
understood what I meant.
F-m him.

SURJECT: Gloria Pinto
DATE OF INFORMATION: 26 March 1969. 1306-1355 hours.
PLACE ACQUIRED: Office of John Francis
REPORT BY: John Francis
Tolcnbone call to moffice. Gloria cälled to say
she was having some trouble finding clients for my
business. She asked when she could see me. I suggested
immediately and she arrived about one hour later.
Personal shat prior to business. Gloria followed
good Mexican custom in chatting lightly before getting
to the matter about which the meeting was called.
Mochel and San Luis Potosia I asked Gloria if
she were going to San Luis Potosi this year for the
Holly Week tennis tournaments. She said that she had
planned to do so but was unable to find some one to
go with her at the last moment. Pepa did not want to
be the most important part of the company. She was
panded by several other women or by Meche. Meche re-
fused to go saying she would have no fun if with her
mother and planned to go to Corpus Christi by her-
self.
Some to Europe adin. Gloria volunteered that
she was annoyed with, there. She deplores his Latin
attitude about the double standard. She has been
prohibited to take several brief trips to various
cities in Mexico to see friends and family. She is
not welcome to accompany Pape on his trins. Yet he
will soon take a few times a few times a few times a
few times a few times a South America. Gloria said that she
has been waiting all these years for her children to
grow up so that she could go with Pepo on his trips.
Now that shey are grown up, she finds that she still
is expected to stay home.
Gloria watched carefully. Gloria must account for
her time very carefully to Fepe during the day. And
he said he was not taking a short after dark.
Pepe apparently was going to of Gloria working for me.
He does not like the idea that she will be visiting
businessmen throughout the city both in their offices
and homes. He has expressed his disapproval, but
Gloria has chosen to ignore it.
Wantn to send Meche to U.S. Gloria wants to fight
the attitude of superiority over the women that Latin man
was not going to be able to bother, not herself. Gboria
fools that she will never bo able to enjoy anything
close to equal treatment and consideration with Pope.
But she feels that her daughter should escape from
this Latin horradiation. Two or three years working
in Now York or can Francisco is Gloria's dream for
cemile for 11/12 and 1-13723


72
No luck with business. Gloria seems very enthu-
giastic about working for me. Not so much to help me
but to give herself an excuse to get out and do some-
things. Further, she said. "I think I'm not going
to do anything other than raise children.
She was married when very young and has never worked.
She hones eventually to start some business of her own.
she probably wants to have a shopm of some kind.
Working for me is a trial for herself. She hopes to
prove to herself that she can succeed in business and
meeting people."
The approach she has been taking with my business
has been unsuccessful so far. I have given her the one
which is most time-consuming and one which I would not
have been able to do by my self. There are other approaches,
but I have not outlined these to her as yet.
We discussed her approach and some modifications
of it. We agreed to review her sales approach after
the Holy Week and decide whether to proceed along
different lines.
LOLINOV P-11712
Discussion of Val. Having completed our business
I raised the matter of Val. I reminded her that I had
explained to her some time ago that I was not
val's trade in the company. I have also has a
significant product to recruit me in the presence of mutual friends.
I told her that t I still hadn't had a chance to talk to
val in private. I repeated that all I wanted to do was
make it clear to him that I hold him. I would have
a painting of the company. I'm not interested in
assisting his government, and wanted him to stop jeo-
pardizing our friendship with his offensive approaches,
Whetzen subtle and implied or direct and coarse.
I told Gloria that I had planned to have lunch
with Val today. I enjoy Val's company's rarely have a
chance to chat quietly; don't like to eat lunch by
myself and looked forward to explaining to Val my
position before he completely destroyed any chance
for us to continue as much.
Not aware of the incident to Dmitri. I told Gloria
that Val had excused himself from our lunch date due
to an accident to his son. She did not know of any
accident other than the dog bite the previous week.
Gloria said that his declining my invitation
might have been an afterthought. That he did not want
to hurt my by being seen with me in a public place.


73
Avoids "hurtina" his friends. Gloria thon told me
that Val never accented an invitation to have coffee with
her or Pene or to dine out. He explained to her that it
could hurt her to be seen with him. She gave an example
of when she was invited to the ballet with Val and a
group of friends.
After a ballet, Rabe and Gloria invited Val to
join her for dinner. Val declined. Pepe and Gloria
went to the Hoyo 19. Shortly after they arrived, Val
and a large number of embassy officers also arrived.
Val steered them away from Pepe and Gloria. Shortly
afterwards a man arrived, sat at a remote table and
took notes while watching the Soviets.
Val works mornings only. Gloria then mentioned that
Val is in the embassy only in the dining. This was
the most important. He said. I had tried to call
the embassy and talk to Val to find out what had hap-
pened to Dmitri, but since he was out, I would call
in the afternoon. She added that he of course works
in the afternoon, but outside the embassy. I said "try-

Mexicans".
COMMENTS
It seems to me highly unlikely that Val is
really concerned about the welfare of his friends
seen with him. It seems quite clear that he con-
siders Gloria and Pepe, and perhaps me, as potential
assets. He does not want to be seen with us because
we would lose our value to him. He told Gloria that
they should confine the message. He said. "I
Club. This seems to be confirm the suspicion that he
believe that he is to a secure place to meet people.
It is possible that he checked with his colleagues
and they were of the opinion that my choice of the
Llave de Oro for lunch was too public, exposed us
to too many Americans.
I feel that Gloria has served a very useful
purpose in this matter. If she is working for Val,
which I doubt, she is in a position to see that my
business is indeed legitimate, time-consuming, and
with considerable financial support. He is the
society for a position to stay to Val my unwillingness
to do so. I have with him and his government and my threat
to take the matter to the embassy if his harassment
continues.

ubject sait that if LOGINGY received an invitation to ANKERS perty, that it
might have come from CHIRNISH (P-13.042). During his converzations with ANNRIA,
she never mentioned the fact that LOGINGY went to the party. She never told
Subject exactly who went.

Concerning ANDREA CATANO: 17-13576
About ten days ago ANDREA went to Commercial Moxirens to do the veokly
grocery shopping. Subject dropped by her house while she was gone. Shortly
after arriving at her house, she called home and he talked to her on the phone.
She said that sho had some problems at the store and asked if he could come
down and bring some money. He went with her brother, and on arriving at the
store found her in custody of two man-gers and a Policeman. They had caught
her trying to walk out with a stolen jor of face cream (she admitted it) and
she did not have the money to pay for it. Subject talked to the neneers, tolling
thom that she was just a young girl, etc., and convinced them to do nothing about
it Rafael paid for the face cress and they took her home. (Rafael thinks
this is a very unusual side of her chacteret that he has never seen before).
ANDREA has not mentioned CHIRNISH to Subject since my last report.
Rafael said that he will begin to pump ANDREA for some further in'om: tion (in
a discreet way). As far as, he knows. she has not seen CHIRNISH lately. (perhaps
since the party on 1 March).

Concerning Rafael's MOTHER AND HIR HORN AT THE EMASSY:
(I asked Subject several questions about his mother, but he dodged them.
He seemed unwilling to discuss her, and after several tries I stopped pushing).
Rafael said that his Mother hos one particular student in Spanish (at the Embassy)
who has repeatedly expressed the desire to meet and become friends with Rafael.
His Mother likes the man (her student) and said tht she will shortly invite him
home for dinner so that he and Rafael cen become acquainted. (Rafael by now is
suspicious of any inbassy official who wants to become friends). The man is

Valentin Loution
DATHA 02 INKOWNIO: March 24, 1989, 1203-1205
PLACS ACQUIRED: Telephone call to my office.
Telechane call. val called ma at my office. : accurs
the call was from a public telephone booth, since there
was considerable background noise of traffic. He would
not identify himself x to my secretary, but said that he
was a friend.
Invited ne to drink. Val asked if it would be con-
venient for ma to got totoether this afternoon for a
drink. I checked my schedule and said that today would
not be a good day. Instead I suggested that he be my
guest for lunch on Wednesday.
Eunchman data. I told him to meet ma Wednesday it
14000 hours at the Llave de Cro.
There was much discussion about how to find the
Llave de Oro. He was not familiar with the restaurant,
nor with the massage with its restaurants and shate.
I had to explain that it was bordered by Livergoo.
Gonova, Londres and Insurance.
Camera not the time. I assumed that Val's call
was coming to her simulated to his interest in selling
his class. He took me. Therefore, I recorded to his
camera and reminded him not to gorget it. He said that
this was not the reason he called and that he really
wasn't in a big hurry to sell it. He said he wants
to chat with me.
I told him to 'bring the camera anyway since I had
just this morning spoken to my friend who owns a cencet
store and was sure I could dispose of his camen for
him. He did pork up then and show some interest in the
camera.

Valentin Loquinow
IN THE OF INFORATION: March 22, 1969
FLOCE AQUURED: Pranch Club
Tounies: Val had come, probably thinking list
and I Would comolge our mater with Val and Kecma
however, was out of town this weekend. Mecha went
to way. Val and Gloria Pinto (the mother of Kechic; W2C
playing singles when I arrived. I had a singles touraniment
mycoif and did not join them until an hour later. He
formed a cubicles group. I playcd with Pope Pinto, and Val
played with Gloria against us.
As is always the case, these is very little mortunity
for conversation during a cennis match. Val did make a few
stupid comments of apolitical nature, but entirely harmless,
such as, addressed to me, haven't you any control over your
friend. The Dismar Cundes
I did not get a chance to confront Valentin about his
sorvactive comments and how they jeopardized our friend-
ship.
Val asked me if I had given any thouzit to his request
the previous week. I could not believe that he was going to
open the matter about his offering me money for "secretes".
Therefore, I was genuinely scupid about vast request. He
reminded me that he had spoken of a movie camera he wanted
to be and which I had stated that I thought I could dis-
pose of it for him through friend 5 of mine, on consignment.
I told him to bring me the camera and I would see what I
could do.
I then told Val that there was something I had wanted
to talk to him about anyway, land hoped we could get together
sometime soon to do so. He stated that he would not come to
the club tomorrow. He offered to take me to lunch sometime
during the week.
I don't exactly what I had in mind for an informal
and not too pleasant statement of my position about his
approach to ms. But I feel it can be used and will achieve
the desired effect. Unfortunately, he might spond the text
few days wondering if I am about to accept his approach.

12 Karch 1969
CONTACT REPORT
FRCM
: Samuel J. KARTASUK
SUBJECT : Rafael VIDHILLA Rula (P-505)
A meeting was held from 1130 to 1430, 11 March 1969, in Chalupas Reostaurant
on Ave. Reforma, one block west of Reforma and Prado Norte. The date and
hour of the next meeting will be established by telephone. Subject will pick
up Kartasuk on Reforma, in front of the anthropology Museum at a specified time.
1.
I parked my. cer three blocks North of the Chalupas and walked to the
meeting site arriving there at 1125. Subject was waiting at a table reading
one of the Russian books I had previously given him. We met, talked, and conducted
our meeting over a period of three hours and then parted company.
2.
The initial conversation was general. He at first commented on how
well he liked the two books he had received from me, and made some statements
on the truth of their context. We ordered some breakfast and I then asked him
if he would mind filling out the questionnaire (PRU) I had with me, explaining
that it was merely routine. He readily agreed and I gave it to him and helped
him fill it out. (PRQ submitted on 12 March). After completing the form I
brought out a list of questions I wanted to ask and began going through them.
He answered all of those he could, providing the following information:
Gridy A. (FRU) MARTINEZ, GNER OF THE PLAZA KOTEL:
Rafael does not remember MARTINIZ full name but promised to
obtain it at the first opportunity. MARTINIZ has a wife and son. The wife
originally comes from Santander, Spain. His son (no nAVE remembered) is about
18 or 19 years of age, (8 years ago, now about 26) and at times was helping
around the desk of the hotel when Rafael was teaching his father Russian, (1960-
1961). Rafael gave MORTINIZ Russian for about 6 months, during which time
MARTINIZ learned to speak, ani understand fairly well. MARTINIZ Niver discussed
why he wanted to learn Russian with Rafael, nor did they talk policies, either
Russian or American,


67
then Rafael met PRINKODKO (P-2270) at the Plaza-Hotci, PRINKODKO later mentioned
that he had some business with MARTINZ concerning Tourists and Tourism, but
did not expound on the Subject. MARTINZ never discussed his association with
PRINODKO and Subject did not ask. During the latter part of 1962 Rafael
won't to the hotel and by chance saw four or five Soviets in MARTINZ office.
he heard then talking, but did not go into the office. He thinks he has seen
one of these Russians since but does not know the name of any of them. Kortinen
never mentioned them or their business with him. In September 1968, just prior
to the Olympics, Rafael to see Kortines, trying to drum up some more private
Russian lessons. MARTILIZZ told him that he was ready to take any more Russian
lossons. but that he was very interested in learning German as soon as possible.
Kortincz said the he was currently (then) taking lessons. but that he did not
like his teacher, (Did not say who his teacher was). Rafael offered to bring
a
together from his Institute. Martines mentioned that the German Olympic team
would be staying at his hotel. Shortly after Rafael brought a girl from the
Institute named Gorda (LNU) to see Martines. While there they were invited to
lunch and met three Koxicon men and a tall German who said he was a representative
of the german team They had lunch, conversed about general things, and Rafael
and the girl left. The girl later said that Martines had continued taking Germ
lessons from his old teacher. This was the last time Rafael saw MARTINZ.
Rafael could supply no biographical data on Zartines, or any further information
on any connections with Soviets. Subject has not heard any other Soviet mention
either Martinez or the Pleasa Hotel.
B. PRLATIONSHIP BELLEN LOOINGO (P-11712) AND JGAS LUIS, DRLACTOR OF
THE LANGUAGE INSTITUTE ON TEHER:
In about 1965 or 1966, LOOINGV went to the Institute to take
English lessons. He took lessons for about 6 to 8 months. The lessons were
private, but given at the Institute by an Amorican girl nared Janet (LNU - Rafar
does not remember her lost name, and the is no longer there). it was in this
manner the it JUAN LUIS not LOLINGY.


28
JUNA LUIS mentioned to Rafael that ho liked LOIGINOV, and they scend fairly
friendly. It was at the end of this period that Raaol was introduced to
LOGINOV by JUAN LUS. the LOINOV to-inated his lessons he no longer visited
the Institute. JUAN LUIS often sent his regards to LOIGINOV via R.Fael, and
asked that LOINOV come to see him. This was mentioned by Rafeel, but LOIGINOV
continually told R-fael to "forget it", but did ask Rafael to return the regards.
Rafael never questioned LOINOV on why he did not go back to the Institute, but
as far as Subject knows, LOIGINOV has not been back. Rafael has had many
discussions with JUAN LUIS but he has never mentioned any other Soviets in
Mexico. As far as his politics go, JUAN LUIS is a confirmed Leftist in ideas
but Rafael would not call him a Communist. Rafael believes that Juan Luis
was merely a friend to LOGINOV and had no direct relations with him other than
their association through lessons.
C. Andrea CATANO (P-13,546):
Andrea has mentioned to Rafael that she met CHERNISH (P-13,042)
at the Space Exhibit while she was working there. She also met several other
Soviets there. She became friends with then and invited them to her house
for a dinner party on two occasions. Rafael, invited by her, went on both
occasions. On the first occasions there was a Russian woman, blond, about 36
years old named-VALENTINA (LNU) who spoke very good spanish: a man named
NISHA (LNU), supposedly an Electrical Tech from DUBO Space Center near Koscow,
about 37 years old and tall, who spoke excellent Spanish and who later wrote a
letter to one of Andreas girlfriends in Mexico City (Not named): and ORIS (LNC).
about 37 years old, thin, nervous but with a lot of vitality and personality.
Boris spoke excellent Spanish also, and Rafael thought it very unusual that he
crank American whistoy and Coca-cola. (R.Fael says this is unusual for Russian
Treaal thought KISHA a little suspicious, that he might be KGB (ho knows that
in cases such as this, no one is allowed to go anywhere with being accompanied
by the KUN) because KISHA spoke excellent Spanish an: second to be the only
ore who did not really fit.


The other Soviet was named VLADIER (L..), about 37 years old, and did not
speak any Spanish at all, but was very nice, According to :a'ael, he was the
only true Scientist there, (Also from Dubno).
At the second party the Russian woman did not come, Andreas American
boss from the Exhibit came however with a Mexican man, (Rafael does not remember
his name). Rafael says he was a nice guy. He was about 43 years old, tall and
sooked a cigar. He joked with the Russians and told then to be careful because
Andrea was his spy. They all laughed. He came with two dark Nexicans and
left shortly after dimor. Rafael said he drank a considerable amount and left
drunk. CERNESH did not attend either of these perties. Andrea however invited
him over on other occasions. On one occasion CHERNISH brought another Soviet
to Andreas whom he said was a Military zan. (No name mentioned by Andrea). Andrea
said that this one was a pain in the ass because he was so serious it through
the group (her mother also) into a depressed state. After the Exhibit CHRENISH
started calling Andrea at home and inviting her to meet him in various cafes.
which she did. He cautioned her to never call his at the Embassy. He was
invited to her house many times and o:ten sat and discussed his politics (any
all other topics) with her and her moth 2. Her mother took issue with his poll:
Eer mother liked CHERNISH but does not know that Andrea is seeing him on the
She would not approve of Andrea going out with CHERNISH at all. CHERNISH began
making arorous advances to andrea and tried to talk her into going to bed with
him. Andrea told Rafael that he is a very nice guy, she liked him, but was a
She said th-t he almost convinced her to go to bed, and that it is her decision
that she is no longer going to see CHERNISH for fear o: doing so. Realel had
cautioned her about what she had to lose if she did. She continues to like
CHERNISH however.
Andrea had a party on 1 March and asked S.Fael to invite LOGINOW.
CHERNISH went to this party. Rafael did not bother to ask ICLINOW at all.


90
Andrea has often extended an invitation to LOGNOV through Seafool, but when
Refael mentions this to LOGNOV, LOOINOV has told him to forget it because
other people from his Embassy are seeing her and LOGNOV does not want to
appear there and cause trouble. LOGNOV did notlexpound and R-fael did not
ask further explanation. Rafael thinks that CHEKNESS really wants to take
Andrea to bed, but he also thinks that CHEKNESS is up to other things also.
He has no idea what, but just suspects.

At the end of the meeting I gave him an envelope with 1,000.00 pesos in cash
in it. He accepted it graciously and said that that would last hin about 25
hours considering the debts he had to pay. so leugbed. I brought out a receip
and asked him if he would mind signing it for mo. I said it was for accountin
purposes (he did not ask). He said "sure" and signed it immediately. "e 10"
the restaurant. walked to his car, and said goshby until next meeting.

We stood by the car talking for about three minutes, and I promised to call
him during the afternoon of Friday, 14 March. On departing he grinned and said
to say hello to all of his associates that he doesn't know. I said "Sure will"
and walked away.

SUBJECT: Valentin Loquinov
DATE OF INFORMATION: February 2, 1969
PLACE ACQUIRED l'arty at the home of Dr. Luis Gomez.
Our tennis group meets occasionally at each others
homes, for lunch, dinner, or just drinks. Luis Gomez
invited us this time to his home in *x33 Pedregal for
lunch.
After I had made a point of not sitting near Val,
several women wanted to change places and Val and
another person changed places putting Val next to me.
He opened the old issue by saying that he assumed
I was making for the company. He said that he had seen
me personally and times" at Sanborns with American
intelligence officers, who had been asked me with. He
avoided the question. I then volunteered to him must
have been Bill Spruce, with whom I frequently have
lunch, He asked what section Spruce was in. I answered
the economic. He seemed disgusted, and sadd Spruce
wasn't worth anything.
I would have been told he wanted me to know that he
was prepared to pay a lot of money for any information
I might obtain for him. I said I'd talk to Spruce about
it and see if he had anything to seal so that I could
take my commission. I added that Spruce would probably
faint or tremble with terror--this pleased val greatly.
I then asked Val if the Americans had ever offered
him any money for his information. like averted my eyes
and answered "not yet".
COMMENTS
Val is an assil
"Several mimes* times" is, of course, inaccurate
and shows that he is guessing. It seems very unlikely
that he saw me even the one time.
Val probably regrets that we have not approached
him. But he is sezckorazal not so stupid that he does
not realize that we know he has no trade, profession,
and the most talents which would make life for him ary-
where out of the time and government service possible.
Val is doing the only thing he knows how, and he knows
it, and he must realize the way we know it. Hence, defection
for him is out of the question. He would only make a
short-term profit in doing so.
I have invited Bill Spruce to lunch this week. I
will develop him as my excuse and answer for any further
prison of the total. Spruce, incidentally, is a very
clever and helpful way. They last meeting with him was
two years ago and I am still benefiting from his advice.
He has since transferred to the finance section, but
this should not affect his value to me and my cover.

SURJECT: Valentin Loquinov
DATE OF INFECRICATION: February 1, 1969. 1200 hours.
PLACE ACQUIRED: French Club
Interest in American School. Val asked me if I
could recall the address of the American school. He will
call me for x it. He wants to have his son Dmitri par-
ticipate in some activities with the children at the
school in order to learn English. Dmitri finishes
school at the Russian embassy at 1400 hours, Val hopes
that maybe there are some afterschool activities such
as football for Dmitri.
COMMENT
This may be just Val's inate stupidity. Naybe he
really couldn't find the American Subcool in the tele-
phone directory.
Perhaps Val already knows of some after-school activity
of which I am unaware. Naybe he already knows that someone's
child is there, someone he wants to meet. Perhaps he wants
an excuse to wander about the school, meeting people.
Perhaps Val couldn't care less about the school. Per-
haps he has been for an excuse to call me, suggesting our
children practice. He has been the Perhaps he is preparing
the ground fix to go to someone else. Any day has in mind
to explain that there is no convenient program of after-
school activities for Dmitri. He might ask that person to
agree to have Dmitri play with his children.
It just occured to me that for the first time in many
months Valentin spoke Russian to me. While I was playing
tennis by the United Arab in Russian, "You really are playing
with your left now". And the world was a very good
answered that I was and that I had a headache, He looked
particularly pleased. Normally he doesn't even answer my
Good Noriáng in Russian. Perhaps he is preparing the
way for me to suggest an exchange in language lessons: he
helps me with my Russian and Exix my boys play with Diml
in English.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILK
COPIES MADE
the
SUBJECT: Valentin Sergaavich LOCINOW (P-11712)
Attached are five LIEMBRACE Sovies Target of Opportunity reports which
cover the period 12 December 1968 which was the first surveillance to
four follow-up surveillance reports on the first one. On 12 December 1968
the LIEMBRACE team picked up LOGINOV in Colonia Buenos Aires in the company
of an unidentified Mexican man. The LIEMBRACE team followed the Mexican
man, who got into a Renault Dauphine with placas 330 HS. A LIKAYAK check p. 13, 698
revealed that the placas were listed to
Ala hao
Inagacio VALLINA Barros and Susana de VALLINA Fabre
Address: Acdolfo Prieto 1302, Mexico 12, D.P. 14104 Egerante Gabuina 60
toman, Barriaco
A further LIKAYAK check revealed that the VALLINAS did not live at this Adolfo
Prieto address and no further action was planned.
On Thursday, 2 January 1969, LIEMBRACE-5 went into Sears Department Store
on Ejercito Nacional and thought that the store detective was identical to the
man spotted with LOCINOV on 12 December 1968. LIEMBRACE-14 said that although
the store detective looked alot like the man seen with LOCINOV, he wasnot
identical. Photos of this store detective are attached.
On Friday, 3 January 1969 the LIEMBRACE team went to Sears Store on Ejercito
National to check out this store detective. The people at Sears said that if a
name were given to them, they would cooperate.
On Thursday, 9 January 1969, the LIEMBRACE team picked up the store detective
as he was leaving work. The store detective went to a house at Lago Chieu 142-A.
Prior to that he went to an address at Aventida Clavería 64-1.
On Friday 10 January 1969 the LIEMBRACLE team gave us the result of a check at

SUBJECT: Surveillance of THE Suggest Faint content
En un reporte del dia 12 de Diciembre de 1963, en el que 5 y 14 vieron a LOGINV acompañado
de un hobre tipo mexicano caninando por un puente de peatones del viaducto Miguel Alman que
esta's la altura de la calle Eje Doi. Y que despues este último se fúl en un Renault negro-
placas No. $90 HS. y 10. perdieron entrando al viaducto.
S fúl el martes 51 a la tienda Sears de Ejercito Nacional y le pareció que el detective de
está tienda es el mismo que se vió con LOGINOV.Llevamos a 14 para que también lo identificara.
Dico 14 que se parece mucho, pero que no es. 5 dice que está seguro que si es,
En la descripción que dieron ellos ese día dijeron que on la cara se le veía como que había
tenido aná, y este no tiene ninguna marca de essa. De todas maneras: lo fotografianos,
Buscames el Renault en el estacionamiento y no estaba.

in lossia. Subject and that when he first arrived in Lexico his major cestive
was to visit a book store. When he m-nzgd. to visit one he was
at
the variety of literature for sole which was absolutely banned to Russians,
he could not help feeling nerveus while in the bookstore, and later cried
when he got home. (Use to the sections he feit). it the first eonportunity
he began buying and reading all of the books he could: afford. It took him
a long time in order to be able to sit in a public are and ooneyl rend a
book without feeling sose kind of fear.
As regards to Cube he has heard conflicting stories, he believes
that Castro has done some good for the Cubens, (by raising their standard
education level), but that from stories he h-s heard, the Cubens' had
a much higher economic standard of living (thn- kexico) rive to the Castro
regine. He has often discussed these polotics with LOQINOV. In a crowd
LOGNOV tends to say good things about Castro and the Cuban regime, but
when alone with Subject LOQINOV sneers et Castro and conderns the regime.
This attitude leads subject to believe that the official Soviet attitude
(real attitude) towards Cuba is one of disgust. During discussions in a
groua, LOQINOV has stated that they (Soviets) ere not in favor of Guerillas
operating in Centr-1 and S. America. He has repeated this while privately
talking with Subject.
During part of the conversation I began telling him abo:t
the standards of living in the U.S. and what it might be like living there.
We discussed different parts of the U.S. in terms of Geography and what it
had to offer. Subject repeated th-t his wife always thought that it would
be devine living in the U.S. and that he still had hopes of going there in
the future to live.

PACIS
A group of ten or us cclobrated New Yeur's 2vo
together.
1. The 1st Soviet atrive. Gloria wants to
purchase : Prician Lame Court. Alexanira Jorinivo
was one she would be willing to sell, but Gloria
believes it would be too high for Mexico, having
been lined for Noscow weather. Gloria thinks that
the commercial counselor of the Soviet embassy
would be introcted, willing, and able to holp
her in obtaining a Soviet coat.
Gloria also wants to open a shos. She thought
that she likes the could handle imported Soviet goods.
Ker chilts, he said, and enough to take care of
themselves. She feels the most important interest
in opening a shop. She has choctied with the
Real and learned that shop space rents for 12000
ocean per month, she would probably work for some-
day. For a while to learn the proolens in-
volved, more opening her own shop. She admits
to very little education. She has never worked in
her life.
Gloria is the main, but she's that on New Years Evo I
promised to give her much come thought. Frankly,
there is something she could have to be a good
business. I need somcone who is attractive, mature,
but not necessarily very intelligent, and not
the most important experienced, to contact potential
clients, to sell cigarettes. I think Gloria could
fit this requirement. I had a good idea for the
agent: somcone who would receive no salary, but
so the service a parent percentage each month (2004)
of the company, and is not this obtained. Let's
say she would bring to the company a priori
of two or three years. Lost's say further compen-
ber client would represent an income 6250 peces
per year. The average average 20 N 230 x 100 = $500
pesos per rach as long and the average 20000

she could werk as little or as much as she was

- - mation this in 2000 detail because I
think it really would scut Gloria and would
hale no business. If I used for, it would
be
to be a bit of the cigarette against the
sovient. Further, before using for, some thought
ought to be given to the possibility that she
might already be working for the vociots (which
I doubt) and could be targetted against us.
Soviets interest in Gloris. I would not
attempt to explain Way the Sociots might to
interested in Gloria as a target. My gucses
are the following? The following is the
soviet section has probably given this sort of
thing a great deal of experienced thought. I
do believe that Valentin and Gloria might be
having an affair for strictly personal and
sociotical, the same thing is the same
that Valentin might actually be paying his
160
own way at the French Club to pursue a sport
he is fairly good at and enjoya-and not to
in excuse to go to the French Club to find
sotntial recruits.
Our interest in Gloria. I can see a possible
use of Gloria :f restricted by false Mexican secret
service. The scenario would go something like this:
We (the Nexicon secret service) have ob-
served that she (Gloria) has been seen
in the company of Valentin. We know
that the company is not a focus and
destructive person to Mexico.
Would she be willing to report on val-
entin, bis personality, his views,
his activities as far as she is aware of
them.
(Later) Would she to willing to make
comments which would encourage Valen-
tin to try to recruit hor. Such comments
are to be given to the company. We
from various exchanges, knows students
who are anarcists and communists, is
growing more and more disappolited with
the U.S. foreign policy, -becceally since
that imperialist Nixon has taken ever,
etc.
Ultimate use. The eventual value of Gloria
would be:
1. Report vulnérabilities of
2. Report the count when
distrunted, critical of his
fucy to dieict.

3. Report what is least some of the
targets of the covets might be-
namely the assignments from Val.

CONTRACT REPORT
30 January 1969
FROM
: Semuel J. KURRASUK
SUBJECT : Rafa-1 VIOLILLA Rute: contact with on 29 January 1969.
1.
KURRASUK lett lise car in a parkens: lot in the Zona Rosa and walkd
to the vicinity of Sanlorns on Reform and tiber. At 14:55 I called the
Lenguege school where Sutject teaches and was told that he had not yet arrived
for class. I called again at 1:05 and was informed that he was already in clress.
At 1965 I Began waiting in front of the Lenguage school for Subject to come out.
He came out at 1610 and wo walked towards Sanborns. I invited him to go to
La Manzion Resteurent on Inaugortes Sur but he said thrt he had a class schudud
from 1630 to 1800, We want to the Sanborns bar and had a drink. I told him that
I thought th-t two girls I had provioualy not wore going to meet me at the La
Mansion at 1700 and that I wanted him to go with me. After some discussion he
decided that he could postpone the class until Friday, but would have to weit
until 1630 for the pupil to arrive, in order to inform hor. We left the Ear. at
1630 and encountered the student by the magesine stand. Subject made his exencues,
and wo started walking to his car. (Subject had not wanted to miss his class,
and aftor come discussion in the bar, he offered me his car in order that I
go to La Mension and got the girls. I told him that I also wanted to eot, and
that there was a possibility that the girls wouldnt shaw up. He finally corsoned
after some consideration).
Ve arrived at La Kansion shortly before 1700 and went inside, leven
the car parked in the Roastaurant lot. After sitting doin and ordering drinks
and a stook, I told him that I would like to discuss a few important item that
had a lot do to with his future. (I had mentioned during the orevious meeting
that I had some business to talk to him about). I began by telling him th
in our relationship I held neglected to mention sonethine important. : to:

or the Follice, or sonthing. : deid 'no. I'm an intelligence of the
c. S. Government", and showed his ay : D. canu. He looked at it. raised his
cyebroos, but never changed its exeruction on his face. (from the look on his
face, one might thin: ho was vachin; a Buga Burny cartoon). I said that our
files show that for some years he has,considerable contact with members of the
Goviet K33. Before I could go any further he stated that he was not a member
of the K33. nor did he over vork for them. I said that that was whet we believed.
and that was also why I wanted to talk to him. I had a proposition to n-ke to
him. Before I could continue, he said that he had often been apprached (Currently
and in the past) by the K33 to work for them. At present he is being hounded
by Valentin (LOGINOV) to report on his Noxican friends. He considers the KGB
to be a bunch of Bestards (Cibronco) and that he dous not bolico in ill of this
under the table spying, nor doss he believe in what the KGB are trying to do.
and if I'm involved in this work, and I am asking him the some thing, then I'm
the same kind of bestand that the K33 are. He said for some time now, LOGENO
has called him, not him, and asked that he (Subject) srot Kexions (students)
who are either going to the U.S. or look like they might be promising in that
respect, and that he (Subject) preporo biographical data and other detzios
about their current lice, and arrange for them to noet LOIGNOV at pertics, etc.
LOGINOV, during each mooting with Subject, brings an envelope with 500 puso in
cash in it, and continually ofters this to Subject. Subject says that he
doesn't say yes or no, bit that to date ho has not furnished any information and
has not accepted any money. He likes his friends and students. and any cooocorion
with LOIGNOV (along theco linea) would make him feal like a Judas. Besides,
these students are young, and nice people, and the KGB bestards should kea their
hands of then. He said that he appreciated the fact that I would-toly shoued
him an official I.D. card and declared myself, because LOIGNOV did not even have
the docency to do thet, LOIGNOV has never shoved his arythinglet all (in 1.0.)

and never oven extended the country or celling him way he wanted the
information on Mexican students, but Subject times LOUISO: in NOS and doesn't
appreciate the appreach by LOUOWV. 3: LOUOW had approched has honestly.
showed him I.D. and talked about the disclain involved in wh-t he wanted,
Subject might have paid more attention, b.t he (Subject) did not like the
dischancet wey LOUNOWV went cbo t it, coloring nonty and trying to con him.
Subject said, granted, he needs noney, and the 500 pusoos always looks good,
but that if he started doing wh-t LOGINOV wanted, the sight o: the money would
make him sick afterwards. I told him that we were not interested in his
students, but that wo wanted to stop the NOS in their efforts to undermine
other nations and direct sabotage against the U.S. lie might not like the idea
of under-the-table dealing, but it was a real fact of: life. If it were not
for the current under-the-table conflict, the world would probably bo rushed
into a nuclear war, and he knew what that meant. What was going on in the
espionage field was actually a doterant, and that the people involved were
composed of the best minds of two worlds. I recalled his (Subject) two world
powers opinions (previously expressed by him) and asked him what he planned to
do. He could'nt return to Russia; his current future prospects in Mexico were
not too promising, and he had previously mentioned that he wanted to go to the
U.S. If its true that there are only two important powers in the world, then
he had bottor seriously consider where he wants to place his marbles. Opportunity
doesn't knock every day. and he was talking to a representative of the U.S
Government at the moment, who was making a proposition directly to him (Subject).
Subject said that that was all true; he at first wanted to return to Russia but
after sooing some things in Mexico ho realized that he could never be happy in
Russia again because of the oppressive regime and the leck of freedom. (He
cited the recent Russian invasion of the Chiecks and said that it made him sick
to see the Russians do this). He said that he was not happy in Mexico but th.+
he could live here O.K.


16
He had previously tried to 30 to the i.s. but had been turned com. In any
case, he had made friends here, and this was his life, and he has no intention
of cithen correving his friends or being an incomor. either for the 133 or 'or
their U.S. equivalent. The first person ho he to live with is. himself, and
the rellication that he is a say exacting his on friends would be encont to
mentolly ruin him, regardless of any money received. I told him that one
of our efforts is trying to beck the 1938 when they so after pocoie that t-m
out to be his friends. He can think that the (Subject) is not involved. but
that is far from the truth. He may not work for the 1933. but his associations
with them have been known for some time and that a thick file already exists
on him. I know his personally now, and like him, and if he refuses to work with
me IM, obligated to write it us that way. My superiors will later sit down
with me and ask the results, and I'll tell them that Rafael is a nice guy. honest,
sincore, and I firmly bolieve that he is completely less than his however will
not answer the question why he will not cooperate, and when it is put on paper
it will just be a cold report lacking personality, and the paper will indicate
that he might be working for the 1933 regardless of any opinions tacked on to the
bottom. In a case like this, protocol between the U.S. and Mexican Governments
require that we eventually turn over to them any reports on people in their
country who might be involved with the Russians in efforts against Mexico.
In his case, his file would be turned over to the Vexicans and then he can imagine
what could happen. By the time the Secret Service stopped harracing him, or he
wound up in jail, he would by living a miserable life. All this just for being
innocent. For this reason, and for reasons involving the fact that cs a real
person in a real world he can't afford just to sit on the middle of the fence,
he should seriously consider by proposition.


117
Subject said that when I mentioned suncled like a thrent, and the 1: it was,
it still would in make ary to to 1011 or be harrased
by the police then to cooperate. either with us or the KOS. I told him
with : said wind not a threet but a reality, and the should
the fact that I'm being Crank with him instead of trying to do what LOGINGW did,
to con him. I was only asking. I was a friend recendices whet his decision was,
and that it its "Now", then I'll do everything in my power to see that he
remains untouched and un-bottered, but that I can't geruntec anything because
a
bitticutive stricture was involved and 1 didn't have the final say. I told
him that unless everything he had told me during our previous assodition was
conplete D.S., then to h-d a duty to at least consider what 1 was asking.
(By now wo had been at this from 1700 to about 1930), Finally he asked me
what 1 would want of him. I said that I wanted him to work with me directly
against the KOS and that I had no interest in his friends or students at all.
If ho was concerned about the KOS bastards bothering his triazns, this was
his chance to helo me do something about it. We can't operate alone. No he
the intelligence. the ability and the opportunity to do a great delr and he
should involve himself. if only for the idools that he has previously expressed.
(He thought about it for a few moments and began to talk about Yunly CIENYSB).
he said that for instance CHERKES was another KOS man who had apronced him
to reoort on Americans. LOGLION had told him that he (LOGINOY) could'at get along
with Americans and consequently was only interested in working with Nexions. but
CHERKES tried to recruit Subject to work against Americans. Subject refused.
CHERKES however was trying to work on ADRREA (Subjects friend) and this made
him damned med. The girl ANDREA was only about 16 or 17, and a sevct little girl,
and they (KGB) had no business trying to pick on her: Subject said th-t he
was in the Plaza hotel one day waiting to make a shone call, and th-t he heard
the man in the phone Booth smoking Plaunt Russian. then the man for through
Subject asked him in Rusieip in the was from the inbress. The man gave his n
and said that he was theirist Secretary and asked Subject 11 his name was
11


118
The last Secretary said that he recogined theiel because he had seen his picture.
During the conversation the Scortuary asched Rafcol over to dinner th-t night and
he seccented. then Rafcel arrived, he was introduced to
severures of Griendahis which 1-tor led to the attented recruitment. In the
cennine Rafcel and introduced CERKISH to and now regorted it.
(This led into further conversation about the K32 and I asked hin about CHICHOW).
He said that he has worked for CHICHOW but that he had no ide- that CHICHOW was
K38, CHICHOW had never made any attempt to recruit him for anything. He
later mentioned that he night know: VOSKOCENTXOW by first n-mé. but could not
be sure of the last n-me. (I didn't try to describe him). Subject mentioned
other Sorits who are KG3 during - fast nowing conversation but I did not take
notes. My sim was the recruitment and I tried to keep the conversation chenolled
towards that end. During the conversation: Subject seid that at one time his
motor had confided in him that they had tried to recruit her several times in
Noscow to work against Spaniards and Latin Americans who visited. The KG3
h-d once threatened her but when she cocribed that she would consult her husband,
they told her to forget it. He said that she had known many members of the NVD.
KND and now KG3, but that she still refuses to work for them in their business.
After considerable more discussion along the same lines. Subject finally
thought a bit, and said that he would agree to vork with me on one condition
only. The condition was that I would not ask him to inform on, or work agzinst,
any of his friends or students, including CML, VENTURA or AMERA in particular,
and that if any thing should happen to him as a result of his vork for no, that
I would promise to take care of his wide and child. I agreed to his condition.
restating that =y only concern was the KG3. I said hovever th-t in the future if
I could prove to him, or convinced him, that any or his local
directly involved with the KG3 then I would exsect him to help me.


119
He said that was fair enough. He said the
he had a
Resterut nt date with LORIOU at 1030. He was to meet LOUINGY at a
Reeturent on the commer of ive RICHCHA and PULGA. He vented to know wh-t he
should do with LOUING. I told him to be very cered that he coos'nt ch-ene
his attitude one bit, and to continue for the tind, boing with LOUINOY just os
if nothing at all b-d hspond. I said the the Soviets do have a doprtment
at this he (intorupted and said "SINEROH" and grinned. I srid yes. they do
operate now end thch, and that the Soviets would not be very h-pcy to discover
that their friend h-d anything at all to do with us. I said that even though
we treat each other as gentlemen. they are capable of boing- to:gh at times.
He said not to worry. th-t he was an excellent actor, and LOUINOY would never
suspect a thing.
During the time I was trying to convince him, he said that I ves
forgetting one thing. He assured me that he was 80c Socialist and 20% capitalist.
and he firmly believed that Socialism was good for some countries. including
Russie. He said that because o: thet ho didn't see how I could ever have any
confidence in him: I answered by saying that everyone wes entitled to their
ideals, and I too boloved in certain forms o: Social-lism. The encouraging thing
was that he bolieved in something, and that was his right as an individual.
We in the U.S are entitled to our beliefs, and are not restricted in our reading
matter or what we said on street corners. If he wanted to, he could stand on
the steps of the Lincoln momentum and give a speech on socialism and no one
would bother him provided he didn't cause a riot, disturb the need or breok some
local law. We have Socialists who are still good citizens. He then tolked
a little about the restrictions in Russie in reading matter and talking. but
saw my point.
by 2115 we wore in agreement on his cooperation with no involving
the above mentioned conditions. I asked him to meet me on Wednesday, 5 febrtery,
at 3030 at CHALUPAS Restaurant on Reforma (just across the Porlcriro). He
know where it was and agreed to neet mo. I cautioned him ecain to be very corerul
in his dealings with LOUINOY and to take precauticent it. He cano to the meeting.


120
just prior to receiving the reteurant he and the
was going out and get drunk. (I don't recuater whre he said he was going,
but it might have been CCLS). in curcending him, he the sit: the
vould not say a word, even to his mother or wie. to let the restau-nt
at 212. no ventd to give me a ride, or have no go get drunk with him, but
I said that oven though I wouldn't mind it, that throe o: yv escostates were
waiting about three blocks away for yv reseut, and that I had to toll them
what -pocned they were very anxious about this. he parted in the doovery
and he drape off as I walked in the other direction. I letter caught a cab to
town and le: it in the vicinity of my car.
RIMARKS:
During the convorzation Subject mentioned the nases o: various
Soviets, but I was not taking notes and precirred to channel the conversion
Risst
back to the recruitment pitch. I thought the details could be obtained later
17 he was recruited.
During the pitch the only one who was nervous was me. Subjoct displayed
a "cool" which was amazing. then I presented my credentials and the pitch he
never batted an eyelashi. just continued slightly sniling. I noted no reaction
at all. It could be that he still thought I was kidding, or playing sone gome.
In any case, oither he works for the other side, or ho is indeed cool to an
admirable point.
No (I) talked from 1700 to about 2030 without raking any herdway.
Up until that time I had gotten an emphatic "NO". I almost gave up be'ore
another approach produced a little result. I think that prior assessments which

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/Cuba
FROM
: C/IC
SUBJECT
: LIREALM-1°6 Soviet Contacts at the French Club
1. Without encouraging any further contact between LIREALM-1
and the Soviets but simply taking advantage of the fact that he
does continue to see them. I would appreciate continuing information
on the following points:
a. Anything now learned about the activities of LOGINOV
and CHERNISH, even the fact that they were at the club for
certain hours on certain dates, with whom they played tennis
or talked, etc.
b. Any indications that either LOGINOV or CHERNISH have
any interest in anyone at the club.
c. Continuing assessment and biographic data on Gloria
PINTO and her husband with the view of approaching both or
either.
2. I would also appreciate a detailed assessment of LOGINOV
based on the relationship to date. The same for CHERNISH.
3. As KGB officers both are of priority interest.

2. During the past month, Subject was ill with find and,
following recovery, spent all of his time on business matters
rather than on subjects of operational interest. As usual, he is
up to his ears in financial woes, though he just discovered that
his position is not nearly as bad as he thought.
3. Subject said he thinks Polish Ambassador KARCHRZAK
may come to visit him in Cuernavaca this Sunday, though plans are
not definite. I urged him again to get busy courting KAJ. a bit
mordaggressively and not to let the relationship grow cold.
Subject said that the reason he has not been more active lately
is that Lolita is in the early months of pregnancy and has not
been feeling up to any large-scale entertaining.
4. Yectorday afternoon, 21 January, Subject ran into
Valentin LOGINOV & Florencia and Hamburgo. They exchanged brief
greetings and LOGINOV commented "We have had a very good beginning
of the year." (whatever that means). P-997
5. Subject recently received a post card from BEWEE
advising that BEWEEP has-seen Subject's sister in Warsaw. Nothing
more than this other than routine greetings.
6. Subject said that haj secretary has been looking for an

you speak English". LOGINOV stared at her icily, but did not comment
in either Spanish or English. LOGINOV spoke briefly with L/1 inquiring
what L/1's duties were with the newspaper and gave every indication that
he was unaware of L/1's column. Mrs. LOGINOV was quite cordial and
inquired if L/2 had been to the film festival in Acapulco. L/2 replied
that she had not to which Mrs. LOIGINOV countered by remarking that she
had seen L/2's friends - the SARATOVS (P-13125)- at Acapulco. L/2 stated
that no effort was made to involve the LOGINOV's in polemics during the
evening and that LOIGINOV did not appear to know the majority of the
approximate 16 guests who represented almost every nationality. The
LIRCEN'S wern the only Americans with the exception of Edward KENTRODY

GIORE'S FEELING AROUT THE US. I believe that Gloria
is less anti-American than the average middle-class Jourcian.
She has travelled to the US many times for vacations and
shopping. She knows the 137 rather well, but she goes not
cosm or
SECURITY or CLOURA. I am convinced that she
would now agree to vork for the U.S.A. the might consider
the 137.444 false-flore "exclan" it she were toto
that Val had a very good way to the same business
schnichare and, supplyine arms and money to the
student airtators, for example. ver-ultimate objectives
are not clear in my mind. I doubt then she could ever
be able to get the most important to ducto to Hancio. P am sure
She could never recruit the 135 an agent of Sevino. It
was seen nonsible that she is not a subject to out him
to reveal his disacopointments and in viveness-inforation
which might be of value to us.
and U. 10 is the moment I have insufficient
information about the pints to propara a complete P30 I
or II. it is deemed or interest, we could exchange
invictious during the next few weeks in orcar to ontein
the necessary information.

In the criteria and their charge ho would was told with
Valonie and good that this is the department you must

Later I saw Touri with his wife and son. She is rather

appeared to bo Mexicans - a large number of them clad in thoir every-
day clothes. Thera was also a sprinkling of Mexican student-appearing
types. For the record, L/1 reported that his automobile is a 1965
blue, two-door, Oldsmobile bearing Oklahoma licenso platoa, ZS-8546
(1968 plates).
3. With reference to SARATOV's party on the evening of 13 November,
L/1 commented that he and L/2 arrived at the party at approximately
2000 remaining until ca. 0030, 14 November. The LIROBBINS were the
last to leave although they departed only minutes after the rest of the
guests. The guest list included: The LIROBBINS, Arnold Bilgore and
wife JoAnne, Roger CUDIEY (Radio VIP) and wife, and the Saratovs
English was the common language spoken and L/1 noted that both the
Saratovs handled the language with ease although as the evening progressed
ar 1 SARATOV'd liquor consumption increased his fluency and articulation
became more labored. L/1 stated that SARATOV pushed liquor very hard
the entire evening starting out with two pre-dinner drinks andthen
serving vodka in accompaniement to the borsch. Wine was served with the
main course, Chinese beef, prepared by Nataliya SARATOVA. Dessert was
accompanied with brandy and the evening progressed with long drinks after
dinner. L/1 stated that SARATOV drank with the group al though L/1 doubted
that SARATOV matched the men drink for drink. Mrs. SARATOVA appeared
at ease and seemed to enjoy the conversation. L/1 assessed her as a
woman who complemented her husband and made a charming and vivacious
appearance. L/1 seemed to be struck with SARATOV's apparent"sincerity"
in its his enjoyment of the evening and his "candor" in the discussions.
For the most part, the conversation edged away from any controversial
subjects; seemingly all were content to dwell upon "Old Mexico" of 20
years ago and the joys of simple living in the city. During a dissonion
of the style of night life in Noxico, SARATOV remarked that he enjoyed

if he vould journey there and SARATOV stated that he and his wife planned
to attend.
4. LIROBIN/1 stated that during a recent conversation which he
had with Stratford JONES (US citizen representing AP in Mexico), JONES
commented that he knew both SARATOV and SYCHEV. JONES remarked that
he had been to a party at SYCHEV's during the Olympics. NECT - Further-
more, JONES related that he knew the NUCHEROV's (TASS) and that Mrs.
XUCHEROV had been sent home bofore the departure of KUCHEROV.
JONES strongly implied that security reasons wore behind the rather
abrupt departure of Mrs. KUCHEROV: L/1 did not press the issue any
further.
5. LIROBIN/1 also reported that the Foreign Press Club in in a
chaotic state in that the president, Jose QUIROGA has accused the club
director, Katharine MANARUZ, of embezzling funds. The truth of the
matter, however, seems to be that QUIROGA is engaged in either shady
dealing or is. guilty of sloppy administration of finances. At any rate,
L/1 commented that all members must pay cash for all services and that
the club's creditors are pushing fur cash payments of all services. The
"scandal" seems to have shaken the Club and many members are staying
away until the financial situation is corrected.
6. The undersigned inquired of L/1 as to whether he knew of any
US citizens who might be looking for an apartment. L/1 stated that KX
he was currently unaware of anyone desiring housing but that he would
keep his cars open and make a few discreet inquiries without reveaing
that he knows of any vacancies.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DC/IC/SB
VIA
: Chief of Station
C/IC
SUBJECT
:
Consular Corps Visit to Veracruz
1. The undersigned visited Veracruz on 9 and 10 November
together with other members of the Consular Corps of
official visit to that city. Although the Cubans were
scheduled to attend and official diplomas proclaiming them
guests of the City of Veracruz were prepared, none of them
showed up, including Lino SALAZAR Chia, who is stationed in
Veracruz. The Czechs, East Germans, and Poles for a number
of reasons also failed to go on this trip. Thus, the only
villages of the City of Veracruz were the Virginia Reserve
with whom the undersigned had been in the community to talk.
It seems that LOGIONV, at least for public consumption,
considers the undersigned "his friend." LOGINOV was accompa-
nied by his wife,
2. The following were the main points of interest
discussed by LOGINOV:
a. The Soviet appeared very anxious to get
the undersigned's opinion on a subject to which he
kept going back time and again during the visit:
b. The Soviet has been the most important distinction
vis-a-vis Communist China. Specifically, what
LOGINOV wanted to know was what the chances are
that the NIXON administration might attempt to bring
about a rapprochement between Communist China and
the United States. The Soviet has been the most
from various directions, and the undersigned did
the distinct impression that he had received a
specific query on this subject. At one point,
LOGINOV stressed the importance of Communist China
to his country, indicating that his government is
becoming increasingly concerned with developments
there.
S E C R E T
(1.1

S E C R E T

b. Connected with the above was LOCINOV's
concern for peace in Vietnam. For the first time
that the undersigned can remember, a Soviet stated
that the United States and his country had "a
common interest of utmost importance" in bringing
peace to Vietnam. That the Soviet interest may
be a major threat to the war of the war. This
China was indicated by LOGINOV when the latter
indicated that peace should be obtained in Vietnam
as a way to keep out the Chinese Communists.
This did not prevent LOGINOV from making the usual
noises in favor of the National Liberation Front
and the Vietcong, blasting away at South Vietnamese
ministries.
c. While talking about the Middle East,
LOGINOV said that the Soviet Union was in the
Mediterranean to stay and fully intended to give
such support to the Arab nations in that area as
a result of the war of the world. This was generally
stated, "The Jews have it coming to them, and the
day of reckoning is coming." The undersigned was
curious to know whether this was prompted on
the world. The world was not a major part of an
anti-Semitic feeling. LOGINOV was quite blunt and
categorically stated that he for one "hated all
Jews," and did not hide his profound anti-Semitism.
The world was not a major threat to the world
little nationalism other than that generated by the
Zionist cause. He implied that those Jews left in
the Soviet Union are foreigners who have done little
in the world. The United States of the United
out that anti-Semitism has been the undersigned
tradition, dating back to before the Revolution,
and deplored this obvious discrimination. He added
that this reminded him of the anti-Semitism of the
party which not so long ago made mass murder of
Jews and the Jews.
d. It took LOGINOV about one day to bring up
the Sucesos para Todos article. The undersigned
jokingly asked him whether this was a Soviet or
Cuban sponsored joke, saying that rumor had it that
Sucesos was financed by both the Soviets and the
S E C R E T

Cubans. LOGINOV denied this, saying that the staff
of Successos could not be put by any stretch of the
imagination into the category of "Communists." He
then point-blank asked the undersigned whether he
belonged to the organization mentioned in the
following section. He said, "he said, "he said that
if such trashy publications as Successos were believed
by anyone "of course he belonged to that organization."
LOGINOV laughed and made a few more noises about how
Successos obtained the undersigned's name. The latter
was the same as the "Cochoslovakia" and "The
random from stolen pages of the Embassy directory
or other such document. He added that if LOGINOV
had wanted his phone number he would have been glad
to have given it to him rather than see it appear
in Successos.
The one discussion the undersigned had with
LOGINOV in Guadalajara about the KGB was apparently
not forgotten by the Soviet, for the latter pulled
out of his purse a copy of the stamp commemorating
some KGB anniversary that the undersigned had
mentioned to him. The undersigned has no idea of
the "Cochoslovakia" and "The undersigned has
which seems to embarrass LOGINOV the most is the
number of visas he signs at the Soviet Embassy.
Whenever LOGINOV gets a little too pointed in his
provocations, the undersigned raises this subject,
with LOGINOV invariably giving a little laugh and
no answer.
LOGINOV indicated that he was aware that
the undersigned had met with Jiri SVESTKA at the
time of the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia
and asked for his opinion of SVESTKA. The undersigned
made no bones about the fact that he had a long lunch
and he had been left to be left. He said, "he said,
de la izquierda," adding that unfortunately SVESTKA
belonged to the very small minority of his country
which had welcomed Soviet intervention. The under-
signed predicted that the Soviets would have con-
siderable trouble with Czechoslovakia and pointed
out that this serious error had tarnished the cause

of the Soviet Union. He said, for example, that
the Soviet intervention was very unpopular in Mexico.
This seemed to draw a little blood from LOGINOV, as
he abruptly interrupted the undersigned and asked,
"Where is it popular?"

SUBJECT: Julio PLATAS Urbina, born 10 Cctober 1941 in Npalme,
Sonora
1. It has come to our attention that Julio PLATAS Urbina,
an agent of the Soviet KGB, is presently living in Bacobampo,
Sonora. PLATAS has been known to us since 1961, when he was in
contact with Alkoshandor BROVKIN, a KGB officer who was then
and still is attached to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City as
a Third Secretary. In 1965, PLATAS was in contact with Valentin
LGGTNOV, a KGB officer who is a Third Secretary and Consul of
the Soviet Union.
The exact nature of PLATAS's KGB assignments is unknown
to us, but he is believed to be a courier, carrying both money
and drugs in behalf of the KGB. His courier duties are also
believed to have brought him in contact with the Communist Party
of Mexico.
3. PLATAS is believed to have traveled considerably through-
out Latin America, and is known to have been in Argentina and
Great Britain in 1967. According to our information, he has just
received a new assignment, a courier mission which may begin as
early as 1 August 1968.
4. We would appreciate receiving the results of your inter-
rogation of PLAT.S particularly since he is alleged to have
knowledge of Soviet attempts to recruit personnel of the U.S.
Embassy in Mexico.

Manuscripts of "General" Narton SLOTHS
Just after 5100 PM last Friday. So, Hightons were
previously unknown to me but who calling card indicates
that he is employed by the housework Prave Company here,
brought to the Prove of the House and Welfare Office a blue canvas
of the Housework book-length manuscripts. Sr. Gomez
started that he had found the bug containing the manuscripts in
the elevator of the office building in which he works, even
Referons No. 308, opposite the Ehrnazy. The program was
imprent as to the inclusion of the author, as well as who
it might have been the half left there in the elevator. He
had contrived them briefly, he said, and then decided that
they are completely to be brought to the Embassy.
One merchand cover sheets of both manuscripts identified
the author as Norton Slone, and one of these showed his
address to be "General" Horton Glone, c/o Ir. J. Ellsworth, and
Chief of the F.B.I., Pa. 1971, published in the Washington
University of Maryland. Edited "Overdols along the Shore," and
"Koctman - Folklore of the Inca. A cursory examination of
the former revealed a cluncy hnte theme, churgist minority
groups in the United States with selling out to the communities.
This latter was apparently a romantic treatment in novel fore
of Pizarro's conquest of Results

him there. Subject said that DAINA has tried to be friendly
with him for several years and has many times invited Subject and
his wife to his home. Subject said he has never liked DALMA,
however, and has always found a way out of the invitations.
One reason he didn't like DALMA, Subject said, was that he always
seemed to have something good to say about Communist Hungary,
About nine months ago, DALMA toct a trip to Hungary, and whenever
Subject has seen him since then. he has made a point of telling
Subject how good conditions are in Hungary and how happy everyone
is there. Subject said he thought we should therefore have the
fellow's name in our files.
5. BESABER'S PERSONAL LIFE. In late March, Subject told me
about a woman he had met on a business trip to New York earlier
in the month. Her name is Vella SANCHEZ Belmont, Mexican citizen,
age approximately 33. Subject happened to sit next to her on the,
flight to New York, struck up a conversation, and ultimately
spent a few nights with her in New York.
6. Subject told me that Vella was once married to an
American singer, but had been divorced and subsequently become
the mistress of Julian RODRIGUEZ Adame, a former Mexican
Secretary of Agriculture (under LOFEZ Mateos) and currently the
President of the International Cotton Association. Subject said
that through RODRIGUEZ Adame, Vella had gotten to know many of
the top people in the PRI and had become particularly friendly with
the wife of Alfonso MARTINEZ Dominuez, the new head of the
PRI. Subject said that Vella had become fairly wealthy as the
result of her influential contacts and now owned an apartment


in New York City, a house in Mexico City, and a second house
in Acapulco, where she also had a sizable piece of undeveloped
Land. Subject described Vella as both extremely intelligent
and a tremendous sexual partner, and speculated that because of
her excellent political contacts, she might from time to time be
able to provide some interesting information on the Mexican
political scene.
7. I was in Acapulco on 6 and 7 April, and at Subject's
invitation spent the afternoon of 7 April with him and Vella
on the beach at the Pierre Marques Hotel. Subject introduced me
(by phony name) as a business contact from the States, and I had
the opportunity to talk with Vella at intervals throughout the
afternoon. As Subject told me, she is attractive, well-built,
intelligent, polished, very sharp, and evidently very shrewd.
She also speaks very good English. She told me she had just
returned two days aro from a shopping trip to New York with the
wife of MARTINEZ Dominguez. She said the señora is really just
a country woman and had asked her to go with her to New York to
help her pick out a new wardrobe, which she needed for her new
role as the wife of the leader of the PRI. We later drove to
Vilia's house for a drink, and from its size and location
(overlooking the bay between the socale and the Caleta Hctel, it
would indeed appear she had a considerable amount of money.
8. On 3 June, Subject told me that his romance with Vella
had gotten out of hand, as she was extremely demanding and
possessive and wanted him to divorce his wife and marry her.
The problem, Subject said, was that he felt just strongly enoukh


about her that he couldn't just dismiss the idea. Moreover, his
wife had learned about Vellia, and althouch she was accustomed to
Subject's philanderinz, she recognized that Vellia was a little
different from Subject's other girl friends and was extremely
upset. Subject asked my opinion and advice, and for what it
was worth, I told him I thought he was crazy to even think of
breaking up his family and his marriage with a woman whom he
claimed to still love and who was tolerant to the point that
Subject was able to have both her and all the routine extra-
curricular activity he wanted at the same time. I pointed out
that this certainly wouldn't be the case with Vellia, who would
probably poison him if he even looked at another woman. After
batting this around for some time, Subject finally said he
agreed with me and that if he couldn't simply keep Vellia on
the string, he'd have no choice but to drop her. This is
hardly to say, however, that this is what Subject will do, and
I suspect V. lia will continue to disrupt Subject's personal life
for some time to come.
9. As for our possible use of Vellia--and she does seem to
have the credentials to be one of the great female spies--there
are clearly two considerations which should be mentioned. First,
any attempt to use Subject in her exploitation (at least at this
point) would further complicate his relations with her and
presumably further disrupt his personal life. Second, based on
what I know about her from Subject and from personal contact, I
am afraid that if we did succeed in recruiting her for whatever


19
purpose, we would sooner or later find that we had a genuine
Mexican tigra by the tail.

deported to the United States. The undersigned kept a
reduction of the United States. The United States has been
about it. CICARD protested that news of the arrests and
deportation had reached the press. The undersigned told him
that he had seen nothing of the sort. CICARD then went on
to blame the incident on the American Embassy, which, he said,
the United States, was not the most important. The
pointed out that the Embassy had other things to do than to
concern itself with, according to CICARD's own description,
beattink-type students. This was, in any case, a Mexican

other beantias of all nationalities. During a rather heated
exchange the previous night in which Yuriy S. CHERNYSH and
Jiri SPECTRA were also present. CICARD was a very

were not the most important. The United States, who had

CICARD also bonored of the moral necessity for the Cubans to
help free Latin Americans from the crude of misery and

the mensalves in that country and the other people had
the same sense of the question. When, warned him that any effort
in Mexico was doomed, as the Cubans would get nowhere in that
country even if they tried. At another point of the visit

over his shoulder, SALAZAR scribbled something on the paper
which he handed CHEM. and the American Association
was a very great situation, Reynoldo CEPEDA Hornandez and
his wife arrived at the Hilton, where they were eventually
introduced to the undersigned by CICARD as "our First Secretary."
The undersigned lacer asked CICARD What CEPEDA was doing there
to be a very good idea that the American Association was
no consulate in Guadalajara. With a broad smile CICARD said
he was on "vacation." At one point of the visit, the bus
used by the group left without the undersigned, the Cubans,
and the representative of Ecuador and his wife. It was agreed
to be a very good idea that the American Association was
some 25 kilometers away, by taxi, if the taxi could not first
locate the bus in the city. The bus was not located, and the
little group proceeded to Chapala, where to the undersigned's
amazement CICARD paid for the entire taxi trip and refused
money from the others.
3. Lino SALAZAR is undoubtedly ono of the most uncouth,
vulgar, and all-around uneducated men the undersigned has
ever met. A light mulatto, SALAZAR spucks with such a heavy

Nogro-type accent that it is almost impossible to understand
him. As a matter of fact, both LOUINOV and CHERVSHI told
the undersigned that the latter seemed to understand SALAZAR
for octer than they did. At every possible reason he could
squeeze in some communica, the fact that the fact that
the fact that the most first it was relevant to the conversation
and the moment or not. He tried to embarrass the wife of the
South Korean representative who was with the group by asking
her whotier every Korzan woman kind a wart over the
she did. Fortunately, he said. He said. He was representative
who was with the manisa and hardly any English, and the
undersigned just would not translate. He also. in her presence,
launched into a tirade about South Korea, which the undersigned
cut of by telling him that he didn't have to be a striking
tobacco industry. He said. He said. He is bottom of the barrel as
the
tar as nations were concerned. SALAZAR said that in Verancruz
the Americans avoided him, but that this was all right with
him since he had no business with them.

Bev of Pigs he would be very surprised. Both SALAZAR and
CICARD on several occasions blasted Cuban exiles in the United
States, saying that they were men without the same kind.
But the fact that the fact that the President has undersigned

a dime, had given a very good accounting of themselves in the

this: LIEENO-1, incidentally, has pointed out in his reports
that SALMAN is extremely active in Voronoz and that he has
the air of someone important in the city council as well as
others. The general commanding the area, who is a source of
LIRENO-1, has been looking for a chance to have SALAZAR
deported. This Section will see what it can do to oblige him.
2. There was no doubt from LOGIOV's statements to the
undersigned that the Soviet had made at least some mental
notes before he went on the trip about subjects he should
raseo with the undersigned. Vietnam, of course, was profusely
discussed, but LOGIOV also wanted to be the most common
of the world. He said he said he decided States and about the
March of the Poor on Washington. One afternoon that LOGIOV
was with CIERNYSH, the undersigned told him that he could not
inagine how the Soviets could favor the candidacy of Bobby
LIEENO-1, who was a very good man who was a very good
with his hands and was liberally spending the family fortune
to influence people's minds, when
the
was far more to the left in the American political spectrum
of the world. He said he said he said he said he said he said
what the undersigned said, the Soviets found something good
to say about KENNEDY, who appears to be the candidate the
Soviet Union would most like to see as the next President.
The two Soviets laughingly remarked that the undersigned's
societies were the most important, but he was a very good
The undersigned said that fortunately the American Government
was not at the mercy of the prevailing winds as were the
governments of "other countries." The manner in which LOGIOV
was the most important, but he said he said he said he said
nursing. For example, on the way to Guadalajara, when the
undersigned and LOGIOV were alone in the corridor of their
coach, LOGIOV mentioned the armistice negotiations in Vietnam.
The undersigned, as he has done many times in the past.
He said he said he said he said he said he said he said he said
not be thrown away, as a backdown in negotiations might increase
the tempo of the war to the point where a much larger conflict
could result. LOGIOV agreed that no one, including his
country, wanted such a conflict and indeed a maximum effort
should be made to find people to be able to be able to
conform the possible speed on the Soviets, as the latter
obvious. He said some influence over the corth Vitcannese govern-
ment. He then said that peace was possible providing that

two main conditions were not. At that point someone came by
and interrurged the conversation for a good two or three
minutes. Rather than renew the argument he could see LOGINV
tanted to develop, the undersigned started to talk about the
cattle in the fields, Mexican agriculture, et cotera. LOGINV
listened to this for one or two minutes and then reminded
that the new business is a major challenge for the business
the armistice. The undersigned said that the primary condition
for peace was for North Vietnam to pull out all of its troops
from South Vietnam. Before he could mention the second
condition, someone again interrupted the conversation, handed
with the same time, he said. The number of days of the
five minutes. After his departure, the undersigned again
talked about something else, but again LOGINV, after one or
two minutes, doggedly went back to the original discussion
of the fact that the same time was the same time. For
signed then told him that this condition was that really free
elections be held in South Vietnam. About half an hour later,
LOGINV opened up on the March of the Poor, whereupon the
understanding of the same time was the same time. The News
undetorid Report listing the salaries of various workers in
the United States. Electricians, for example, are listed as
making $7.50 an hour. In short, the undersigned pointed out,
to be really poor in the United States takes a lot of doing,
the same time was the same time. The hours of the year
States could do as the Soviets do and send people without a
desire to work or the will to assume responsibility to re-
eduction camps in Siberia and elsewhere. LOGINV confirmed,
the same time was the same time. The hours of the evening.
LOGINV also touched upon the search for the assassin of
Martin Luther KING, whereupon the undersigned told him that
the United States lacked the regimentation of the Soviet Union
and the heavy state controls over the population so that ft-
ter of the German, but the German, and the German, was
than 200,000,000 people in one or two days. He also told
LOGINV that it remained to be seen who put the assassin up
to his act. The undersigned, of course, mentioned that the
assassination was an abominable deed, as KING was probably
reached in the same time. The German, who was a man who
the white extremists, as LOGINV called them, been behind the
assassination, it is probable that Stokeye CARNICIAEL or
Rap BCIHN would have been shot. During the ride on the bus-
and cut of the clear blue, LOGINV asked the undersigned

whether he had met J. Edgar ROOYER. The undersigned said he
had not. LOGINOV then said that he was a bucholor. The
undersigned said that if he was it was probably because in
his 40 years as hand of the FBI he had had an awfully lot to
be the most common thing. He said that he was a
chocurably respected organization in the United States which
had the support of the people. LOGINOV then switched to the
CIA, but the undersigned told him that unlike the FBI, on
which quite a bit was known to the American people, very little
than the other people. He said that he was a very important
the periodic changes at the holn of the CIA and dropped the
subject. A somewhat similar conversation occurred a little
later between the undersigned, LOGINOV, and CHERNYSII when
unexpectedly LOGINOV and the other people. He said that
he was a very important protection of the Soviet people and the
Constitution. The undersigned asked LOGINOV for a sample of

was a young one and on occasion claimed to know more than
those who have been purifying Communism for 50 years and
more. The undersigned joked about the fact that the Soviet
Ullon would have to give the Cabans petroleum free if the
sugar crop this year was as bad as it appeared to be. LOGINOV
had a significant increase in the production of tobacco.
S. The undersigned, who has already had the feeling that
Jiri SVESTKA apes the Soviets, copies their line, and mimics
their comportment, had confirmation of all this during the
trip. SVESTKA was one of the first to raise the topic of
Vietnan and pour oil over the fire. During dinner in the
dining car on the way to Guadalajara, where he sat with the
sugar crop. The undersigned, who had previously told the Russians
came up. The undersigned, who had previously told the Russians
that he served for a brief time with that army, said that he
had great admiration for the military fects of the Russians.
The undersigned was a very good, but he was a very good, but
The undersigned then gave SVESTKA a short refresher course
in what had happened in Warsaw in 1920 or 1921, when a Franco-
Prussian army led by Gen. Maxime WEYGAND and Gen. Jozef
PILSTDSKI boat an invading Soviet army, which has been
reached in the 1930s. The Ullon's 1930s was a 1930s. SVESTKA tried
to dispute the fact that this took place, whereupon the under-
signed offered to buy him a history book. That seemed to
pre' ont SVESTKA from making any other expeditions into history
of the United States. The United States was a 1930s. The
with the Czech, Soviets, and Cubans were on extremely friendly
terms, in spite of their pointedness it times. During the
night of 18 May, during the train trip back to Mexico City,
a particularly heated discussion took place in a compartment
and a 1930s. The United States was a 1930s. The United States
discussion will be reviewed in the next paragraph. Suffice
it to say that at one point SVESTKA intervened in the defense
of CHERNSHI to say something about how indebted Czechoslovakia
was a 1930s. The United States was a 1930s. The United
had not been the decision of President Franklin D. ROOSSETL,
at the urging, apparently, of STALIN, to stop the advance of
the United States any into Czechoslovakia to allow the
Russians to liberate Prague, the amnistice would not have,
found Soviet troops occupying Czechoslovakia, and "things
might have been completely different for the Czech nation."
When SVESTKA included to be bewildered by this statement, the

undersigned even more blandly asked him if he meant to say
that Czechoslovakia would have become a Communist power had
the Soviet armies not occupied the country by the end of the
War. SVESTNA said that there was no doubt about this, that
the coming of the Communist government, and the President
had been the most important the historical and social background
of the Czechs. The undersigned expressed horror at a statement
liku this, which did not take into consideration the fact
that such anti-Communists as Jan MABARYK and Eduard BENES
were the fathers of the American American Medical Center to
determine the other MABARYK nor BEVES had been Communist,
but that neither had any deep knowledge of the inborn desires
of the Czech people. The undersigned told him that this
was enough to make both MABARYK and BENES turn over in their
society. He was a member of the American Medical Center, where
according to the Mexican press, between the Czech and Soviet
papers over MABARYK, with the Russians saying that MABARYK
had participated in an attempt to kill Mikolai LENN. CheraVSH

the
ESTXA looked agiaty unhappy about sound money. It was
to the undersigned that, as mentioned above, the
visious night's discussion had really shaken up the Czech,
who was worrying about how things would turn out in Czecho-
slovakia and about his future. SVESTKA, as a matter of fact,
the point of view of the when he saw him a few minutes
later that he had felt that it was a very good reason for
discussion had been conducted in what he phrased as a rather
cool atmosphere. This feeling was obviously not shared by
CHEMISH, despite the heat of the discussion, who warmly
granted the undersigned the next morning, and unless the
undersigned is very much mistaken, appeared to have a sort of
tracing from the next.
The undersigned finds CHERNSH a fairly easy man to
talk to. Not that CHERNSH is not a dedicated Communist, but
he seems to enjoy a good discussion, probably because he
finds this a good opportunity to pass on typical Communist
and the Communist Association the night of 18 May mentioned
above, during which the Communist Board of Congress, the
the Ukrainian and the undersigned had previously discussu.
such things as Western-style injections and the right to strike.
On both topics CHERNSYSH obviously was not on the same wave
of the industry. He said, "The Communist Party was a stace-
ments to the effect that a strike was unnecessary in a variety
deciduted to the well-being of the workers. It would only
criple an economy struggling hard to meet local demands. On
the subject of elections CHERNSYSH was even further away from
the war. The industry was a very good reason for the
perhaps the undersigned, did not have any particular liking
for any of the candidates for presidential elections. This
made the element of choice a very marginal benefit, if benefit
is not a very strong, but it is not a very strong, but it is
inside the government where these men could be thoroughly
tested and screened was a much better prospect. The under-
signed naturally explained at length that, according to the
old cliche, "variety is the spice of life," and that choice
is a born right. The undersigned said that he would never be
a good example. I place where he could : : pick his close
friends, his family economics, or the wopio scheduled to
recresen him in the republic. that seemed to make no dent

in all of CHENYSEST's arguments. The undersigned scored a
little more during the previously mentioned discussion during
the night of is May. He then had a becor chance to compare
the American Constitution with the Soviet one, underscoring
the elements of centralism and curts on personal choice.
The discussion of the role of the Russians in World War II
permitted his question of whether the Russians had fought for
their country or for their regime. The undersigned told
the President of the United States. The United States War
had :- to doubt in his mind that the latter had fought for
their country and families first, and much later to back up
their regime, Both SVESKA and CHEENYSH naturally argued with
the United States. The SVESKA, who at the can be more pro-
Soviet than the Soviets. The United States was not the Greens
to like the undersigned's company, and the farewell between
him and the undersigned at the station in Mexico City appeared
to be particularly warn. This, of course, is not viewed by
the Chans on SVESTKA with a particularly good eye.

in the open letter was not only a blunder on the part of
Ambassador FREEMAN, but also indicative of the superiority
complex of the United States. At one point, when Valentin
LOGINOV had joined in the discussion, the undersigned retorted
the 1970s, and the written that article was a fourth-class
writer without a dime in the 1970s. When the thousands of
pesos nocossary to place his editorial, the 1970s had
the Russian laughed, the undersigned continued that if the
Soviet Union wanted to give money to the Mexican Communist
Union, the President, was a sales主办 to the local members
of socialist countries, it was a major role in the 1970s.
This is just about all it could hope to achieve. SVESTKA
and LOGINOV naturally denied that their countries had anything
in the 1970s. The Communist Party, not to speak of the
overt letter on the Ambassador FREEMAN, was a strong tongue in
cheek, thon pointed out that he was glad to tell the 1970s.
their information that a Communist Party did exist in Mexico.
The 1970s, interesting reaction of SVESTKA came towards
the end of the parrot of the 1970s. The 1970s, he was
During a discussion which included SVESTKA, LOGINOV, one of
the Soviet military attaches (a tall colonel with white hair),
another Russian, and a youngish, short, and chubby member of
the 1970s. He was a member of the undersigned expressed a
thought that the two systems of the 1970s were not part and
the soviot, were gradually inching closer together. When
SVESTKA allowed himself to doubt it with a nasty little laugh
and a very aggressive, he was could not resist telling him to
have a look at what was the 1970s. He was the reaction
of SVESTKA was both immediate and noticeable. He was
straightened out, jerked his head back, opened his mouth,
and the 1970s of his cigar on the floor, and obviously
bit his tongue as the 1970s from the above and from
the fact that SVESTKA plans to drive the 1970s.
Association meeting in Guadalajara with his Soviet colleagues,
the undersigned feels that SVESTKA is not only a lackey of the
1970s. He was but very probably in the employ of the
Soviet KGB. He seems to be inseparable from LOGINOV and has
lately. mouthed the same provocations in the same techniques,
showing himself more and more aggressive, a thing which he
was not a year ago

3. Among other nasty little remarks made by LOGINOV,
including references to the open letter against the Ambassador,
the war in Viotnam, the Negro problem, the difficult financial
position of the dollar, et cetera, was a reference to this
Station. LOGINOV at one point asked the undersigned where
he worked (not the first time he has asked this) The under-
standing of the first time he has asked his first time for his
Office. LOGINOV then said, "What about the fifth floor?"
The undersigned told him that the fifth floor comprised both
the Anabassador's Office and the Political Section. LOGINOV
was a first time for his office. The first time for his office,
but what about the other offices, those occupied by WOFIRMP"
The undersigned let that one go by as LOGINOV had obviously
found it very funny. He proceeded to pay back the Soviets a
little later by counting on his fingers the number of visas
and the other figures. He was a first time for his office. The natural
exchanges handled by the Embassy staff, and "all the work
done for trade promotion with Mexico." The undersigned felt
tha the Soviets probably issued some five visas. a month, if
thac many, had about ten cultural exchanges a year, and had
been the most important the Mexicans. What, thon, he asked,
were the 40 odd "diplomn" in the Soviet Embassy doing in
Mexico? LOGINOV laughed, but the laughed green and promptly
broke off this conversation.
4. The undersigned had no opportunity to talk at any
length with Ambassador HANUS, who was very busy at the
reception. The Ambassador, how'sver, greeted him warmly and
gave him a prolonged bear hug as he left. The undersigned
had no talk with the Cubans except a few words which he
exchanged with Sergio MARTINEZ, whom he had not met before.

1.
DATES OF MEETING: 16 May 1968
1. I met Subject in his room in the Del Paseo Hotel from
1415-1630. The next meeting will be arranged by telephone.
2. LOGINOV. Subject reported that LOGINOV called him at
his factory in Guernavaca on Friday, 3 May. LOGINOV said he
had some visitors who would like to buy a few things to take
back with them to Russia and asked if it would be convenient if
he brought them down to Subject's factory on Saturday afternoon,
& May. Subject said fine and invited LOGINOV and the visitors to
8
come back to his house for a few drinks after they finished
shopping. LOGINOV gratefully accepted and said they would be
there at 1330. (Per LIENVOY--sbe attached transcript--LOGINOV
called BEWEEP on 3 May to ask for Subject's telephone number.)
3. LOGINOV arrived (in 19 DA, a dark blue Chevy) at the
factory at 1345 with three other persons:
(a) A bix. fat. plain. peasant-looking woman by the
name of "IGOROVA," "IGANOVA," or something similar. LOGINOV
introduced her as a commercial representative, but did not
elaborate.
(b) A second Russian woman whose name Subject couldn't
remember. She looked to be 33-35 years old and wore glasses.
LOGINOV did not mention her profession, and she seemed simply
to be a friend of the first woman.
CC: P-4097
P-11712


(c) The son of one of the above two women. He appeared
to be about 12 years old.
4. LUCINOV and his three companions shopped for about an
hour while Subject worked in his office, and in the end bought
450-500 pesos worth of merchandise (at wholesale prices, of
course). Subject and the four Russians then left together,
got into their respective cars; and drove to. Subject's home with
Subject leading the way. When they were driving into Subject's
driveway, Subject, in view of his wife and two children and the
four Russians, accidentally ran over and broke the back of one
of the BESABERS' beloved dachshunds. Chaos reigned for the
next ten minutes as Subject went into the house, got his pistol,
and returned and shot the dos while the children screamed, Mrs.
BESABER tried to suppress her own tears and shoo away the children
at the same time, and the four Russians sat aghast in their car
and watched. LOCINOV acted extremely sorry and did his best to
console Mrs. BESABER and Subject. Mrs. BESABER recovered quickly,
however, and soon had all the adults seated in the living room.
Subject served the first round of drinks, and within a half hour
everyone was at least reasonably relaxed again.
5. LOCINOV was the only one who did not take an alcoholic
drink. He wore dark sunglasses all afternoon and explained that
he had to stay away from liquor because he was taking antibiotics
for an eye infection. Despite this ailment and inability to
take a drink, LOCINOV was nevercheless more sociable and friendly
than Subject had ever seen him. He also struck Subject as being


more relaxed than in the past. He brought the BESABERS two
bottles of vodka and two cans of caviar, asked why Subject
hadn't called or visited him at the Embassy, addressed Subject
only as "tun" (where he had formerly mixed "tus" and "ustedts"
with Subject). enthusiastically toured the BESABERS' new house,
and patiently translated for the two Russian women, neither of
whom spoke Spanish or English. The conversation was generally
dull, however, and nothing even mildly controversial was
discussed. The Russians finally left about 1700.
6. In the course of the conversatior, Mrs. BESABER asked
LOGINOV when they were ever going to get together to play tennis.
(Mrs. BESABER had of course previously invited LOGINOV to play
tennis with her sometime at the home of a retired American
gentleman in Cuernavaca (i.e., Col. Lawrence HIGGINS) who was a
good friend and who had an exceptionally good court.) LOGINOV
replied that he still wanted very much to play, but that it was
always a question of time for him. "Why didn't LOGINOV come down
to Cuernavaca next Saturday morning (11 Mcy)? Subject interjected.
He (LOGINOV) and Mrs. BESABER could play tennis in the morning while
Subject was working, and then they could all spend the afternoon
at home relaxing. LOGINOV replied that that sounded great, but
asked what he was goinz to do with his wife and child. Mrs.
BESABER answered that of course they expected him to bring Mrs.
LOGINOV and the child with him. LOGINOV said that would be
very nice and he'd like to accept the invitation right at that
moment, but he was afraid that his schedule was such that he
was going to have to hold off on a definite answer until later
in the week. OK, said Subject, "will you call me, or shall I


94
call you?" Well, replied LOGINOV. why didn't they leave it that
if he didn't hear from Subject, he would call Subject, and
vice versa. Subject agreed.
7. Subject said he waited until Friday morning, 10 May,
to hear from LOGINOV, and when LOGINOV didn't call, he called
LOGINOV (confirmed by LIENVOT). LOGINOV, according to Subject,
said he was afraid he was not going to be able to make it, after
all, because the Mayor of Moscow was visiting Mexico and he would
be tied up with the Mayor on Saturday. Subject said he suggested
that perhaps they could make it for the following Saturday, then.
LOGINOV replied that he thought he might be able to make it then,
but, again, he couldn't say for sure just then. "But anyway,"
LOGINOV added, "we're going to be seeing each other more often
because we've (i.e., the Soviet Embassy) taken a house on Calle
Umbolt (in Cuernavaca) for the summer, and I'll be coming down
to Cuernavaca every weekend." Subject expressed pleasure at
this and said that he'd expect to hear from LOGINOV sometime
soon then. LOGINOV assured Subject he would.
8. BENEEP. BENEEP called Subject in Cuernavaca about 1400
on 10 May. He said he wanted to tell Subject that a Polish musical
group was about to open at Bellas Artes and would be playing some
of Subject's grandfather's music. (Subject's paternal grandfather
was a pupil of Franz Liszt and, according to Subject, is generally
regarded in Poland as the second greatest Polish composer next
to Chopin.) BENEEP asked if Subject was going to be in Mexico
City the following week and if he'd have time to accompany
BENTEP to Della Artes for a performance. Subject said that
unfortunately, he wouldn't be able to go, but suggested that


110
BENEEF bring the musicians to his home in Cuenravaca for an
afternoon. BEWEEP said he wasn't sure if they could work it
into their schedule, but ne'd cneck and let Subject know if they
could come. (Neither Subject nor BEWEEP said anything about the
"vacation trip" they discussed on 10 April.)

CONTACT REPORT
SUBJECT
: LIOVAL-1
DATE OF MEETING
: 30 April 1968
1. Subject called me on 29 April and wo agreed to meet at
the rostaaurant "Bocana". The meeting lasted from 14:30 to
15:40. I advanced Subject 500 MN for his Russian lessons.
Next meeting is at the Bocana at 13:45 on 17 May.
2. Subject reported that he had gone by the IICMR to
inquire about Russian lessons but was totally unimpressed. He
gave his name and tinked to the Director of Coursne whose name
he didn't get. He will write up the details for the next meeting.
3. He then contacted VIDIELLA at the last meeting.
and invited him out to discuss Rummson. Since it wasn't
not a matter of what he was asked that they bring along a
couple of the students. Odile MORISSET, a French teacher also
came along. They went to Sanborn's cocktail lounge. While
talking Sra. MORISSKT (she is divorced) invited Subject to her home
for a party and said he could spend the night with her i be
came. She gave her address as, Parie 7. Apt. 5. Subject described
how he was 143 years old. Later VIDIELLA told Subject that
HORIESTER 143 years with anybody and that he usually shacks up
with her on Fridays.
4. Subject told VIDIELLA that he had gone to the IICMR but
it looked poor. VIDIELLA agreed, saying the teachers are not
good. He did not say that he is or when he was a member of IICMR.
VIDIELLA suggested that he would be private lessons from him.
He said that he would need accreditation which he could
use for further formal study. VIDIELLA said Subject could study
with him and then take exams at the Institute which would give
him a certificate for that level. He said that he would expect
that he would have been asked. ALLLA will give Subject
private classss at Subject's afternoon school twice a week from
19:00 to 20:00 on Mondays and Wednesdays. Price will be 50 MN
per lesson. Subject paid him 400 MN in advance. The first
lesson was on 29 April. Since 1 May is a holiday Subject will
go to VIDIELLA's apt. He gave his address as Honore do Terroros
1163 apt. 1 (we had 8922, apt. 1) and telephone 400-403.

5. In the presence of all VIDIELLA boasted about his great
Soviet Friend, Valentino, the consul (this is obviously LOGIHOV).
The two students and MORISSET all seemed to know LOGIHOV personally.
One of the students asked VIDIELLA if he had been invited to the
Soviet 1 May celebration. He said that he hadn't. He then asked
that he had been asked for the same time. He said that he had
as he could that he had known one casually with whom he used to
go fishing and changed the subject. Subject didn't feel that
VIDIELLA was fishing for information but I am not so sure.
6. I briefed Subject on what to look for in his lessons
with VIDIELLA, to take short notes, and to have a written report
for our next meeting.

SUBJECT: Soviet cultivation of British Subjects
1. It has come to our attention that the Soviets, specif-
ically KGB officers, have been looking around for English language
instructors. One KGB officer, Valentin Szerzeyevich LOGINOV, is
notorious for using this tactic to assess contacts who may be of
use to hiq.
2. Among the persons in whom LOGINOV is reported to have
shown interest are two British subjects:
a. A young student, (fau) LAMREKT, who is studying for
a doctorate in literature in Mexico and who prior
to returning to Britain is giving English lessons.
b. Walter James PLUMB, Director of the Anglo-Morican
Institute.
3. It is suggested that you might wish to contact these
individuals to determine if the Soviets are indeed cultivating
them. I would appreciate receiving the results of such interviews.

kept informed to some extent about Subject through his younger
brother, Javier ARIA Buerba, from whom I have been taking
Spanish lessons since July 1967.
3. Subject was a casual contact of Station officer Olivia
C. RAGNITY in 1965 and 1966. can than a file card noting
this contact, 1'
station traces on either Jorge or
Javier ARIAS Buerba.
4. Subject and I from the beginning have had a very friendly
and informal relationship. He is an intelligent person with a
friendly, open personality and a good sense of humor. Politically,
he is pro-American to the point that he magnifies our strengths
and positive qualities and tends to minimize or overlook negative
factors in our society. Subject knows I am with the Political
Section of the Embassy and that I have been in the Soviet Union.
We have consequently gotten onto the topic of Russians and
Communism several times, and he has always come out a strong
anti-Communist. He has one brother and two sisters living in
the United States. The brother is married to an American and
lives in Virginia, where he is in the construction business.
One of the sisters is also married to an American and lives in
California (I believe San Francisco). The second sister is
married to a Polish immigrant and lives with him in Chicago.
The sister in C-lifornia is a naturalized American citizen. The
brother and the sister in Chicago are not.
5. On 24 April 1967, LIENVOY reported the following call
from GAZIYEV to LOGINOV:
GAZ: "I saw him, he arrived yesterday."
.


205
LOO: "Excellent. Then I'd like to see you to discuss
certain things."
GAZ: "Then I can come there tomorrow?"
LOG: "No, better Wednesday."
GAZ: "All right. He usually comes there at 6 o'clock.
He got married and came here with his wife. Now
they look for an apartment. I'11 go there on the
10th, because I want to attend courses in English.
This week I'll be busy."
LOG: "OK, until the next then."
6. From this conversation, it appeared that GAZIYEY was
probably talking about Subject, since:
(a) GAZIYEY had been taking Spanish at the Mexican-North
American Institute and I knew from Subject that Subject had had
GAZIYEY in one of his classes, that Subject occasionally chatted
with GAZIYEY after class, and that GAZIYEY had once given Subject
an invitation to a Consular night at the Soviet Embassy (although
Subject told me he had not gone).
(b) Subject had gotten married that month.
(c) Subject had just returned to Mexico with his birda;
(d) Subject and his wife were looking for an apartment.
(e) Subject normally arrived at the Institute at 1800
to teach evening Spanish classes.
7. Prior to this reported telephone conversation, I had
considered using Subject as an access agent against GAZIYEY,
but had decided not to approach Subject on the matter unless
there was evidence that his relationship with GAZIYEY was
developing into something more than occasional chats between
classes. I did not see much potential in approaching Subject
before this with these the idea of having him deliberately
cultivate a friendship with GAZIYEY, as I felt Subject was living


206
such a busy and hectic life that I would get very little out
of him. Prior to his marriage, he was keeping such a hectic
schedule between his Institute and private classes that he
wasn't sleeping or eating properly and was having increasing
problems with his health. If anything, his pace and health
problems increased after his marriage and his taking of the
job with the American School (although he gave up most of his
private classes).
8. Since the GAZIYEV-LOOINOV conversation made Subject's
relations with the Soviets look much more interesting, I attempted
to find out what I could about them from Subject. For a number
of reasons, however-including my going to the States in June-
we were not able to get together until 11 July. On that date
I took Subject to a belated "bachelor's lunch" at a little
Spanish restaurant downtown.
9. The lunch was disappointing and, for me, misleading.
I was certain that if given the opportunity, Subject would
voluntarily tell me if his relationship with GAZIYEV had
developed any further. When I casually brought the conversation
around to GAZIYEV, however, Subject simply told me that GAZIYEV
was still studying at the Institute and that he still occasionally
chatted with him in the halls or over a cup of coffee in one
of the near-by coffee shops during the 20-minute break between
the two evening classes. Subject commented that he enjoyed
talking with GAZIYEV, as he was a simpatico, interesting guy,
as well as an outstanding Spanish student. He also added that
they never talked politico. In reply to an offhand question
about whether he had met any other Soviets through GAZIYEV, Subject


207
said that he had not. My inclination was to believe Subject, and
I went away thinking that either GAZIIEV and LOCINOV had been
talking about someone else over the phone or that they had
never gone beyond the stage of simply talking about Subject.
10. On 1 N. Yember 1967, I ran into Subject and his brother
Javier in Sanborns-Insurgentes. They were about to have a
quick lunch and insisted that I join them for a cup of coffee.
As soon as we sat down, Subject told me he had a problem and
would like my advice. He said GAZIIEV had given him an invitation
to the 7 November celebration of the Revolution at the Soviet
Embassy, and although he would like to go for the experience,
he was very concerned that his name would be put on "the black
list" at the U.S. Embassy if he went. He said that he had
tried to call me at the Embassy after he got the invitation to
ask my advice, but had been told I was out of town. (I was in
El Paso from 25-29 October.) He stated that if he had not been
able to reach me in the next day or two, he was going to simply
walk into the Embassy and ask to see someone from the "security
department" about his predicament. What did I think he should
do?
11. I told Subject to relax and forget about going to the
U.S. Embassy, as the Embassy would not give him any advice
other than to tell him that; it was entirely his own business
whether he went to the Soviet reception or not. Besides, I
asked, what made Subject think his name would be put on a
"black list" if he went. Subject replied that he didn't know
how the U.S. Embassy did it; but "everyone knew" the U.S.
Embassy obtained the names of everyone who went in and out of


508
the Soviet Embassy. Moreover, he said, even if the U.S. Embassy
refused to give him any advice, at least it would make a record
of his visit and anyone who was ever interested would his
heart was in the right place. He simply did not want and couldn't
afford to get into any trouble with the U.S. Embassy, he said.
After all, he had an American wife, he might want to go to the
States to study sometime, and they might even want to go to
the States to. live someday. Seeing that Subject was indeed very
serious, I became more serious myself and told him that just so
he wouldn't worry, I'd write a memo to the proper Embassy
department stating for the sake of the record that Subject had
told me he planned to attend a Soviet Embassy reception, but
wished the U.S. Embassy to know he was doing it solely out of
curiosity and was in no way in sympathy with the Soviet Union.
foul
Subject seemed greatly relieved and thanked me very much.
om
12. Seizing of the fact that GAZTIEV had given Subject the
Sut
invitation, I asked if Subject saw much of him anymore. Subject
n-M
replied that yes, he still saw him occasionally, as GAZTIEV was
1 co
now studying English at the Institute. Subject added, on his
fri.
own initiative, that he had also been to GAZTIEV's apartment
t;
twice and had met another Soviet there on one occasion. He said
day
that the first time he went to GAZIEV's was shortly before he
(Subject) got married (Subject ma was married about mid-April
1967) and the second time was shortly after his marriage, as he
and his wife had gone to dinner at the GAZIEVS'. Subject finished
eating about this time, and since he was in a hurry and had
his brother with him, I didn't try to question him any further,
but decided to wait and have a second go at him alone another


209
time.
13. My wife and I entertained Subject and his wife at our
home on 27 November, but the evening was not meant to and did
not afford an opportunity to discuss the Soviets any further.
Subject did tell me, however, that he had not gone to the
7 November Soviet reception afterall, because, despite by
assurances that there was no reason for him not to go, he
felt it was simply safer to stay away from the Soviet Embassy
altogether. At my suggestion, we agreed to get together for
lunch sometime in the near future.
14. For various reasons, including the poor state of
Subject's health when I called him one day in January, we did
not get together for the lunch until 7 March. This time, I
played it straight with Subject, told him that I was interested
in anything he could tell me about GAZIVEV and the otherSoriet
he had met, and questioned him closely regarding the details.
Subject was completely cooperative, and I am satisfied he answered
my questions to the best of his ability. It seemed to me, and
still does, that there was only one possible reason why Subject
had not told me on 11 July what he subsequently told me on
1 November (i.e., that he had been to GAZIVEV's home twice and
on one occasion had met another Soviet there). This was that
he felt somewhat guilty about going to GAZIVEV's and meeting
the other Soviet there, and as long as I didn't push him too
hard (which I didn't on 11 July), he felt more comfortable
ignoring it. The reason he so readily mentioned the two visits

genuinely concerned not to "get into any trouble" with the U.S.

Embassy over attending the Soviet Embassy reception, wished to
impress me with his sincerity about whose side he was on, and
felt obliged to completely clear the record by mentioning the
visits to GAZIYEY's home and meeting the other Soviet there.
15. Subject stated that GAZIYEV had invited him to his
apartment for dinner about a month before he (Subject) went to
Chicago to get married. This means that the dinner took place
about mid-March 1967. Subject said he had expected to find
only GAZIYEV and his wife in the apartment, but that a third
person was there when Subject arrived. Subject said GAZIYEV
introduced the third person as Valentin "something." When I
asked if the last name were LOQINOV, Subject immediately reacted
and said he was almost positive that was it. Subject's description
of the Soviet also fit LOGINOV. GAZIYEV stated that LOGINOV was
with the Embassy (Subject couldn't remember in what capacity) and
described LOGINOV as a good friend. Subject said that the evening
started off very casually, with LOQINOV expressing interest
in the Spanish courses at the Mexican-North American Institute.
LOGINOV, who Subject noted spoke almost as good Spanish as most
of the Spanish teachers at the Institute, said he'd like to get
a certificate in Spanish from the Institute and asked Subject if
he could help him enroll, choose the best course for him to
start with, etc. Subject replied that he'd be happy to, although
it didn't seem to him that LOGINOV needed much instruction in
Spanish. LOGINOV simply laughed this off, and it was agreed
LOGINOV would drop around to the Institute sometime soon.
LOGINOV, who took the lead in the conversation most of the
evening, then began to ask Subject questions which left Subject


with "no doubt" that he (LOGINOV) was trying to fool Subject out
on his political views. Subject said that he couldn't remember
most of LOGINOV's questions, but he did recall that LOGINOV
began the feeling-out procedure by asking Subject if he didn't
find that the Americans were much poorer at learning Spanish
than other nationalities. He also made various derogatory
remarks about the extent of American influence in Mexico. Subject
said that after about ten minutes, LOGINOV's purpose became so
blatantly obvious, that he (Subject) stopped the conversation
and told LOGINOV that before they went any farther, he thought
LOGINOV should know that he was talking to someone who was
"100% capitalist," completely pro-American, and had absolutely
no sympathy with Communism. (While this sounds awfully blunt
and Subject was unquestionably trying to make himself look good
in my eyes, the fact of the matter is that Subject does tend to
be
a bit blunt at times, and knowing his ideological leanings,
fr
I would not put it past him to have said exactly this.) Subject
said that LOGINOV tried to backtrack a bit after this, but the
an
conversation heated up again a few minutes later when Subject
12
commented that he had a pretty good idea of what the Soviets were
fr
up to in Mexico. When LOGINOV asked what Subject meant, Subject
t
related the story he once told me about having been in Veracruz
day
a few years ago when a Soviet ship was actually or virtually put
under arrest there. Subject told LOGINOV that "everyone knew
the ship was loaded with Communist propaganda."
16. After about twenty minutes, according to Subject, politics
were dropped and the conversation turned to more innocuous topics.


812
Subject said that LOGINOV seemed somewhat irritated with him, but
on the whole kept his composure very well and treated Subject
politely for the two hours or less Subject remained. As Subject
was leaving, LOGINOV again said ho'd come by the Institute to
see Subject in the near future, but he never did. One day in
late 1967 Subject saw LOGINOV at the gas station on the corner
of Tacubaya and Juanacatlan, and LOGINOV greeted Subject by
name. However, they did not converse with each other.
17. Subject said that GAZIYEV left most of the politically
related part of the conversation to LOGINOV and never referred
to the evening again. However, a few weeks after Subject
returned to Moxico with his bride, GAZIYEV had Subject and his
wife over to dinner (this would place the second dinner in
about mid-May), This time GAZIYEV and his wife were the only
others present, and the evening passed without any reference
to politics. Subject stated that he still occasionally goes
across the street for a cup of coffee with GAZIYEV between
evening classes at the Institute, but that he has not been
to GAZIYEV's apartment again and has never had GAZIYEV to his
home.
18. Although Subject was very aware that LOGINOV's purpose
in meeting him was to assess his exploitability, he did not seem
to fully appreciate that GAZIYEV had both fingered him for
LOGINOV and set up the situation for LOGINOV to meet him. I
spelled this out for Subject and also informed him that LOGINOV
was an exceptionally capable Soviet intelligence officer. I
also explained that it was very possible GAZIYEV was using the
Institute to spot other candidates for interviews with Soviet


215
intelligence officers, and questioned Subject about GAZIYEV's
activities and contacts at the Institute. Hiowover, Subject said
that as far as he could tell GAZTIEV pretty much stuck to himself
at the Institute and did not have any particular friends there
whom Subject knew about. Subject said he would keep his eyes
open for the type of thing I was looking for, however, and would
let me know if he came onto anything interesting. Subject also
offered to "play up to" GAZTIEV and/or LOGINOV under my guidance
if I wished, but I declined the offer with appropriate expressions
of appreciation.
19. The question that remains unanswered after all this is,
of course, why LOGINOV and GAZTIEV were talking about Subject
over the phone on 24 April 1967. According to Subject, the
dinner which LOGINOV attended took place in March 1967, while
LOGINOV did not attend GAZTIEV's second dinner, which took
place about mid-May. Since I am satisfied Subject told me the
truth, it would appear that the "certain things" which LOGINOV
told GAZTIEV on 24 April he wished to discuss with GAZTIEV
concerned how to handle Subject in the light of the LOGINOV-
Subject encounter in March. Whatever LOGINOV had in mind on
24 April, it would appear that it was finally decided that
GAZTIEV and his wife should simply have Subject and his wife
over to a peaceful dinner in order to at least partially erase
the memory of the first dinner.

to be considerable doubt about their communication. Loguinov night have said
that she had just played tennis, or was about to play tennis, or plays tennis
seasonally. It seems likely that she did not play and was not about to play.
Soe probably chao to the club for the steam bath. She was in a hurry, possibly
to leave back.

boy. She had no partner.
COMMENT
It is possible that Mrs. Loguinov and Mrs. Small are part of a communications
chamel. Loguinov's haste night have been due to the unexpected appearance of
my wife and the risk that Scall night arrive while my wife some was still in the

LOGINOV played tennis at Mundet with S. S. Abdel Rahman Hassan
Abdel-RAHMAN, 1st Secretary and Consul a: UAR Embassy. This was
the first time they had played together. (played doubles with LIREALM
and his wife).
14 May 1967
LIREALM played tennis at Mundet with LOGINOV. LOGINOV's son
Dmitrly was there, speaks absolutely no Spanish or English. Also
not
played with Jacques LEMAIRE. LOGINOV said his wife had had several

heart attacks in Mexico and cannot play tennis. LOGINOV said he wanted
Dmitrly to learn English, like his sister in Moscow, LOGINOV said he
knew Jean BINEAU, when asked if he knew any French diplomats.
LOGINOV claimed to have been in Soviet Navy, then immediately entered
the Foreign Service Institute and straight into foreign service after that.
17 May 1967
LOGINOV plays rennis left-handed. An instructor commented that he
was convinced LOGINOV had played much more than the one year he
admits to, The instructor said he had never seen LOGINOV play with an
instructor.
20 May 1967
LIREALM saw LOGINOV at Mundet-but did not play with him.
25 Jun 1967
LOGINOVA said she was chemist, but did not say whether she had ever
worked in that profession. The LOGINOVs never eat any food at the club,
but LOGINOV drinks beer-there The week before LOGINOV played
in mixed doubles match with 16-year old girl and wow won a small silver
cup. LOGINOV had a Russian movie camera with him and took pictures
of people at the Club. LOGINOV talked to a Mexican named Jose Manuel
LNU, connected with some Mexican ministry that assists SovEmb
personnel; LOGINOVA said Jose Manuel was very sympathetic to them;
LOGINOV said they had meft at the Canadian o r French Embassy.

LOGINOVA seems intelligent, educated, quiet but friendly. Hor Spanish
is not as bad as LOGINOV had indicated.

Jin and Connie Pollack offered their home at Calero 76 in San
Angel for a party for my lawyer. Of the 12 to 14 people at the
party the following are part of a group who have�antid a
Great Books type club. At least once, and possibly twice or
three times they have invited Valentin Leguinov.

Doug Wiltshire, about Masri. Doug claimed that Masri, his
partner is pro-U.S. and anti-Masser. He believes that Masri's
wife is the secretary to the ambassador.
Werner Thurru. The Anglo-Agorican directory lists Wornar

previously lived in San Angelito the Lomas address now shown
in the directory. He since has moved back to Alan in San Angel
and lives one or two doors from Timnie Davis. He is listed
as vice-president of Jeffrey Manufacturing. Ho is reported to
have a great deal of business.
My lawyer, who is one of the more brilliant humorous-type
intellectuals in Mexico has described Wornar as the most
brilliant person he has met in Mexico. Wornar's friends are
agreed, behind his back; that Wornar is "ill-employment", that
he is earning far less than he deserves. His standard of living
strikes his friends and his family. He is a very young, without

Wornar Thurua, about Valentin. As Wornar was introduced to me
he acted very surprised. He explained that he thought I was some-
one else, a friend of his, Valentin Leguinov. He claimed that wo

felt it was highly ovorplayal. My opinion was that this was a

interest in his having set a Russian. I did. Warner then told

were orand the saue group. Wornor spoke of only one occasion
when Valentin was there-he did not say thare wore not other
occasions, Valontin spoke of several occasions. Wornor des-
cribed Valentin as good-astound, narrow intellectually and
curious.
I did not acknowledge mozing Valentin but avoided the issue.
I do not know who knew Valentin and first invited him to the
group. I do not know how often the group meets or where.
Comments
I found Wornor to be very interosting and charming. I have
held the same opinion about his wife for some time. I believe
I could develop him if it wore of interest.
Wornor deserves to be checked. Everyone seems agreed that
there is something amiss hare

go to South Africa and other countries in Africa.
2. During the week of 3 September, PRIKHODKO came to
Subject's office to announce that he was back to the home
leave. Subject asked him about the time of the proposed Soviet
tourist office. The official did that the Mexican Government had
been asked to be specifically SALVAT had told the Soviets that
the tourist exchange between the Soviet Union and Mexico was
so insignificant that it did not justify a reciprocal exchange
of tourist offices (Comment: Eyidentally the Mexicans used
the reciprocity issue to deny the Soviet request.)
3. PRIKHODKO also said that Oleg NECHIPOREKNO (P-74442)
would arrive in Mexico in October and that he would have a
job in the Embassy, not in the consulate.
4. While PRIKHODKO was in Subject's office, Senador
ECHEVARRIA, the brother of the Secretary of Gobernacion came
in and Subject introduced them.
5. Finally, PRIKHODKO mentioned that YATSKOV would
be leaving soon PCS (Comment: As I mentioned earlier, I'll
bet that NECHIPOREKNO replaces YATSKOV).
6. The next day LOGINOV called Subject and asked him
to come to a cafe near Subject's office. LOGINOV started
off by calling Subject a son-of-a-bitch. said, "Look

By this he meant the Embassy's lawyer, not the legal attache.
Subject just laughed at him.
7. On 7 October Miguel ALEMAN Jr. came to Subject and
said that he and Jacobo ZABLUDOWSKY had just seen Ambassador
BAZAROV. They wanted BAZAROV to make arrangements to get
them to the USSR for television coverage of the 50th
Anniversary celebrations. BAZAROV had told them that things
were very tight but it has been a very good way to get the
USSR. BAZAROV would see that they got to the
USSR. (Comment: From LIENVOY we know that the two had an
appointment with BAZAROV on 9 October and thay they had been
agitating for permits for about a week. I feel that by
sending them to Subject, BAZAROV was giving them the brush
of? It the Soviets were really interested in seeing them
go, they would handle it differently.)

1. I met Subject in his room at the Del Paseo from 1415-1530.
Subject will call me a day in advance to set the date of the
next meeting, which as usual will be in the Del Paseo.
2. Subject had not seen or talked with CMYXKHOV or any
other Soviet since he and CMYXKHOV were out together on the evening
of 4 August. At that time, CMYXKHOV suggested that he and Subject
have dinner together the next time Subject was in Mexico City.
Subject agreed and told CMYXKHOV he'd call him the next time
he was in town. Due to Subject's tight schedules on his visits
to Mexico City, however, it wasn't until 28 September that he called
CHMYKHOV. When Subject called the Embassy, however, he was told
CMYXKHOV wasn't in. He therefore asked for LOGINOV, who proved
to be in. LOGINOV immediately recognized Subject's voice and
sounded very pleased to hear from him. He stated that he had
had a wonderful holiday in the USSR (he returned on 27 August),
but was now swamped with work. He added that he had planned to
call Subject as soon as he got things under control. Subject
thereupon said that he was actually calling for CMYXKHOV, because
he didn't think LOGINOV had returned to Mexico yet. LOGINOV replied
that CMYXKHOV wasn't in just then, but they'd both very much like
to visit Subject in Cournavaca. Subject said that he'd like to
have them, but suggested they hold off for a week or so until the
weather got better. LOGINOV agreed and said he'd talk to CMYXKHOV

a continuous smile on his lips. Unquestionably, his type
of charm appeals to elderly ladies and LOCTINOV is quite aware
that he is attractive to the other cox. Without a doubt, ho
tries to capitalize or it and with his fluont Spanish prob-
ably trics to enanare Kexican females. There's no indic-
tion that LOCTINOV has tried anything or the sort with the
Soviet wives. One of the reasons may be that he would not
like his wife, Aleksandra Dmitriyeva, & very formidable woman
indeed, to get wind of it. On the other hand, the Mexican
women may seem to be more exotic and attractive to LOCTINOV
than his own countrywomen, in especial his wife, who is a
large unattractive female.
Nevortheloss, LOCTINOVIE seemed to be quite pleasant, with
a nice cultured voice, and gets along with her husband voll
thanics to her good humour and social activity. She has
been quite corciment in Mestkem vork and in the children's
summer camp. agh Shortly after their arrival, LOCTINOV bought
a tape-rocorder for his wife for 115 dollars. Whether it
was to be used for music, or other purposes, has not been
dotormined.
Once in a while, LOCTINOV goes on drunken sroces. Thus,
on 12 of brutuary 1966, he and two
the Ercbussy gate at three a.m., poundod on the gate, blew
Loir horn and calterative win stanialay

Another very prominent trait of LEOINOVI'S character is
his extreme chauvinism, bordering en jingoism. In roforence
to other nationalitios, LEOINOV uses such deprocatory epi-
hast thets as: "Aterikeahki", "Wenchura", etc.
It is doubtful if LONOVO has any true friends. His
screering attitude is probably the repason for it. Although
he made poveral errors in jugement in his worki ana cocial
behaviour, LCOINOV by no means is a fool and should be loppt
in mind for any possible developments.
E/Adislav Sorgeyevich, vice consul (Attache),
is a young man about thirty-three years of age, rether
stocky, with blond wavy hair over a high forohoad. A pair
of heavy-rinmed glasses gives his the appearance of a very
intellectual person. On the whole, NORMUSMEN has the air
of an easy-going fellow, who can make friends almost over-
night. KORKUSKIN and his wife are exceptionally close
friends with Anatoly Viceninrovich KIRABACH, employeo of
the Commercial Office, and his vire. Soth families visit

whenevor any of the Soviets or his family is ill. KORIUS-
KITIN is also quite active in conular affairs and does most
of the leg work for LOOINOV. No is also very active in
Nestion functions, whore he is in charge of the Children's
section. KORIUSHXIN is quite on
busty individual and can be quite rude and nasty at times.
Undoubtedly, he is looking forward to boing a full-fledged
consul in time to come. The imression of KORIUSKIXIN's am-
bition and pusay trait in his charactor is intenstified by the
sound of his rapid and emergotic but pleasant baritone voice.
A curious jact should be cited here. Shortly after his
arrival, KORIUSHXIN purchased a bage-recoorder for 185 collers
or 70 dollars more than the one bought by his "boss" LOGINOV.
May?
It seems that in the futuro, KORIUSHXIN may slow down
somewhat, but his inner drive and energy vill nevertheloss
make aim a more adroit and skillful individual. His further
progress shculd be watched with interest and caution.

told Subject that his near-tera objective should be simply to establish as
much rapport with CERCHNOV. as possible, with the view to finding out what
kind of pbeion he is and what ho has on his rind. I said he should consider

5. Subject said that he thought a sizable amount of money--such
se $1,200 U.S. per month, would be a vital, although not the primary, factor
in recoruiting CORMRY to remain in place. The prine incentive, in Subject's
view, would obviously be the opiruntunity to help Payt
4. Conterent with the Soviets. CORMRY called Subject at home-about

on Saturday, the 15th, in order to present Subject with three bottles of veda,
but the guard had told them Subject had lect. (Subject said he left the Factory
Sount 1630.) Soid that LORMRY had left CORMERVES because he was
Laving for the USSR on vacation, but he (SOMMORY) was still around and

Spanish.
5. In speaking of LCGINOV, CEMINOV did say that LOGINOV is responsible
for "matters inside Mexico," while he (CILINOV) "supervised Latin American countries
outside Mexico." CILINOV did not elaborate on or give any hint as to what kind
of "matters" he was talking about. As Subject was leaving, CUNINOV urged
his to come to the Clossy the next time he was in Mexico City and they would
have a few drinks. CUNINOV then said that as a matter of fact he was coming
back to Guarnavson the next weckend and would like to see Subject then.
Subject said to give him a call. (NOTE: Subject is unusually busy right now
because of his approaching trip to the U.S.-in about two weeks, but told me
he would try to get together with CUNINOV for a drink. I urged him to do
this.) In all, Subject said he had the impression from CUNINOV's general

MEDIANOON FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telecom with LIROBINI-2 on 12 July 1967 P-11665
1. LIROBINI-2 called the Station at 1345 on 12 July and left a message
for me to call her. I reached her about an hour later. She said she had
met LOGINOV at a party at the Indian Embassy on the evening of 11 July.
During a brief conversation with him, he told her he was going to the Soviet
Union on vacation on 16 July. He also said that PRINHORO was going. to
the USSR on vacation on 26 July. A minute later, he said PRINHORO was
leaving on 29 July.
2. Subject said he had had no other contact with any of the Sovieta
since March. (It will be recalled that she invited PRINHORO to dinner
on 31 March, but he did not come.) Subject said she would call PRINHORO
in a few days, mention that LOINOV had said he was going on vacation, and
in
invite him over before he left. She will let me know what happens.

Valentin invited our tennis group to be his
guests at the final performance of the Ballets Ruso
at the Arene Mexico. The total group was about
15 persons.
Alexandra not present. Val's wife, Alexandra, was
not among the group. Val made no comment about why
she was not there. No one else asked, that I know of.
Czechs. Three Czechs were among the group. The
introductions were badly handled and I wasunable to
learnthe identity of the Czechs. Val and they spoke
Spanish root Russian or Czech.
Dithéaurice. (Spelling not certain for last name).
Odele was invited by Val. She is Canadian, about 35, not
thattractive, but careless in her dress. She struck me
as being slightly masculine. She is a teacher of French
the mornings at the University of the Americas. In
the afternoons she teaches at an Institute for Transla-
torism.
was here waiting for a mutual friend of Odile and val,
alafael. He never arrived. I asked Odile who Rafael was.
She explained that he was a teacher and her drinking
buddy. Every afternoon around 4 -5 she and Rafael can
be found in the bar across the street from the institute.
Odile had been drinking beer, probably quite a bit,
prior to joining us that evening. She has lived in
Mexico for 15 years. Her French, English and Spanish
are fluent. She seemed to prefer French, though I felt
her English was better.
She dressed oddly with white bobby socks. She did not
fit in with the rest of the group. And I'm sure she didn't
care. She seems to go to all Soviet embassy functions.
She might possibly be an intimate friend of Val's, as
if not a mistress, at least an occasional bed-partner.
She commented (within the context of tennis, which was
the topic of conversation at the moment) that one might
Val told her he had to go home early (11 pM) but

STAKES-OUT REPORT
DATE: 8 March 1968
1. I checked the Hotel Prince from 09:45 to 09:50 and
noticed nothing unusual. I was outside the Hotel Alfer from
09:50 to 10:30 - nothing unusual. I then checked the Prince
again at 10:40 for 5 minutes and noticed nothing.
2. I checked the Hotel Prince at 16:50 and saw two women
and two men (Soviets) talking in the lobby. Then at the Hotel
Alfer from 16:55 to 17:40. Nothing except a man at 17:30 who
looked very Buropean. This man looked into the lobby of the
hotel, then into the adjacent garage, then back to the hotel
then out of the area. He definitely was not a local Soviet.
The hotel is a lot to the Hotel Prince to see if the
entertainers wore there. At the time we left who could be
Soviets. I followed them to see if they were in the same
I turned the corner from Luis Moya onto Juarez going cast, I
almost bumped into LOIGINCY who was ceing west on Juarez. I
recognized him immediately. and I felt that he recognized me.
I would like to be the hotel. I would like to be the hotel to see
where LOIGINOV teut. I then steod on the other corner. I were
and Luis moya ior 3 or 4 minutes. At this time I noticed a
Soviet across Juarez (at the west side of the Juares monument).
I would like to be the hotel. We wish to much bair. This Soviet
was taking panoramic shots and a.m. and a.m. was
approached me, I stepped behind a Kiosk. However, in the minutes
before I noticed his, he could have been photographing as. A
Buckett's letter I noticed LOIGINOV about 10 yards from the Soviet.
Both saverters were the most popular. The Soviet oith the camera
then drifted west, photographed with the 10th floor of the
further west. LOIGINOV then vent off in the same direction. I
then went to report the above to CLASTONBURY at the Hotel Alfer
after checking that I was not followed. I got there at 18:02.
4. The Soviet had a small caomn which appeared to be
6 ma. Thus I doubt if he got identified pictures of me.

5. He checked out of the hotel at 18:30. At 18:40 we
saw LOGINOV's car ahead of us on the Reforma headed toward
the Boviet Embassy. Two men were in it whom I did not recognize.
6. LILYRIC has LOGINOV and BARAMOV leaving the Soviet
Embassy in LOGINOV's car at 15:36 on 8 March. Neither were
back by 18:30 when LILYRIC secured. I instantly recognized
BARANOV's photos as the Soviet with the camen.
7. Also per LILYRIC, LOQINOV left the Embassy in his car
at 09:41 and returned on foot at 10:51. This was the period we
were waiting for Subject. However he could not have some as
at the Hotel Prince since I loft there at 09:50 the first time
and at 10:40 the second time.

4. Administrative:
No administrative matters discussed.
5. Information/Instructions Passed to Agent:
Roston advised LINEALM/1 to continue his same line
with his friend Velentin Loquinow. He agreed with
LINEALM/1 that since Loruinov did not bring up the
metter of his "boss" since his first roference to it
at 27/1/68 at the French Club, Loquinov probably has
been the further thought to the matter. (Loquinov
had two out of the time of the mater up again
with LINEALM/1 and did not read.
Rowton also advised LINEALM/1 to continue to push
LINEALM/1 into the PKI but agreed that in the light
of the current unce: tainty as to whom might emerge
as the future leader, LIRALM/C/1 should not attach
hisself too firmly to any one individual, but rather
await the outcope of the 27/2/68 convention.
6. Information/Reports Given to Case Officer by Agent:
LIRALM/1 gave Rowton his reports 050/JF and 051/JF,
attached herewith, tore her with the latest LINEALM/1
report passed to LINEALM/1 through the drop.

A check at the building confirms that Subject lives at
Ignacio Esteva 21 - apt. 2. Near the door bell at the main entrance
in the slot corresponding to apt. 2 Subject name appears : V.S.LOGINOV.
2.
The building is quite new and it's floors. The let (ground) floor
houses the Instituto de coronometrologia, and as on the 2nd 3rd floor
there are 2 apt per floor. The building has no garage.
3.
Apparently there is no portero in the building because there is
no bell for the portero. The "interphone" enables tenants to identify
visitors and open the door electrically.

DATES OF MEETING: 11 and 19 January 1968
1. I met Subject in his room at the Del- Paseo Hotel from
1415-1545 on 11 January and from 1415-1515 on 19 January. The
next meeting will be arranged by telephone.
2. The Soviets. As of 19 January, Subject had not seen or
talked with any of the Soviets since his telephone conversation
with LCGINOV on 28 September. Subject did, however, receive a
Christmas card from LOGINOV. With my agreement, Subject sent
inexpensive gifts along with Christmas cards to LCGINOV and
CERYKOV, but they weren't delivered until the week of 15
January. Subje:t explained that before Christmas, he assigned
his salesman the job of delivering a score of Christmas gifts,
including LOGINOV'S and CHRYKOV'S, around town, but shortly
after Christmas, found that the salesman had not delivered any
of them. This discovery caused Subject to fire the salesman,
who had been increasingly derelict in performing his job over
the pact few months and who, Subject had recently learned, had
begun taking dope. Subject consequently wrote "better-late-than-
never" notes on the cards accompanying the undelivered gifts and
had his new salesman deliver them. I have instructed Subject to
leave the initiative for the next contact up to the Soviets.
3. Soliman CCHARY. Subject ran into GOHARY on the street
one day during the first week of January. GOHARY seemed delighted

Policeman Recruited by LOGINOV
1. In reviewing LOGINOV'S SR which WENING has 'just
completed, I note that LOGINOV recruited this policeman
1
>8 months ago and that his first requirement was on the
BOESTROM couple. At that time we gave LITEMPO-8 traces on
LOGINOV saying that he was a dangerous KGB officer.
LITEMPO-8 subsequently mentioned that the case was continued
and that he, himself, was directing it.
2. If you think that LITEMPO-8 will cooperate, I would
like to know the following about this case:
(a) Is it still active?
(b) Did the policeman pass info to LOGINOV
on the BOESTROM couple? If so, what? Was
there any follow-up?
(c) What type of requirements has LOGINOV
given to the policeman? Are any Americans
involved?
(d) Have any other Soviets been involved with
this case?
(6) Who's handling his while LOGINOV is in the
th
USSR on vacation (he left Mexico on 16 July? and
3. And if it is not a good
that we are especially concerued about LOGINOV because he
specialises in US operations. He tried to recruit a chauffer
at the Embassy and tried to develop a female Foreign Service
Officer (true). You might also say he is running a sensitive
case into the US (false). Thus many of his requests to the
USSR on vacation (we were ready to Operant) and although
this would not necessarily support. Therefore we would

Mexico. She was held and interrogated the author SALADANA's
influence, she was released by the members without charges.
The members were asked to let her work at UNAM and told
her that they would have to approve any job she undertook.
She still has to report to the police every 3 days. Subject

the FALA:
a. The FALA has 76,000 members.

The neet veo pregraranged and S came on time. The purpore of the
meet was to debrief S on his neet with LOS which took place the pre-
vious evening and proceed with the filling of the P&3 as well as to
give necessary opc instruction. The purpose was achieved.
Next meet: August 18 at the same time end place.
2.
The fact that LOR started the neet -ith a talk about booke
appeared to S to he curious. No doubt that LOR was peddling some Comment
ideological tid bitn, especially, justification of SOr International
policy. Friell, too much freedom is not good: Americana and their foreign
policy is naive: they worry more about the world o,inion than about
their attention interest: : they -st to in conthich they conult every-
body and. e-erything to find out an aseo old 'act that neby can satisfy
everybody; Mixons trip to Rernate was outrigi: a provocation aimed at
Sov Union, except, if it was e product of nevvenese.

S the resliy surprised to neor 11. giving up so caily on the
matter of the US Emb quence dim- lory, but he was outright disrepointed
When LOG stated that ho nor any of Sor Lach

po licy concerning Sov - Red Chinese conflict for a Chinese Emb official.
Although, he did not mention it to TULLOD, it was obvieve that S did not
like at all the idea that big coney was spion that there
money right now, 1.e. during the pariod "S will be auring on
CARET confidence".

other to appeone hie (5) ona fear from the care peribility that somathing
might 60 strong and he would have norhere to turn to. F told him that
coing to TANG ONLY in connection with the natter of publishing the orticle
could do him no harm; denying having contact with LON recently is not
sufficient; TANG could bring up the question for an ctenesive purpore
of wanting to send a message to S Sov friend and the fact of not seeing
each other during the act 2 - 3 weeks means nothing nesde-nothing, be-
cause 5 is supposed to be cible to reach a friend; S must to ready to
meet any question by TANG not by denying previous statements but by
emphasizing that he was thinking carefully about that he told TANG and
he reached the conclusion that that would gettixx him in a situation
he was never before"and, consequently, knowa othing about possible con-
sequences; therefore, he decided to keep out a field he is locarest in.

concerned, 2 told 5 to do nothing for the time being and, orpecially,

Subject: Jimmy FABORI (P-15850) Report on Hie
Meet with LOGHOY (P-11,712) on Aug 4 at Bamborns-En Angel
at 2000 hrs.
1.
The meet was prearranged and it lasted 2 hours and 15 minutes.
As in all previous cases S and LOG met in front of the restaurant. LOG
came 3 minutes earlier.
TEER NEXT MEET: On Aug 16 E and Josephine are to come to
Quautla at the "Banco" about 1000 hrs to
be guests of LOG and his family ( to celebrate
5 birthday which is on Aug 15 ).
On Aug 25 at Eamborne-Sen Angel at 2000 hrs a
business meet will be hold.
2.
LOG and 8 2 Vodka cocktails, club sandwich and a beer. LOG
claimed that he had already eaten something and 8 felt a atomicah dis-
confort.
3.
LOG asked S did he finish reading the book (in English) about
Resputin which he gave him about a month ago. E answered affirmatively
and they spoke about the book. LOG promised to give S another book, witten
a a British, titled "USER 1941-45" or similar. LOG wants B to be
familiar with the suffering of Bov people during the WW II.
4.
Then, LOG asked S what was the situation with the US Embassy
Phone Directory. B stated that the fictitious girl Patricia showed up
for few day and returned to the Statea for family rensons. He brought
up in a conv with her the Directory and she told him that it was tightly
controled. S left it at that point and he told LOG that he would have
to atert working on the matter from sarteth if LOG wanted the Directory
but 6 would appreciate LOSE ourgontions as to bow to go about it. LOG
told B to forget 1t because he know that the directory was well controled.
9.
The next question by LOG was the progress did 5 make with
Br. GANG. 8 to: 1 his about his meet with TAGG on Aug 1 (see FENHALDIE
FADCHI Gontaceh Report dated Aug 8, '67), LOG listeed to the story
without interrupting e.i. then he told 8 thes he ene not cortala that

TANG was a member of the Ohinese Emb staff here, because he did not find
his name in the diplomatic list. Further, he told S that he was doing a
good job, which he appreciated, but he must be very cautious because the
Chinese are clever people and extremely suspicious.
6.
In reply to S' question LOG stated that th'hor anyone of them (Sov
Emb official) would meet with TANG, because that it too dangerous. S que-
ried what was dangerous about it and LOG stated that there was always
a chance that they (TANG and LOS or another Sov) might be seen together
and that would be very bad. S went on to tell S that it would be his
job to develop friendly relatione with TANG of possibly another Chinese
official and slowly obtain from him the info LOG and his embassy needed;
LOG will guide him as to how to go about it and if they show confidence
in S he will have it made and Sove ( LOG used the expression: WE ) would
pay him very well for that job. E commented that he had believed that
what he was doing he did out of personal friendehip with LOG and not
for money. LOG emiled at S' statement and added that in addition to meney
they (Soves) ensoble S to travel to Eov Union and have a vacation on the
Black Sea.
7.
While S was thinking whether to say something or keep quiet, LOG
told him that the next time he went to TANG he should limit his conv
to the publishing of the article about Nat Ohina and if needed " deny
that he had any contact with his Gov friend (LOG) since he met TANG; S'
job is to win TANGs confidence and that is a slow process with the
Ohinese. Then, in answer to LOGS question S stated that there were to
Nericans ( a woman and a man ) working et the Chinese Emb. LOG told him
to get their names and addressees. S commented that this was not as simple
as it sounded, because one cannot just ask a person what was his name
and address. LOG commented that even this was a matter which cannot be
runshed; first get their names and later obtain the address:
8.
There was another thing S should do; find out how many Ohinese
live in Mexico Oity and detoreined whichones were the influentiolone and
among the letterones detoraine which are the most influential; he can
etart working on this by dropping in a better Chinese retourent and
trying to develop ece aquiquance; it can be assumed that those who
so to restaurante are people who have money and thoo who have money are


291
- 3 -
useaullu influential. E agreed with LOG and expected LOG to tell him that
he would pay for the vioiting of Chinese restaurants, but LOG kept
quiet.
9.
E had no intention to skip the talk about money and he told him
that the publishing of the article about Kat Ohina may end in a blind alley
if TANG does not supply at least a half a page of advertising. LOG did
not went that to happen and he told S that he (LOC) would give him
KN 1,000.- if the printing of the article should be held because of lack
of advertising. S brought to LOCs attention that half of page of advertising
brings to Pierre (RUDLAN) 1,500.- - pesos. LOG felt that he would pay that
money as a price of keeping the door open to the Chinese Emb for S. To
put some costing on the pill 8 added that he would try to obtain an ad
or two from Chinese restaurants, but he daubtted that the owners would
be interested in advertising in a magazine which is far from being well
known. Just the idea that S contepleted going to Ohinese restaurants
pleased LOG's ear.
10.
LOG was interested in the status of the Presidential race and
S told him that it narrowed down to four candidates and that all the
indications were in the direction that OEEZARRIA was to be the official
FRI candidate. 8 believed that by Aug 20 he would know the name of the
candidate. In reply to LOS' a question S stated that the candidate will
be publically known Sept 15-20.
11.
LOG wanted to give more time to be positive of the name of the
Presidential candidate and he decided that their next (business) meet would
be on Aug 25 at the same rimc and place. LOG immediately added that he
did not forget that S birthday was on Aug 15 and that he believed that
it would be the best if they celebrated together in Ouaulta on Ems Aug 16.
LOG added that on that day his wife and son would be with him in Ouaulta
and 8 should bring along Josephine; Log will bring a bottle of "Ruesien"
champaign and pic-nic style food; there will be bottle of Vodka for
Jisephine and a bottle of ( P does not remember what ) for 8 blue the
book he previously mentioned. LOG added some more description about
what a wonderful day they would have together. They are to meet in
Cuautla about 1000 here at the "blanoes. LOG will be there without fail
because he will pick up his son who is now attending the "Ruesian School"

in Quernavaca; the son speaks only Russian and English and LOG is looking
forward to the fact that his son will be obliged to speak english all
day; LOGs wife speaks a little Spanieh and there will be no problem for
her and Josephine to undertead each other. S promised to be there.
12.
Lest moment assignment for S; LOG hold an info that TANG speaks
Russian. If S succeeds to verify thie fact LOG would like to know where
did TANG learn Russian.

Subject mentioned near the close of the meeting that he owed me
$600 (US) for the TY set which COIGNE had obtained for him. I said
that I thought this was a gift but Subject said no, he insisted on
paying for it and would do so shortly. Meanwhile, a part has burned
out and he can not obtain a replacement in Mexico because this
particular model is not made in Mexico, He will call in with the
details and I will try to get it for him.

Subject had been in Europe and Israel for several weeks since
our last meeting. Nothing of particular interest developed on this
trip.
8. Therefore he left Subject was invited by NECHIPCERNK (P-7442) to
celebrate the latter's birthday (which happens to be 4 (MUST be
tried to beg off but NECHIPCERNK0 refused to take no for an answer
and actually came to Subject's apartment with KOSTIKOV to bring
Subject to NECHIPORENKO's apartment. Since NECHIPORENKO's wife was
away, three girls from the Pianitsky Chorus were awaiting the three
men. Considerable drinking was done and Subject said it was obvious
to the other. The other people who had been asked to have a chance
was Nina BUCHAROVA. Subject said that all of the girls were quite
attractiv and "available for anything, Subject said that he under-
stood that most of the girls in the Chorus fit this category and that
they would simply wait until their housemother was asleep before
going out and getting some action.
Subject and NECHIPORENKO actually have a good personal relationship.

SUBJECT MOVES that NECHIPORENKO is very intelligent. He speaks
the best Spanish of any of the Soviets known to Subject and due to
this facility as well as his looks, can pass for a Mexican. Subject
believes NECHIPORENKO was given the task of cultivating and
attempt to make a new idea of GOING valid. Subject had
some interesting comments about LOG ING. The idea of
give with other comments which have been made about him. LOGINOV
was carefully originally been given the task of re-recruiting
Subject. This was called, he felt rebuffed and has since been very
cool towards Subject. This was a great deal that LOGINOV either has or
thinks he has been given bad marks by his superiors for having
failed with Subject. LOGINOV is probably also ours or NECHIPORENKO who
has at least managed to retain Subject's flexibility. Subject says
that LOONOV is not dumb and that he uses his English. Due to great
advantages, he is fairly with women.
Subject has been given a second dealings with IVANOV (P. 612) who
is furious for the following season: Formerly Sootts leaving Mexico
would take KLM or Sabana to Europe where they would pick up Aeroflot
the following day. KLM and Sabena would pay overnight hotspots.
Now, however, the Soviets are picking up Aeroflot in New York.
The results of a building, however, they still must spend at least one
night in New York, and the only one of my this and IVANOV wanted
Subject to cover it. Subject refused for the only one of the
it did not make sense for him to pay $20 for selling a $127 ticket
to the his profit was only $9. IVANOV became furious and Subject
yielded by the only one to pay for IVANOV's accommodations and he said he
would do it for those who were friendly, such as NECHIPORENKO, but
he would not do it as a general rule. While Subject was away,
however, his wife went overboard and got IVANOV four rooms (for two
people). Now Subject is furious.
On 31 July Subject was visited by PRKHIDOKO (P-2270) who came
in carrying a copy of Pravda or Izvestiya. Subject quoted the old
saw of the first one of them in Pravda and no news in Izvestiy. and
PRIKHIDOKO got mad claims that the United States very unfriendly by
making anti-Soviet propaganda. PRIKHIDOKO was a very good person is
probably as good and as accurate a thumbnail sketch on PRKHIDOKO that
we are:likely to get. PRKHIDOKO, who said that he was leaving in
the United States, he was a friend out what Subject knew about
a congress of Jewish intellectuals and the people held in mid-September
in Bogota to discuss the Jewish problem 4 the Seven World War
wanted to know who was going from Mexico. Subject told PRKHIDOKO that
the United States had the congress but would check into it. He did check
with someone who had been a great deal. It was horiited to learn
that word bed gotten ou since at this time. The idea of Congress
is confidential. Subject told me that he would tell PRKHIDOKO that
it would get him involved with further requirements and would be working
against the best interests of the Jews. I told Subject that I
agrees to be.
Subject said that the Sputnik group which was due in June never
did get Mexican visas and their trip has been cancelled. On the other
band, a delegation of about a dozen Soviets is due in August: for a
Congress of eye, ear, nose, and throat specialists, and still another
group of a dozen is duo in September for a congress of soil mechanics.
Since these are official delegates as opposed to the sputnik group who
were tourists, they will have no trouble getting Mexican visas.
The Committee will be going to Budapest from 1 to 7 November
for the 1970s. The Committee will obtain clairman of this group which
persuently is the International Government Organization.
Subject has received several letters from the United States translator
me one on his recent trip to the Soviet Union, the British received the
dictionary that he had sent her from focus on the art books he had
sent her from Mexico but not a pair of glaarshe had had sent her by KLM.
Subject will look into this. He is obviously quite fond of this
girl and appeared to be seeing my appearance that she can not a
kch provicution. I peciated that I had said before which is that

Subject: Jimmy SABORI (P-13,850)
Date of Meet: August 1 at Restaurant INN Le Olub and Bonaparte Bar
from 2000 to 2540 hre
1.
The meet was prearranged and S came on time. The main purpose
of the meet was to have/fill the PAQ on LOGINOV (P-11,712), which was
accomplished to a satisfactory degree, i.e. 26 pages out of 53. Further,
FERNALD wanted to check wist S has done or prepared for his next meet

2.
On Friday Aug 1 at 1400 hre 3 called on OHINAKSLEN TANG, Minister
Counseler of the Nat Ohinese Emb at his office. The purpose of the
call was to explain that the magazine La Mission goes to press the latest
on the 18th of the month and it was too late to have anything published
on Nat. Ohina. In accordance with the instruction 5 received from Pierre
HUDIAN, 8 told TANG that in publishing such articles the magazine writes
them according to the wishes of the embassy of the country about which
they are written. Because embases pay only the subscription, they
usually see to it that at least a half of page of advertising is in-
cluded in the same issue.
3.
TANG expressed understanding for such a preetice and stated that
he was interested in hev ThigherArticle on the Republic of Ohina and
probably one on Chins-Xa-Shek and that he would see to it that a proper
amount of ade be purchased.
4.
TANG went on to ask which embases are subscribers of the
magazine and which use it for publiching articles. S stated that prectioal-
ly all embassies are subcoribere and almost all of them had their articleo
published at one tiae or the other. TANG, apparently, was not satisfied
with this enower and he asked point Mn blene was the Sov Rmbasey a sub-
coribor.
When R answered affirmatively. TANG aedd 8 did he know anybody

in the Sov Embassy, 8 stated that ne was on friendly terms with an
official of the Sov Embassy. TANG commented that this was unual, because
Sove make frends with nobody. 8 stated again that he had no other way
of calling his relation with the. Sov official than a personal friendship.
In reply to TANG's question S. etated that he prefered not to mention the
nase of his Sov friend and TANG asked what position did 85 Sov friend
have. S replied that as far as he knew the Sov official was quite high up
(sic). TANG continued his questioning: what was the nature of 5 relation-
ship with the Sov, was it a basiness type relationship; how often did they
see each other; where dd they meet. S stated that he never transacted
any business with the Sov and they meet about twice a month for a dinner
or lunch in various retesturante. S added that the Sov plays tennie every
week-end and that he (E) sometime goes to watch him playing (Note: the
latter statement is not true). TANG asked did S play tennis and he an-
swered negatively.
6.
At this point S asked was he interested in meeting his Sov friend
and TANG stated that he was. Then, S asked was TANG whet should he say
to his Sov friend. TANG commented that this was a good question and he
told S that he would think about it. Consequently, he asked 8 could he
pases by on Monday or Tuesday (Aug 4 or 5 ) and 3 said he would.
7.
In reply to Fo question S stated that he intended to tell LOG
exactly what tranpired on his meet with TANG and that he planned
visiting TANG on: Monday so that he would be able to tell LOQ did TANG
decide to meet LOG.
8.
P told S that he was going too far in pleasing LOG and was
getting in a deeper and deeper mess by getting involved with the Nat
Ohinesses, it was obvious from the attitud of Mr. TANG that he read him
through and was taking his time to find could he benfit something out
of the whole scheme. Therefore, S should also take it easy and not
rueh to see TANG on Monday, i.e. before seeing LOG; further, he should
stick to his previous decision that it was rather dangerous to be
meeting with LOG often.
9.
S felt that LOG would press for a most with S as soon as possible
once he got to know that TANG had opened the possibility of wanting to
meet with LOQ. F considered this to be poe:ible and impressed on S that

it was up to him to atall.
10.
At this point S asked P would we help him out if he got in troubles
on account of his association with LOG. F replied that he was trying to
instruct him how to keep out of troubles and it appeared that S did not
care much about what F was telling him. S resected quite strongly to Fx
statement by saying that F was wrong, or at least incorrectly interpreted
S attitude, as far as he (3) is concerned is he is willing to discontinue
meeting with LOG immediately, if we tell him to do so. P answered that
if we wanted him to drop LOG we would had told him to do it. Nevertheless,
S as an American is certainly aware of the fact that the US Service and,
consequently, the US security is getting nothing out of S collaboration
with LOG; in view of the fact that LOG will remain here only about 2 móthe
more we felt it would be the best to leave the matter take its normal
copree and find it nstural end; we were and continue to be interested
in keeping about of trouble, but to achieve this the most important thing
was that he carry out our instruction as he received it; we badly need
that S fullhsertedly comply with our instruction; if S' association
with the KGD (sic) continues after the departure of LOG wo would probably
be willing to continue our relationahir with 8 only if we were able to
count on his sincerely and complete complying with every instruction he
poy receive from us. S stated that it was clear to him that he could
not count on any help from us if he got himself in trouble by acting
on his own F left it at that.
11.
As the working part of the meet ended about 1040 here S atated
that he was broke and did not anticipate to be in a better financial
condition for two additional months. S turned this theme one way and the
other until he came out with the request for about 50.- Dollare. F answered
that he would look into the matter and we left the INN Le Club and
started walking. S, anes obviously fearing that the meet would birk up
and he would go home without any money, and Copcelined that the place
( the INN) was good for writing purpose but the food was lousy (true)
and no drinks were served and that if he was not broke he would had
invited P to a brandy. P reacted by offering a brandy. Once at the bar
S asked P could he give him some money this evening. P felt it would
serve no purpose if he atalled more and he gave S NISSOO.- and obtained
a reenint for the same.

in epite of the feet that he complained of being tired. the wanted to
eat something, but he did not feel kns heving a full meal. He had 4 drinks
( Run and 2009).
3.
L-1 handed me a peronality sketch which he prepared on BROVIT
which is not much by itself, but it could be useful for
arseesment of B.
L-1.
4.
I questioned as much as I wan able without tipping my hand,
about his vicit to the Cov Emb on July 9. I detested no indication
deception ner -ithholding of info or his eide.

commente and gave him necessary instruction, which are covered in the

6.
Ae L-1 mentioned LCCH questioning about LIVAL-1 he inmediately
pointe: out that the hole thing made no reare to him after LCGH repeated
statement at the lart meet that he was not interceded in LIONL-1. I told
L-1 that it made little sense to me, except, if LOS vated so ecertain
was L-1 celling him the truth. Tien I added that I inbed LIONL-1 had
made some statement thick L-1 could relay to 500 to see that could be
his rezotion. L-1 contennted that once in the past he told 107 that

With regard to Victor I. EANCE P. (cr R) there is little to
be said which the not mentioned in the Attachment 4. the calling
card 1ad the followin phone printed: 45-77-12; 45-15-78 and on the
each was riteeen 52-0n-95. I es not inclined to take a: the face value
LOC's statement that he knen nothing about CANCE, especially, in view
of the fact that TATUS ought to be stending the IICER for some time to
be able to equal some Fuesian and prounced well. -1 is willing to
make the trezlation RANOS wants if he finde no difficulty in handling
the terminology.

LCGh reaction on TACOZ' plan to chor the Sov film at the
C? center at "verzailles appears to be interesting.
9.
L-1 was again puzzled with LOG's hinte that L-1 should do romethin
for the Focialist caure genuinely dislikes the idea of getting involved
in the LGE work. I told him that I also did not want him to set involved
in paying for LGE but 1 ad not want him to be cast anide by Sov uicials;
there will be thing L-1 can do to show the good will end what he does
dru amount to nothing as is the care with the horing of the Sov film.
the roet important is that he does nothing without checking with me.
10.
Ac-ording to L-1, LCG never before remealed his political
way of thinking ar mich as he did in his statements concerning the
excessive freedom in the USRT and other Socialist countrier.
11.
In ancerer to my action L-1 rosted thet he brought up the
quenticn. vi not being invited by LCO to his apt, becauce on the previous
meet I asked him whether he was ever in LOG's house. This correct and

Subject: LIBACON-1 (P-4805) - LOGINOV (P-11,712) Meet
at Restaurant Foods del Retiro on July 28 at 1500 hrs
1.
The meet was prearranged and L-1 was in front of the restaurant
4 min before LOG. The meet lasted about 90 minutes.
THEIR NEXT MEET: Priday August 8 at LOGS Apt et Ignacio Esteva
21/2 at 1900 hours.
2.
No cocktails were taken before the meal and with the meal beer
was
drank. LOG lead off with questions concerning L-16 family, health,
work and entertainment.
5.
Among questions concerning L-1'swork there were also questions
concerning LIOVAL-1: was L-1 giving him classes regularly: was LIOVAL-1
asking L-1 questions about the USSR or Sov officiale; did LIOVAL-1 make
any statements which would show "how he breates politically" (21c). L-1
geve routine answer pointing out that LIOVAL-1 does not hesitate to speak
about his family matters and work, but he never seke questions of any
kind; be takes his language classes regularly ; there were no statements
concerning political matters.
4.
L-1 told LOG that July 24 or 25 a young man Victor I RAMOS
called on him in the evening at home and told him that he needed a trans-
lation of about 20 pages of Russian text into to Spanish and that he
was sent by LOG and he asked him who was the person. LOG stated that he
did not know the person and since it was a matter of translation he (LOG)
sent him to L-1 hoping that he may earn some money by making the translation
L-1 asked LOG did he know that RAMOS spoke some Ruséan which he learned
at the LIONK. LOG stated that he was not aware of that fact. L-1 will
make the traslation if he can handle the terminology dealing with economy.
5.
L-1 told LOG that he spoke to 3, MUNOZ about the Sov film and
that MUNOZ was pleased with the offer. Due to the fact that MUNOZ is
presently undergoing a treatment he was not able to make arrangements
for showing of the film. In reply to LOG's question L-1 stated that
MUNOZ wanted to show the film in the Communist Party Contro (sio) at
Tessuskion

ATTAGKMENT # 1
Versailles, LOG excleimed that for Keavens sake he did not anything like
that; he wanted this to be entirely on private and personal basis without
political elements involved; to show the film at Vessilles would be
stupid, it would just enable the imperialiste to blast in the papers
that the Soes were getting involved in internal political matters of
Nexico; in view of the coming Presidential elections this could be blown
up into a secondal. L-1 remarked that he saw no difference in showing the
film in the OPOentro or in the Centro Asturiano as LOG wanted originally.
LOG
explained at length the difference and L-1 promised to have another
talk with NUOZ.
6.
L-1 told that LOG that quite recently he saw in the press some-
thing written to the effect that there are presently in the USER 4 types
of detention ( concentration ) camps and he wondered whether that was
an indication that the freedom in the USER was being trimmed again. LOG
stated that "this was pure imperialist propaganda". He went on to say
that in the USSR the cefes are full of people and that one can hear them
even critizizing the government. He added that in his opinion there is
too much (domeiado mucho) freedom in the USER and other Socialist countries
If Stalin was alive it could not happen that while the people in America
are openly protesting against the war in Vietnam and against imperialism
a Socialist country as Osecho rises its people in favor of American and
West German empiricalism. "Too much freedom in the USER results with still
more freedom in other Socialist countries; this is no longer freedom, it
is a shameful betrieal of Socialism; I hope that it will be realized soon
that Stalin was right", seid LOG.
7.
At this point LOG worked in a hint to L-1 that he should do
something for the Socialist cause. L-1 sounded his old tune saying that
he saw nothing he could do end added that now when LOG opened him the
door to the American Intelligence Service through Victor RAKOS (actually
working for She Economist Intelligence Unit, S.A., Reforma 116 - 801 B)
he would find out would they pay him well and if they would he would
work for them, because scyway the Soes never gave him anything. When LOG
asked, him what the hell he was speaking about, L-1 stated that he was
ten joking and LOG commented that L-1 had never done anything to help
the Sov effort and consequently, they were not able to pay him anything.

never invited him to his house, while at the time he had met ROVKIN
he was invited to BB house aftor they met the second or third time.
LOG told L-l he had no intention of keeping L-l away from his house,
but he wanted him to know that since the time ROVKIN was here certain
things had changed: previously the Sov Embassy was paying the rent ufor
the. spots of their mofficials and now the officiale have to pay the rent
from their salary. Consequently, LOC lives in a small,modest apt and he
does not feel that it is adequate for receiving people. L-l commented
that LOGS statement made hin feel bad because he believed that they were
friends and that formalities were not necessary among them. LOQ counter-
acted with by saying that L-l and his wife were invited to his apt on
Ved July 30, but he did not want L-1 to be surprised to see in what kind
of apt a Sov hipl officiale was living. L-1 thanked for the invitation
and stated that it was impossible to him to come before 2050 hrs on Ved
because he had late classes. LOC felt that 2050 was rather late and they
agreed that we L-l and his wife would come to LOGE for dinner on Friday

that S cet with 100 on evening (July 21), i.e. at the time S was
supposed to neet with ne and he did not beve the cute to tell ne that
the left me maiting and he sent to neet with 100.
4.
I ment to the detring of S on bis neeet nith 120. 100t of the
aspects of that meet ere seif explanatory. Nevertheloss, there are new
inter-sting factor concerning S1 future neete with 100. It may be noted
that S requested lers frequent neet on basis of suggestion I nege to
his during the brief neet of July 11. Another factor is the ratting of
big money.
5.
There are facte which are naive and contradictory as for ae
100 is concerned. 100 will nork out a plan which is to provide reguirity
to their peroneel neets on one hand and on the other he invited S to
come to the Prench Clut. 100 did not appear a serious operator if
he felt thet S was able to lead 1005 in convs about cllitary strength of
Red China.
AND
6.
The previously heralded frtenchip between 100 and
down to a buile. On the other hand 10 atteut to debrief S on the activity
of 1000111 ves just a little better than nothing. (Till prepare a separate
Attachment).
7.
As the attachment 1.1 shows I discuared in detail the question
of S' phone colla to 100 on July 10.
3.
I eleo chored to S 10 pages of the 100 and he felt confident to
be able to enser then and sinilorance in fact, the reetrant Befaello
does not lend itself to the exonering of dining any criting there. There-

Re: Thone call to LCC on July 10
1.
JS etted without estitotion that he phoned to LCC on July 10,
1.00 the day their neet took place.
2.
JS believee that he made his first phone call (1111 the one
recerced by 1120 hrs. le wes told to call in an tour
end he DID CALL more or less an tour later. Then, he was told that
100 vse attil huy and that he should cell in 30 minutes. IS
COLD as
COLD and eiter quite bit of visiting LIG care to the phone.
Consequently, JS made CRES calls the came phone number.
3.
all THREE calls which 3C made were answered by the eame male
voice. There was no indication that the male answering the phone reoognized
JS's voice in any of his tro back calls.
4.
JS recalls that when he nade this second call end etated that
it was "Vladinir calling" the operator undertozed that "calling" was the
cecond naco and he asked JS whoto spall it, which required come explain-
ing.
5.
JS if positive that at no time during hie 3 calle he mentioned
any kind of necond nate.

Subject: Jimmy SABORI (P-13,830) Raport on
Keet with LOGINOV (P-11,712) on July 18 at SEPe-Parie
1.
The neet was prearranged and it laeted about two hours. The prees
viously used procedure was followed: S and LOG met in front of the re-
etaurant and they entered it together. As usually, LOG was sharp in ap-
pearing at on the spot.
THEIR NEXT MEET: On Aug 4 at Samborns Inurgentes-Tesquena at
2000 hrs.
2.
Gourse of the Neet.
LOG asked S why he did not come "to play tennis with him" at
the French Olut on July 12. S explained that he was not feeling well
and that he did not recover completely from the flu which he had all
week. S added that only for the reason of keeping the word given to a
friend (LOG) he came to this meet. Nice worde by LOG who concluded that
he brought S 2 bottles of Votka which can be used as " a medicine" for
coldie and similar discomforts.
3.
As it could be expected after such an opening of the meet LOG
was interested was S able to accomplish something for him. 8 told him that
he had done what he promised and gave LOG the written report which LOG
read. When he finished the reading LOG remarked that S did not sign the
report. When S said that he was willing to do it right thore, LOG said
that it was not necessary and that he was only joking.
4.
LOG spent considerable amount of time in questioning S about
the ressons, consequences which the cancellation of FEMEX contract(s)
with come US oil companies. At certain point the questions lacked clarity
and S asked LOG point blame what was he driving at. LOG stated that S
should realize that the USSR is the second largest producer of oil in
the world (eio) and that he was interested in finding out was it possible
for the USER to step in where the Amerioane kicked out (eio). S told LOG
that it was diffioult to go more wrong than LOG was in hie thinking,
because if Nozioana with did not want Amerieans involved is their oil
business it was positively certain that they wanted no foreigner. rw-

gardless of who they may be, to have anything to do with Mexican oil
industry.
5.
LOG
cemented that the USER was very much interested in establish-
ing strong economic interchange, especially trade, with Mexico and were
not finding the right atmosphere nor proper respume in Mexico. He asked
S what, in his opinion, could or should be done to overcome this situation.
S answered that he beldeved that the sova ought to change their mentality
if they wanted to trade with Mexico, neimly, in the field of trade they
should forget about Socialiem and adept the Capitalistio mentality to
trade with Mexico 50vs would have to establish industrial plants here
and to do it Mexicane must have 51 per cent here in each case, which
means the controlling stock; in reality this does not mean that Mexicans
would invest 51 per cent of the value
6.
LOG went to the other item of the written report and he asked
8 how he went about in contacting Ohin-Meien TANG, counselor of the
Nat Chinese Emb. 5 told him about posing as a reporter for the magazine
Le Kision and going there on reoomondment of Pierre RUDIAN ( See
FERNALD's previous contact report). S added that in the Sept issue of the
magazine there would be an article dealing with Nat China and the
Peiking - Moseow colfict and if needed another artiole on Ching-Kai Shek
would be published. LOG told 5 that he was pleased with the manner in
which 8 handled the task he gave him. LOG did not discues the contents
of this part of 5% report and he questioned 5 about CETANG: he wanted
to know was 5 in a position to keep this acquaintance alive and develop
it in to a sort of friendly informal relationship; he (LOG) knew TANG from
some formal diplomatic gatherings and he liked the person. 5 believed that
he was able to keep alive the established acquaintance and was not able
to guess as to how far he would be able to develop it. LOG suggested
that 5 do not allow too much time to pess until his next visit to TANG.
8
seid that he could call on TANG on Fri July 25 to explain him that
he did not succeed in getting the article in the Aug issue of the magasine
and will public it in Sept issue; at the same time 5 will make it known
that he was interested in getting the material for an article on Chiang-kai
Cheak which should keep the doors open for another visit
8 was in
his element when he was describing this and LOG was not finding enough
word to praise 5 and at the eame time to encourage his to all he can

- 3 -
to bring his relationship with TANG to a point that LOG could meet TANG
in a friendly unofficial manner. LOG concluded that for such a job he
was willing to pay 8 in terms of thousands of Dollars. After the dust
of verbage settled LOG told 8 that he should try to feel out TANG was
he willing to speak about the military ciregth of Red Ohina. LOG ex-
plained to S that presently the Sove were completely in dark as to the
allitary strength and operational organisation of the Red Ohinese array;
they have no way of acquiring the info because even if they had friends
in Red Ohina none of them dared to maintain contact with Sov officiale
nor officials of other Socialist countries which are known to be on the
Sov side; Net Ohina has many spies in Red Ohins and they are well infoed
on all aepocts of developments in Red Ohina; it is poseible that TANG
would be willing to make arrangements with his government for exohange
of info, especially, military info between the USSR and the Lep. of Ohina
and this would be beneficiary to the USSR and the USA. LOG went on to
tell 8 that he should think in terms of using RUDIAN for getting to
meet TANG out of his embassy; be that a party or whatever might be
needed, the expenses will taken care of by LOG, because money is no
problem.
7.
Then, LOG stated that S should arrange something to enable LOG
to meet RUDIAN in a small, family type, circle. S was cought by surprise
and told LOG that he told him that he and RUDIAN were quite often seeing
each other. LOG stated that he knew RUDIAN well and was in may instances
with RUDIAN at receptions and other formal social functions, but he never
had an opportunity to be with RUDIAN in friendly and unformal circunstances.
S commented that the only problem he found in trying to make such an
arrangement was in the fact that RUDIAN often, sometime even twice in a
week, drops in to see 8 at his (Josephine') spt but he never announces
his vieits in advance more than an hour or two before he comes.
8.
LOG asked 8 what happened to the US Em phone directory; did the
girl (friend of S) return. 8 enoved that he did not have the slightest
idea what was going on, "because in his condition (of health) he did even
go to check did the girl return".
9.
LOG was proposing that they meet in the course of the next week
but 8 told his that he felt that they were meeting too often and in view


310
- 4 -
of his status of a touriet it may be aseumbed that the Gobernacion carry
out spot checks on him; if he was to be seen by the Gcbernacion or Security
agents in company of LOG it is pretty certain that they would take him
in-and interrogate him; he thinks that this can be avoided if they do not
see each other so often.
10.
LOG agreed with S' reasoning and added that he himself realised
that they were getting together too often and he also cannot be 100 per
cent sure that he is not tailed come-time. Therefore, he will out a plan
by which they will be able to see each other whenever it is needed and
will limit their regular perconal meets to twice per month. He went on
to tell S that he would pick up an appropriate spot on which S will place
a chalk sign when he needs to se LOG urgently; LOG will pass by the place
every morning and if he see the sign he will erase it which will assure
S that he und :retood his request and they would then meet the same evening
at a place (restaurant) which they would select only for this purpose.
SOG concluded by stating that this was the general iden and that he would
work out the details which he will explain to S on their next meet which
they would hold in two weeks, i.e. August 4.
11.
S commented that the plan looked good and if LOG was sure that
it would work then there was no need for them to meet more than one a
month. LOG stated that 2 meets per month were needed in spite of the
fact that he was positive that his eyesen was dependable.
12.
S told LOG that he did not spend any of the HM 400.- he gave
him for the purpose of establishing contact with an official of the
Net Ohinese Emb and consequently wanted to return the money. LOG told
him to keep it for himself and that he would give him money, as much as
needed, if he had an opportunity to entertain TANG.
13.
There was some unconsequential talk and LOG told S to come
to the French Olub any Saturday and that he would teach him to play
tennie. LOG explained that he was going to the club every Saturday
about 1000 hrs: S will be allowed to enter if he says that LOG was
waiting for him.

fcrees, thick Nat China underestands and conseider that such a war would

material and told him to return the next day to pick up additional
material which he could use for his article. Cherofore, S vent to
the Nat China Emb on July 18 at 100 hrs and got more of their publications

time to get it. RANS also asked did S or La Mision have connections with
Scos here and S stated they did not, but the Sove were subscribers to the
magesine. Reportedly, this vinit listed about 20 minutes.

After reading the paper ( report) which S papered for LOG
F asked S was the Julien
previously to see to his source on the Port of Spain next Conference and
refored to him as Eduardo. S claims that he knew of no Eduardo CARRILLO
FLORES, and if he had stated that it was Eduardo it must have been a slip
of tongue. As for Julian, he is a a Department ( unknown which) Chief
in FAX.
5.
In reply to Pb question S stated that the US companies affected
by the ECEX decision were Continental OII, Gulf Gas (or oil) and Felly
C11 from Cellofornie.

arey: from his office: he was still cot well : remark: true) but he felt
meh better.

retting all he mented and it -e obvious that we had no
getting anyt in from S because he brought us in the picture at the time

was not his intention to cut us short, but to the contrery, he vented
to be of help to us. F calely atated that S was still s ble to.do that
if he timely-reporte aquaintance with any other sov officiel and followa
our instructiona for every further stup he nukee in relationship with
such an officiel. E said that we could count on. him.
7.
S stated after some thinking that he had occuetione in practical-
ly every branch of the lexiong covernament, but definitely had none in
the Seguridad de Ketado. F commented that this rax understandable because
the Security keeps itrelf separated from pliticking which enables, tais
organization to carry out it duties without interference of politizane.
F added that the Security people and excellently trained and vewo
amngingly efficient in their work. It rns evident that it atatements
left S worried. 2 took advantage of the silence and added as an after

I told S that the fact that DEDEHARD would remain here at least

he is equally ready to do or tell AEDIEHARD anything we instruct him

Subject: Jimmy SANJORI (P-13,830) Report on Hie Meet
with AEDIEHARD (P-11,712) on Aug 25 at Samborns-San Angel at 2000 hr
1 the m
1.
The meet was prearranged and it lasted 90 minutes. No changes in
the pattern of meeting and A came on time.
THEIR NEXT MEET: Sept 10 at the same place at 2000 hrs.
S was invited to come on Sat at 1030 hrs to
the French Club with Josephine. S not sure he
will go.
2.
A apologized for not going to Causalis on Aug 16. Lots of nice
words about thinking about S and Hosephine all day that rainy day.
3.
A had a surprise for S: few days ago he received orders to remain
in Mexico at least 5 months more (sic). When S asked was he ant. pleased with
the order, A stated that he was practically packed up and he had made
plane regarding the pleces he wanted to visit and it was pleasure in
unpacking and so much lose he liked the idea of cancelling his plans.
S asked several questions about As wife and A was giving normal answers.
At: no time did A belittle his wide and he stated that she was 40 years old.
4.
S handed to A a written report on what he accomplished with the
Ghinese. A thanked for the same and told S to get the article published
by all the means; do all possible to get the ad from the Luan Reataurant;
keep in touch with WONG or TANG but make sure there is a bona fido reason
to go to see them, example, to tell them that the ad was obtained, show
them the script of the article before it is published and similar; be very
overful because Chinese are highly suspicious people.
5.
Then, A asked S why TANG was not listed in the Dip Liet. S stated
that it was evident from TANG calling card that he just recently arrived
here. A accepted the explention and told S that WONG was listed in the
Dip List es a counselor and that he (A) had confused TANG with WONG and
that it was WONG who spoke Russian.
6.
At this point A handed to S an envelope containing EN 500.-
and he told S he wanted him to have that money for accidental expenses


320
- 2 -
while cell eoting info for A. 3 pretended he was hesitant to receive money
but did not drag the story long ( from fear that A might change his mind ).
7.
After the brief "ceremony" about giving and accepting the meney
A
asked S did be have any news about the US Knbasey Phone Directory. S reminded
A that he told at their last meet that he had no way of getting it. A asked
S did he know anybody working in the WH USIS. When S answered that he did
not think so A told him there was a number of girls working for USIS, they
work on the 3rd floor (of the Knb building) and several of them live in
the Hotel Geneve; they carry out some propaganda; A is not sure "how far"
can one got with them ( in terms of having good time ), but there is no
problems of getting them ( although, the interest is limited to one girl) to
go out for dinner and denoing. This is something S should look into.
S commented to the effect did A have an idea how much it takes to take a
hick like those for an evening of good time; such a bill runs about
MN 700.- A replied that money was no problem; if S lines up something
it is enough if he phone him a day earlier and he will bring him the
money.
8.
At this point A gave S the following instruction: If S ever
needs something from A, as money, or he has something for A he should
call the Emb and state that he wants to speak to Vladimir of the
Consulste and strese that it was Vladimir calling. If A is in his office
he will take the phone and there will be "just moko gusto de saludarle"
from both sides. If A is not there he (S) is to request to give the message
that Vladimir called. The call should be made in the morning if possible.
Regardless, whether S gets to speak to A or not he is to go the same
evening at 2000 hrs to their meet place at Samborne-Fan Angel.
said
9.
S he would see what could be done and asked A was it possible
that he was not able to do anything about the platinum. A apologised
that it skipped his memory to tell S that he spoke to their Commercial
Counselor Viktor IVANOV (full name mentioned by A) about the matter and
that VI wanted first to know through which Swiss bank would the transaction
be carried out; terms of the deal the buyers propose and be advised that
Sova were not interect in any deale which would be lese than 1 million
US Dollars. As soon as S submits the info, S and IVANOV will start work-
ing on the deal; if IVANOV leaves before the deal is closed it will not


321

affect the deal because ITAROV will be able to back it is Meocow. S
commented that it sounded good and that both of them will make a nice
sum of many money. With a smile on his face A told S that he did not
want any money because he had all the money he wanted. A commented that
this was the case which makes it evident that they were in position to
help each other : A facilitates the platinum deal for S and S get hold
of a girl who can bring out the phone directory for couple of hours.
10.
A asked the regular question as to who will be the next
President of Mexico. S told him it will be Luis ECHERVARTA, but this. is
still not positive. A did not ask for the source of info.
11.
S asked A who was the girl in the restaurant he waved to and
she waved back. S stated it was the girl with whom he x quite regularly
played tennis.
12.
S was not able to recall one more thing A asked him to do or
find info about.
13.
The most ended with a talk about birthday. A has his on Deo 25
and his wife earlier. A made it known that his wife would accept with
pleasure a birthday present as a bracelet.

that he usually left his seat about 2300 hours and went out to the lobby
for sone tinc. She did not know there the contents were actually acade.
Once sho end LOGENOY encountered, apparently accidentally, outside the
Cine Mod theater, a Nexican Array Colonel, who was introduced to her by
LOCIIIOV as "Col. Sergio." In this intonce LOCHIOV did not excuse hissif
to have a private cunversation with the Maxiean. "Col. Sergio" was de-
scribed by AEMIDRIFT as about 40, tall, no coustache or glasses, thick,
curly hair, appeared to be of Spanish descent. The vocation with "Col.
Sergio" appeared to be about 25 years old and vas introduced as his wife
(which AEMIDRIFF doubted because, as sha put it, he didn't treat her as
one would a wife, but rather as a mistress). AEMIDRIFF knew nothing core
about thic Nexican and never saw his again.

Concerning Soviet Cestation in the Nexican Folice: AEMINIFF
stated that she overhend GOLUCERY and EXCINI talk about cany contacts which
they hid in the police here. See said chs had also overhend LOLCRAKOV,
BAKULLII, AND CRAYHONV talk about how cany good police contacts the Soviets
have. However, each specific example which AEMINIFF could give concerned
some non-operational rejave which the Soviets could get taken care of, e.g.,
when the Soviets wanted to get scsthing through Adunum; when sace Soviet
was missing and police coporatice was needed; getting edvince notice when
soze demonstration hostile to the Soviets was about to take place, etc.
She was not able to recall any hints that Soviets had operational contacts
in the police; agents reporting ca with the police were doing; assets who
assisted Soviets operationally in some way. However, AEMINIFF thought
the Soviets probably have such assets.
Concerning Soviet certests in West Carca Police: AEMINIFF

which Koxiogns also were present (she recalled specifically parties at the
hones of KOLONAKOV, PARUHIL, LCGHIOV) and in cach instance the Soviet
officer, at sows point during the evening, had a private conversation with
a Koxican quest. (Unfortunately, AEMIDIFF was unable to recall the nones
of any of the Koxicens she set on these occasions, and of course there is
no way of knowing whether such private conversations were operational
mectings.) AEMIDIFF commented that at purely Soviet parties, husbands al
ways vent off together and talked business, and if wives approctched, they
stopped their conversation.

RECORALDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Recruitment of Diana de la VEGA. 3.1 31 Oct 69
P-11,712
Say about anything, what whether it be American or Russian. He is
only intercested in boose and women. I would say this is a pretty
accurate description of TUCHI (who is now gone--replaced by EXFLUTE's
friend PERRILITY).
5.
Subject has also met LOGINOV, for whom she did not have too.
much exaix respect. ;She didn't think him very smart, and he was
constantly saying foolish things against the United States. Shazzuncr
zankish I asked if LOGINOV had ever made a pass at her. She said noi;
but then she never saw him when his wife was not along. (Again,
she has Come up with a pretty accurate thumbnail description.)
6.
Getting back to SARATOV, they he ve remained good friends
(sincethe Olympics, and the friendship extends to SARATOV's wife.
She ject and Natasha are very friendly, and I would like to keep it
this way, for several reasons. I don't think there has been any sex
between Subject and SARATOV (although I could be strong, and I will
ask, and Is think get the truth). Subject is wall aware of the
friction between SARATOV and wife, and has a matter of fact Natasha
has said quite openly that she intends to leave SARATOV in about a
year. They have an 11-year-old to whom she is very attached,
and since he must return to the USSH to complis the shoplight, she
is going to return with him. In effect, she has chosen her son
over her husband. Subject doosx not know in that Natasha's orderly
close attachment to her son (she von't go out in the evening until
he is in bed,etc.) is the for usit of SARATOV's buying around, of
vice-versa, but it is a fact, and it irritates the hell out of
SARATOV. On the other hand, Natasha is attractive, intelligent,
and if anything more firstly attached to the Soviet Union than
SARATOV nisati. Recently she offered to glis Suet Nizsian

October 7, 1969
Contect Report
Subject: Jimmy SABORI (P-13,830)
Date/Price of Meet: 2000x Oct 7 at Ches Rene Best et 1414 hrs.
1.
The meet was arranged by phone and 8 came about 14 min late.
NEXT MEET: Oct 10 (Friday) Inergentes Sua & Extramedure
at 1100 hrs.
2.
According to S his last meet with AEDIEHARD was on Aug 25. A had
arranged a meet with S for Sept 10, but A did not come to that meet. Two
days later, i.e. after he did not come to the scheduled meet A phoned to
8' apt in the afternoon when he was not home and after exchange of nice
words with Josephine he told her that he was not able to keep his ep-
pointment with 8 two days ago and he wanted to apologize for not showing
up and that he would ring up S in a day or two. Because there were no calls
from A for few days (sic), S decided to give him a ring and advise him
that he had something for him, namely, S had in his possession a duplicated
copy of an "Agreement" concerning the Flatinum deal. As it is evident
from the mentioned copy of the Agreement the same was signed and the
Buyer's Agent signature, was legalised by the U.S. Consul in Mexico City
on Sept 25.
3.
Although, this story lacks auroacy in terms of dates, it is
substantially different from the one G gave to FERNALD on Sept 12, the
date of their last personal meet. Inspite of the vagueness concerning
the dates and absence of details, this story appears to be much closer
to truth, than the version of Sept 12.
4.
S gave me for copying a technical copy of the above mentioned
Agreement concerning the Flatinum transaction. As is evident from the
wording of the Agreement 8 would have nothing to do with Buyer or Buyer's
Agent. The Agreement pleces 8 on the Seller's side or at the best makes
his middle man between the actual Seller and Buyer's Agent. did not
read the Agreement in the restaurant (during the most) and made no com-
ments with regard to the Flatinum transaction as such.

5.
S asked? should he ring up A from the restaurant to ask for a
meet with him. P told 8 that A had left or was about to take off the same
afternoon. Instead of commenting on the fact tha A left without even
indicating to S that he might leave, S stated that this situation was
giving him an opportunity to find out for us who was As replacement.
P told him that it was a common knowledge as to who was As replacement
and that the only thing to ascertain positively was whether A had dropped
him (8) or the developments prevented A from meeting with S.
6.
Therefore, F suggested to S to phone to the Sov Emb by ueing
the dupie. talk (code) which A gave him and see what happens. If abother
person tells him that A left Mexico, S should sek how was he to go
soubt a transeation he initiated with A. If the answering person insists
in knowing what was it about, which is doubtful, B should limbt himself
to the statement that it is a commercial matter involving large amount
of money, and it reached the stage that an action should be taken.
7.
S promised to phone to the Sov Emb on Oct 8 about 1000 hrs and
F told him that he would give him a ring about 1500 hrs.
89
P told S that he intended to discuss a serious matter with him
but did not have all the facts on hand as yet.? added that he would have
all the facts the latest Thursday Oct 9 and be asked S to come on Friday
Oct 10 to the place mentioned in para 1 above at 1100 hrs and that they

Cetoter 4, 1565.
Contract "oyort
Lobres
Subject: LICVAL-1 (P-E303)
Date/Place of Neot: Oct 3 at Rest. Hoc to 1330 lrs.
1.
Prearranged zreet to which L-1 case 10 min. only.
Next meet: October 16 et the same place at 1430 hrs.
2.
Since our last meet (Sept 19) L-1 had not neen LIRACCON-1 who in
two instances apologized ( 2-3 days after the class was due ) for Lot
holding the caix clans "because he was not feeling well". In bath. cases
it was obvious to L-1 that he was dead drunk whon he 34 phoned. In view
of the fact that LIRACCON-1 did not phone to L-1 for a whole week, L-1
gavo him a ring on Cot 2 and he promised to give a lesson to L-1 at 1630 hrs
of Cot 3.
3.
L-1 explained me that his working echodule in the new scholar
year keepe him busy in the morning and the afternoon, except, Friday
afternoons, which makes it difficult on him to be txxix tieing himself
twice a week for LIRACCON-11 class which most of the time does not take
place. L-1 felt that nothing would be lost if he reduced the Russian
d
language classes to one per week, which would be more than he ever actually
had in the past. I told him to go ahead and suit himself.
4.
I told L-1 that AEDIRACON was scheduled to leave in cobut a week
and it would be interesting to ascertein whether LIRACCON-1 knew it. I-1
will show to LIRACCON-1 the Excelcri of Sept 25 in which the Sov Kit
farewell party was announced. L-1 felt bed cobut tho fact that he did
not even have e-chance to see AEDIEHARD face to face.
5.
L-1 asiced could he remiard LIRACCON-1 that he promised to make
some arrangements which would enable L-1 to meet Alls (GLENEOVA 12-13,482)
and suggest that AEDIRACON departure was opening the possibility to do
something along that line. I told L-1 that there was no resson to expect
that LIRACCON-1 would accomplish anything, but L-1 should be after his on
the basis of his former promise.

6.
I told I-1 that he chould tell LIRACCH-1 that a person he knew
quitu x121 xoll 3-4 years ago returned to the US Embassy and that this
Aerriona Embassy official was a very clone friend of a dear friend of
his (L-1). I explained to L-1 that such news would certainly plense
IRNACON-1 for several obvious reasons, but it was more important to se-
certain théther LISACON-1 would relay such news to some of his Sov
equunitances. If it happens that AEDIMERADO replacement or another Sov
official attempt to contact L-1 through LIFACCH-1, it would be an indication
that LIEACON-1 got the news of L-1's US Embassy contact. L-1 liked the
idea and will give the story to LIEACON-1.
7.
At this point it may be recalled that L-1 had met NECHIFORNEKO
(2-7442 ) at the time he had met YATSEOV.
8.
Component by BHP:
In view of the fact that NECHIFORNEKO by himself is
a dotermined KEG case officer who is agressive in
purning American targets, I felt that we stand to lose
nothing by adding to L-1 a lebel of having a contact in
the US Embassy.

SECRET
D R A F T
MEMORANDUM FOR: The Record
FROM
: C/CUB
SUBJECT
:
Visit to the Soviet Embassy, Night of
1 October 1969; Occasion: Despedida for
Valentin LOGINOV
1. As members of the Cuerpo Consular, Terence D. SISTONE
and his wife were formally invited to Valentin LOGINOV's
despedida. The scheduled hours on the invitation were from
7:00 to 9:00. Actually, they arrived at about 7:45 and loft
at about 9:15. SISTONE had two main purposes in attending the
reception: 1) to determine LOGINOV's replacement, and 2) to
meet the Cubans present, if any. On the first count SISTONE
was successful. Oleg Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO was formally
introduced to the crowd as LOGINOV's replacement by Mr. KAZANTSEV,
the Soviet Chargé. On the second count SISTONE was not
successful. The only Cuban present that he recognized from
mug photos was Rafael MIRABAL Fernandez, who quite obviously
avoided any contact with SISTONE, rather furtively staying on
the other side of the room at all times. In all, SISTONE
talked to some nine Soviet Embassy officials that he could
recognize from the mug book and had somewhat extensive con-
versation with three, LOGINOV; KAZANTSEV, the Chargé; and
Eduard Anatolyevich SARATOV, TASS representative. For cover

purposes SISTONE, of course, also had to spend much of his
time with fellow members of the Cuerpo Consular, mostly with
Leander YOURVOLLIAS, the Cuerpo Consular president and ex-
Gréek Consul General, and Sra. Narta FONSECA Guardia de
JIMENEZ, the Consul from Costa Rica and Cuerpo Consular
secretary. SISTONE also met a Mexican engineer, Alfonso
SIBAJA C., who is married to a Greek woman who is Press and
Cultural Attache for Greece. SIBAJA is therefore active in,
though not a member of, the Cuerpo Consular. It is very
very
early to tell, of course, but a man like this could conceivably
become an access agent to either Soviet or Cuban officials.
2. At the entranceway SISTONE met and recognized
Col. Konstantin Nikandrovich BOGATYREY, the Soviet Military
Attache. Both on this occasion and later in the evening
BOGATYREY seemed to have a forced grin on his face. He
exchanged pleasantries but provided nothing of significance.
3. In the reception area inside, SISTONE greeted Valentin
LOGINOV and his wife, who readily recalled SISTONE and wife
from the excursion to the Ford factory in July. LOGINOV also
recalled that SISTONE was Raymond A. FRADYER's replacement
and asked after the latter: Had he yet arrived in Paris?
SISTONE said that he understood that FRADYER probably had
arrived by now. SISTONE asked LOGINOV when he was leaving
for the Soviet Union. LOGINOV answered that he was leaving

on 7 October and that en route he was visiting New York City,
a place that he was anxious to visit. He added that he would
not be visiting Paris to see his friend FRADYER. LOGINOV all
evening was a very amiable host, circulating and talking to
practically everyone present. About half the time he was
surrounded by a circle of very young and apparently unattached
Mexican ladies - perhaps university students. Mrs. LOGINOV
was quite transformed from the very drab woman of the Ford
excursion. She was quite dressed up, even attractive, and
did her best to be a charming hostess, although this was
obviously a forced chore for her. (Later in the evening she
busied herself pointing out what she thought to be the choicest
items on the buffet table.) Valentin LOGINOV invited SISTONE
and his wife to visit him in Russia. SISTONE answered to the
LIVING
effect that this would be wonderful someday if he or the
Russian Government would pick up the tab. LOGINOV replied
that that was not necessary because all Americans are so rich
they can afford a trip anywhere. Later, talking to SARATOV
(see paragraph 9 below), SISTONE was told that LOGINOV would
be spending three days in New York City. Later in the evening
LOGINOV had his picture taken, probably by a press photographer,
with SISTONE's wife, and he was in general quite gallant with
her. In the little speech following the buffet, LOGINOV thanked
YOURVOULIAS for his few words of farewell and the Cuerpo

S E C R E T

Consular gift of a silver plate. He ended his speech by
saying, "Thanks on my wife's behalf and mine. You all have
been very attentive to my great country." About the only
times that LOGINOV seemed reflective and serious during the
evening wore during this little speech and later in saying
good-by to SISTONE (accompanying this with an abrazo).
LOGINOV's last words to SISTONE were said with much real or
imagined feeling: "You Americans and we Russians have to be
real friends in these days of the world."
4. Negatively, SISTONE did not see LIREALM-1; SAO's
friend, Yuriy VANOVSKY; or Chief, SS's friend, Boris CHANYKHOV,
at the Soviet reception. Since there were over 100 people
milling about, SISTONE, of course, could have missed those
people.
5. Prior to the buffot, SISTONE met again Leon (Spanish
version of Lev) N. GOLOUZOV, a member of the Soviet Commercial
Staff. SISTONE had met GOLOUZOV on the Ford excursion as
well, and the two chatted briefly about that trip. GOLOUZOV
carr
gave SISTONE his calling card, which is attached.
6. Standing beside GOLOUZOV, and obviously a very junior
officer under the latter's wing, was Vladimir PETROV, also of
the Soviet Commercial Office. Following the example of
f
brother, PETROV also gave SISTONE his calling card, which is
attached. PETROV looked to be no more than in his late 20's.

He is almost baby faced, has sort of a pug nose, is perhaps
5' 9" tall, is of medium to slim build, and has light hair.
PETROV said he had only been in Mexico two weeks and was
terribly confused by the vehicular traffic, which is much
noisier and extensive than that of Moscow. Although he
speaks Spanish quite well, he said that this is his first tour
in Latin America.
7. Also early in the evening SISTONE net Vladislav
Sergeyevich KORMUSHKIN, Soviet Vice Consul. He is a fairly
tall, heavy built, athletic-looking young man with a very
strong handgrip on being introduced. KORMUSHKIN was almost
the only Russian with whom SISTONE talked who did not even try
to be friendly. He just stood around most of the evening,
listening and looking very ill at ease.
8. SISTONE only met Oleg Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO,
LOGINOV's replacement, very briefly and on an occasion when
LOGINOV was not around. Therefore, SISTONE was not formally
introduced by title or as FRADYER's replacement to NECHIPORENKO.
This man looks very Latin and could mix in a crowd on the
street without any difficulty. He stayed very much in the
jone bet
background all evening. During the little ceremony in which
the
has was introduced by the Chargé as LOGINOV's replacement, he
was asked when he had previously served in Mexico by the latter.
He replied he had been in Mexico from 1960 (or 1961) to 1965.
S E C R E T


348
S E C R E T

The Chargé described him as a young man advancing rapidly in
the Soviet Foreign Service. He also said he had been a
Military Attache before but is now a Second Secretary and
is taking over as Consul. The Chargé described NECHIPORENKO
as a non-Great Russian. SISTONE missed his nationality, if it
was mentioned. The Chargé hastoned to add that NICHIPORENKO's
wife, however, is Great Russian.
9. Possibly the longest conversation SISTONE had with
any Russian was that with Eduard Anatolyevich SARATOV, the TASS
representative. SISTONE was introduced to him by Findley
HOWARD, local Pan American representative: SARATOV was the
only one with whom SISTONE spoke in English. All other con-
versation with Russians and other non-Americans was in Spanish.
SARATOV is a very smooth, gallant man-about-town. He seemed
to really enjoy talking to Americans and other non-Russians at
the reception, and bowed and established rapport with the ladies
of all ages. He said he has been in Mexico two years, is
married, and has one son in the fourth grade, who is naturally
attending the Embassy school and who will be sent next year
to the Soviet Union for his further education. He asked
SISTONE how many children he has and commented on the answer,
five, by saying that in his business it is not practical to
have many children. SISTONE asked him how he gets his news to
send home. SARATOV replied that he is obliged to send home
S E C R E T

daily a resume of the most important Mexican events, much of
which he obtains from the Mexican press. He added, with a
smile, that he, of course, has to supplement such newspaper
accounts with information from his own contacts. SISTONE
asked if this meant, among other things, getting handouts from
Government offices. SARATOV dismissed such sources as
unimportant. He said this daily resume which he sends home
by Telex takes him about two or three hours. He said he is
the lone TASS representative here. He has his own office
separate from the Embassy and prefers it that way. SARATOV
claimed to have traveled around Mexico quite a bit. He seemed
to be impressed with the Yucatan and wanted to know if SISTONE
has visited there. The latter replied that he has not yet
visited the Yucatan since being stationed here, but that, as
a tourist, he had seen the ruins there some years ago. SARATOV
said that he is from Siberia, and in answer to a SISTONE
question said he thinks the Georgians are the warmest and
friendliest people of the Soviet Union. SARATOV obviously
likes to brag about having been stationed previously in
Washington. He also said he would very much like to have been
assigned to the new TASS office being opened in San Francisco.
According to SARATOV, per an agreement between the United States
and the U.S.S.R. the former will have a Consulate in Leningrad
and the latter a Consulate in San Francisco, The opening of
S E C R E T


350
S E C R E T

the TASS office in San Francisco is somehow connected with
the establishment of the Consulate. In speaking of LOGINOV's
three days in New York, SARATOV said he would recommend
three things for him to visit: a good steak house, a good
Chinese restaurant, and Rockefeller Center Music Hall.
10. Somewhat after the despedida ceremony; SISTONE noted
the Chargé, Boris Aleksandrovich KAZANTSEY, alone and intro-
duced himself. From a distance KAZANTSEY looks extremely
young for his high position; closer up he looks a little older.
KAZANTSEV was extremely affable when he learned that SISTONE
was a new member of the Cuerpo Consular. He said he is a
member of an equivalent organization among the diplomats and
in that context knows Mr. Wallace STUART quite well. He said
he was extremely privileged a couple of nights previously to
be able to shake Astronaut ARMSTRONG's hand and talk to him.
He thinks the space program a wonderful adventure for both our
countries, and he mentioned the current negotiations between
the American Atomic Energy. Commission and its Russian equivalent
in working out the rules for use of peaceful nuclear energy.
While affable, KAZANTSEV does not impart any feeling of
sincerity whatsoever. He seems transparently cynical, and
reminds one of a second-rate American politician. After the
above conversation and when SISTONE was talking to a Mexican
airport official, for some reason KAZANTSEV reapproached
S E C R E T


351
S E C R E T
-9-
SISTONE and said to him and the Mexican that he hoped there
would be a rapprochement soon between the United States and
Cuba. SISTONE cannot figure out why KAZANTSEV made that
remark at that particular time unless 1) he thought the Mexican
airport official was a Cuban, or 2) he had been briefed by
LOGINOV not only on the fact that SISTONE is FRADYER's replace-
ment, but that FRADYER had somehow been connected with Cuban
operations.
11. SISTONE only met Yuriy CHERNYSII, Soviet Vice Consul,
very briefly to shake hands near the end of the evening. He
was easily recognizable from his very light gray hair.
12. SISTONE was only sure of one Cuban's being present,
Rafael MIRABAL. At one time; SISTONE thought he saw a gentle-
man who looked a little like Ambassador Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas,
but at second glance he did not think so. There was no doubt
in SISTONE's mind that MIRABAL was avoiding him. On one
occasion MIRABAL was quite close, within earshot, and may well
have heard SISTONE either talking English to a fellow American
or his wife, or discussing something American. Thereafter,
every time SISTONE tried to work his way toward MIRABAL, the
latter would shortly move further away. Twice SISTONE talked
to people that vaguely looked like they might be Cubans from
the mug book, only to discover in both cases that they were
Mexican.

13. One of the above Mexicans turned out to be Alfonso
SIBAJA C., who described himself as a mechanical engineer
and industrial consultant. His address is Ezequiel 82,
Mexico 14, D.F., and his telephone number is 17-88-85. This
man is the husband of a lady he described as Press and Cultural
Attache of the Greek Embassy. SISTONE was also introduced
to her somewhat later and got the impression that she is not
Greek but either all Mexican or perhaps of partial Greek
agreement is Hefness i. disinie
ancestry, SIBAJA and SISTONE exchanged calling cards (SIBAJA's
is attached) SIBAJA said that he and his wife attend such
functions as this reception quite frequently and definitely
recalled not having met SISTONE before. The latter explained
his recent arrival. SIBAJA claimed that he is a good singer
of folklore songs and that his wife knows how to dance them.
They have performed spontaneously quite often at diplomatic
and consular affairs. Asked whether he would be going on the
Cuerpo Consular excursions scheduled for late October, SIBAJA
said he would like to go. He is a working man, however, and
was not sure he could get away. SIBAJA and wife and SISTONE
and wife established rapport rather easily, and all agreed
they should meet agatn rather shortly. SIBAJA said that he
is of partial French ancestry. He looks as though he might
be Mideastern, however. He is proud that he is from JUAREZ'
home state of Oaxaca. It would seem to SISTONE that this is
S E C R E T


353
S E C R E T
-11-
the kind of man who might be used as a fairly nonsuspicious
access agent to either the Soviets or the Cubans. He obviously
circulates in their social milieu. SISTONE intends to follow
up on this man. He said he lives in Colonia Lindavista, where
SISTONE's wife's relatives are concentrated. He has a son
going to Colegio Tepeyac in that area.
14. The only Americans SISTONE was aware of at the
reception were 1) Clyde SNIDER, Chief of the Visa Section of
the Consulate, 2) Findley HOWARD, of Pan American, and 3) David
WIESLEY, American businessman and Honorary Consul of Iceland.
15. Cousidering-the fact that SISTONE was only in the
Soviet Embassy a little over one hour and had to spend a good
part of his time talking to SNIDER, YOURVOLLIAS, and that real
pain-in-the-neck, Sra. JIMENEZ, he considers his contact with
Soviets about the maximum that could be achieved under the
circumstances.

Below is translation of document written by LIBAGN 1 re his friend
who lives in 3-n Juhh del 110.
A Spaniard born in tho province of ASNUA. During the Spanish Civil
War was taken to the USR with other ciliren. Completed his elementary
secidling in Spanish: childrens' schools. bntered Leningrad University n.Joring
in history, and following: grandeur of the school. The school is
a major school in the public, a tablev, in 1957- with the aid of its sixistry,
who lives in San Juan del Rio. Is a manager of a restiunant. Henares is a
very intelligent, sensitive, fellow. Always studied with ploas ro. is very
font of nature and animals. Durin; vorioids of vacation from the elementary
school, and the most important of the school. The school is a large, large
as a shop-herd, water boy, in vineyards, took long walls, read, scan, ani
always tried o be a loner. Therefore, is was not very well liked, was teased,
and once, knowing that he was not a goal suin ur, was thrown from a steep
bank into the river LIGU. He was a very good and most popular in the her,
and was a very good for her. However he visits rexico he
never fails to call on her. Being acquainted with his character an sentiments,
I would say tont not, living in a load city, he suffers greatly. I suppose
that because of his loneliness ho irregnated a squid, oll fashioned, inian
girl. He posiltal views are the most litrral, an lacing an intelligent
fellow, he was never plesed in an unconfortable peetion, all out he was

DECEARO was disappointed when I said I would not attend, but
that this we's no reflection on my friendship for his. I stated
that I felt it urriso for an American to visit the Soviet en-
bassy. I was afraid that the FBI or C/L would learn of my visit.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief SB
INFO
: Chief, CUBA
SUBJECT
: Relationship Between AEDIERARD and Gloria PINTO
1.
In response to a conversation between Chief, SB, and the under-
signed, LIREALM-1 was questioned indetail on 25 September concerning
the relationship which exists between AEDIERARD and Gloria PINTO with a
view toward possible embarrassment of AEDIERARD before his superiors.
2. LIREALM-1 AND his wife both believe (but have no proof) that
it is probable that Gloria PINTO is having or has had an affair with
AEDIERARD. Both LIREALM and his wife are close friends of the PINTO's
and know that Gloria is strongly attracted to AEDIERARD who is both
physically and intellectually superior to her husband. Due to Gloria's
LIREALM fieldship with AEDIERARD at the Branch Club and other places,
LIREALM feels more that Gloria's husband, Pepe, does not yet know of
the affair.
3. LIREALM-1 characterized Pepe PINTO as; aweet, slow-vitted and
below average in intelligence. He is a physician specializing in lung dia-
orders, born in the Canary Islands. He considers himself a Spaniard with
the most important role in the use of respect for women. He attempts to
tightly control Gloria's activities. He is a very good and more than a
as many affairs himself as he can. Gloria greatly resents Pepe's attitude
coward her. Pepe is basically defensive and would. not want anyone to know
if Gloria were having an affair with another man. He would probably deny
it if anyone said so, even if he were aware of it. He would take it out on
Gloria, however, and would probably best her and restrict her movements even
more closely.
4.
In view of the above, it would certainly appear that there would be
nothing to gain, and perhaps much to lose, by any attempt at exposing her
supposed affair with AEDIERARD. Since the now appears to be in contact with
SURGEON, much better to hope for better developments in this case.

is more to this invitation than meets the oye and that the KGB will
be going all out to recruit him. I think Subject may be right and
I think ho should probably find a good excuse for not going.
Subject states that ho had complained to KAZANTSEV (P-880) about
the shoddy treatment ho had been getting from LOGNIOV (P-11,712).
Never before had ho been forced to "stand in line" for Soviet visas
for his clients. In the past, ho had boen able to sent passports
to the Soviet Embassy any day--never mind the office hours-and get
the same time. The other party was a "good source" of a
LOGINOV himself finally admitted that this was bocause Subject had
been uncooperative (meaning that ho had refused to let LOGINOV
recruit him). Subject says unequivocally that LOGINOV is loaing
PCS by tho end of October and that he is not being replaced by a
newcoort. In the case of standards tha NICHOPORINO, who in a former tour
had work in the United Kingdom, then will take over as Chief of the
Consent Section when LOGINOV.
Subject days that KAZANTSEV is about to leave (in fact, Subject
thought KAZANTSEV had already loft) and that both a replacement for
him and a now ambassador were on the way, I told Subject that as
far as I know, KAZANTSEV was to be replaced by another concierge Comgico
who would be Charge, but Subject insisted that an ambassador had
been named and would be coming soon. Ho did not know who the
ambassador would be.
Subject remarked that both IVANOV and NINTROOY had loft and he
said that NINTROOY was, he thought a very decent person.
Subject said that PRIXNIOWO (P-880) who has been in to say
the PYNHOKOE had sought with tears in his eyes, that
Subject had left the head, friend and that he would never forget
him. Ho invited Subject and wife to come visit him in Moscow.
Then when Subject asked PRIXNIOWO for his address, PRIXNIOKO homod
and haved and said that ho didn't really have an address yet but
the
opinion of the United Kingdom. The subject was not a subject of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Subject remarked that PRIXNIOKO
was undoubtedly being sincere, but when you cano right down to it,
he was just as hemed in and afraid as anything of the others.
Subject said that it was a real tragedy that the Soviet ayuten
made such robota out of good people.

Memorandum
TO:
RIZZUTO through ARCHBOULD
From:
FERNALD
Subject: ABDIWARD (F-11,712) 4 Thoughts Re poeibility of Pitching His
1.
Assuming it was agreed that A should be pittched before his POS
departure, because there are no indications that he would be more succept-
ible 1xter to an approach later when he comes to a new post abroad in few
yeare and, to the contrary, it is more likely that he would be still more
daring, more selfconfident and more determined to advance and solidify
his position within the KGB, I wish to add some views of mine to the list
of possibilities as to how a pitch could be carried out.
2.
My views and thoughts on this subject will be based on the possible
use of existing assets and means. I am fully aware that there will be
plenty of room for improvements, additions and modifications of what will
be said in the following peras.
3.
As far as I know we are lacking adequately solid facts in which
we could put our teeth, i.e. we do not made and posese worthwhile mention-
ing material which we could use to exert a desired pressure on A.
4.
I am inclined to believe that we are in a position to make a
serious attempt to obtain a "pressure argument" through the use of existing
assote which are targeted against A and that it can be done without taking
an undue riek.
5.
As a move in this direction I was thinking in terms of having
recorded a SABORI-A meet for which we would prepare SABORI. To be more
apecific I have in mind a situation along the following lines:
this a. In going to one of his next meeta with A, SABORI should
nary on his person a transmitter. I am not in favor
of a body recorder, because the recording time is
limited and it requiren the bearer to be turning it
en and off, while the transmitter can be set and it
require no action by the bearer on one hand and on
the other the bearer is under the impression that


370
2 -
every action and statement of his is recorded from
the moment the transmitter is strapped on him.
b. SABCRI should go to such a meet with expereasion of
a person who is in exceptionally good mood, because
of a businese success and he was given a substantial
advance on his commission. After A and SABORI have
their routine two drinks, SABORI will state to A that
he would pick up the tab for the evening ( after being
treated by A so many time ) but he would want to
celebrate the occasion. It would be desirable that A
agrees on a drink or two to please S, but even if that
does not take place, it is anticipated that A would
want to accompany S. in his good humore. What ever
be the case, the situation lends itself to a free
talking, critical commenting and some bitching, juet
to play it big. It will be up to us. to prepare S as
to hew to run the conversation to get out of A a few
statements which he would not like his superiors to
know about.
c. As far as S is concerned I believe that he can be
persuaded to carry a transmitter on his person and
as a reason for requesting it we could tell him that
it represented a complimentary element to the PAQ which
he made on A, because the psychologist who reviewed
his PAQ conusernit essential to have a tape covering
one meet. There is no way of hiding the foot that we
will be recording what is transmitted, but we will
not have to give any explanation regarding how it
will be done.
d. I hope that one way or the other we will in possession
of a tape which could be used as a pressure factor.
From there on all becomes a matter of macupulation:
S may request a meet with A under the pretext that
that the people interested in the platinum deal sent
to E their speoinlist, who would like to clear some


154 3000
- 3 -
questions before opening the letter of credit and that
it war essential that the person who arrived here see
A, because that will strengthen S' position in the deal.
I mentioned the platinum deal because it would give
some common ground to the new person being introduced
on the scene, but some other story might be as good.
e. The new person showing up under the platinum deal
or any other pretext would be a case officer of ours.
I feel that such a person should at first sight show
that he was a Yankee, that he be versed in platinum
or what ever the pretext may be and that he should be
a Russian language speaker. I am inclined to believe
that after some business talk and after creating an
stmoepier of mutual understanding there would be no
problem for the case officer to start speaking Russian.
If A takes this fact in good mood and the business
conversation continues in Russian, S would be in a
position to excuse himself as a person who was no longer
needed. It is almost impossible to anticipate what
would be Ab reaction to the fact that S wanted to leave.
If insisted that S stay, we will have to accept it.
Nevertheless, S will be instructed to "go to the bathroom'
for a while and the case officer will have to use this
opportunity to drop his cover and go on with his job.
He will have in his pocket a reel of tape to counteract
Ab emphatic refusal ( which we must anticipate ).
f. It may be mentioned that S will not have to know
anything about the existence of the tape and as far
as the case officer is concerned S may have to be
satisfied with the explanation that the co. was the
psychologist who decided that he wanted to meet A in
person. Of course, a may not bear out this cover, but
that will be at the stage of
could not care less.
C. There is no doubt that S will be burned whether the


372
- 4 -
the things turn out right orwrong, but S will be left
only with guesses as to what transpired between the
case officer and A in Russian.
h. It is the fate of any officer making the pitch to his
be burned if the ergersice ends in anything less than
a success. Therefore, it would be worthwhile considering
to get a suitable language speaker case officer from
Eqs for this purpose.
6.
I am aware of the fact that tract the above discussed scheme has
a quite certain weakness in as much as it is built on and around an untested
asset as S is. Nevertheless, in terms of security and protection of Agency/
Station assets the scheme is advantageous, which is selfevident.
7.
It should be assumed that S might come up with some objections
when it comes to introducing another person to A from fear that he would
deal himself out of the game and terminate his usefulness to us. I do
not consider it difficult to put him st ease.

Agree that blackmail wor't work - but in reading file near thing that stands out
(to me at least) is the energy with which ABELEHARD pursues his career. Believe
he is ruthlessly ambitious to get ahead. If we are willing to burn SADORI, it
might be advantageous to inert senior Russian speaking staffer as suggested in this
paper (but without transmitter) who will make A offer to think over on long cold
Nicosow night's prior to his arrival at a new post. Our offer will consist of first
sowing seeds of discontent on fact that he is now 42 years of and has not risen
to the heights in his professional that he could have. (He is only listed as 3rd
Secretary while younger men are 1st and 2nd Secretaries ) I don't know his KCB
rank but it can be intimt'd that we know his rank could be higher. Talking fast.
we could then suggest to A thnt we will work out a elen in his absence whereby
we can aid his future career by putting with in his reth adventrepous situations
such as allowing him to "recruit" e U.S. official at his next nost. In return, he
wo:1d service our renuirements dring his tour. Our working relations in with A
could have a time limit with control factors on both sides. "No answer is wanted
now. Renort the approach if you wish. The offer will be good upon your arrival
at the new post wherever it is. (A, of course, will thing the talk is recorded
so there must be some way of assuring him it is not. SADORI, naturally, must be
absent.)
Not a bad idea, but He�nersheling

1. It is possible that Oleg had been planning to con-
tact me and had deliberately had placed himself in my
path.
2. It is also possible that Oleg, like all the other
Soviots, hates to spend money and would rather play with
another club member than to spend money on an instructor.
He may be trying to build up a group of friends or ac-
quaintances with whom he can

3. If he had been looking for me, it could be
that he has been asked to step in whore val failed.
That is, as an American friend, I never invited Val
to my home. He never met other things, I have
mo. Note, however, that I have invited me to his
home city. I am, when he did invite us frequently to
various events which were under the auspices of the
soviet embassy. We did not but rarely accept, One
such occasion was the Moscow circus.
4. If he had been looking for me, it could be
that he wants to assure his acceptance by our tennis
group where Gloria Pinto is a possible target. Oleg
has gotten to Gloria, but I am not going to
somewhere, I am not going to visit to sovicts, might be
very ordered a stumbling block. Perhaps he, Oleg, will
to reach all the other members of the group in-
dividually so that an invitation by Gloria to one of
our functions will meet with general acceptance.
SCENARIO OF CONTACT
I arrived about 0900 and took an instructor.
About 0950 Olegk arrived to play with and in-
structor on the adjoining court. He made no effort to
greet me. He had been pointed out to me by Val, but
I had not been pointed out to him do my knowledge-
though it is certain that Oleg and Jial must have
discussed the "players" in their"game" and counted
me as possibly on the most important fact is, I am sure
that Val has lost the most too long, but Oleg would
not have a lot to acknowledge this.
At 1000 my hour was up and I told my instructor
I was through--I did not want to continue for another
hour. As I was paying my instructor I noticed that
Oleg was paying his. It is very important to help
even bad form to take an instructor for less than
half-aN-hour. I am suggesting that he wanted to be
free for you. I'm not the meeting with me.
I set a course for one of the several gates
from the courts we were using. I could see that Oleg
had headed for the same gate (this could have been
perfectly natural) and at a speed which after some
thirty yards would bring him to the gate at the same
moment as I (this was not entirely natural).
Since I had an excuse to greet him, he being had
him pointed out in front of Pence Pinto, preceding
week, I did so. I maskt said Good Nornding and asked
if I could were here. He looked very pleased (I kthough
possibly involved) when I took the initiative and
recognised him.


377
oleg said that val had not arrived es far as
he know. I said I had been training to get ready for
Val. I waited my revenge for last week.
oleg seemed amused by this and immediately asked
if I would like to play with him since Val was not
here. I agreed. We found a court and played for about
one hour. O1g8 won 6-3, 6-4.
oleg is very athletic in appearance and played
and excellent game for someone who has played for
only two years (if this is true). He has enormous
muscular thighs. It escapes the that sport would
produce this, and the highlighting. Weightlifting
is out so, his upper torso, though muscular, is far
less developed than his legs. Basketball does not seem
likelihood to produce his particular kind of development.
oleg is pleasant. speaks excellent spanish. Has
not made any political comments (yet!). Seems more
intelligent, but less extroverted than Val.
oleg asked if I were with the American Embassy.
I answered"no, I have my own business". It was then
that he asked if I know another "Bill" who is in
private business and who 22 has an army rank. Oleg
thought the other person was a major.
I left at this point. Oleg stayed on to play
some pore. My wife could not see him and it is not
therefore, known with whom or how much longer Oleg
did play. Val was not seen during the course of the
morning. The Pintos are in San Francisco.

Contact Report
Subject: Jinny SADORI (P-13,830)
Date of Nect: Sept'10 et Sanborns-Lnfragus at 1700 Hire
1.
Prearranged meet and S canre 10 min carly.
NEXT MEET: Friday Sept 12 at Chex Rene at 2000 hrs.
2.
Instead of receiving the Agency Contract from the Noon Valley Corp.
Dallas, Texas, he received a phone call (his phone was connected) on
Sept 10 in the morning and was requested to sign the contract immediately
and return it by registered mail. The calor (Leater MacGhee) told S that
the contract was mailed "Registered-Noturn Receipt" on Mon Sept88 ". S con-
cluded that he expected receiving it on Sept 11, but more likely on Sept. 12.
3.
S was disappointed becouse he counted on 3noring the contract to
AEDENHARD that evening and the absence of the contract will necessitate
another meet with A when the contract arrives. FERNALD repeated to S that
he needed a Xerox copy of the seme and decided to meet with S on Sept 12
to debrief him on his meet with A and get a copy of the contract.
4.
S will not have much to report to A when he meets hia that evening.
S went to the Hotel Geneve where a friend of his used to be a manager and
was disenchanted when he found out that he no longer worked there. The new
manager did not want to show him the register of guests and his attempt
to spot a girl or girls who lived in the hotel and appeared to be working
bore no results, because all he was able to see or exchange few words were
tourists. S spoke to TANG by phone to inform his that the Luau manager
wanted to check with the embassy on the size of the add he was to place
in the monthly HISSIOH. TANG stated that he would take core of that and
he reminded S that WANG wanted to see the article before it was printed.
Other, than to capitalize on the info that Dcheverria would be the next
President of Mexico and speak about the platinum desi S had practically
nothing to report.
5.
F repeated the instruction he gave S on Sept 8 with regard to
stalling IS activities with A and as far as the platinum deal was concerned
it was made clear that his fair and aqudrill deternine our attitude.

Contact Report
Subject: Jimmy SABORI (P-13,830)
Date of Neet: Sept 8 at Ces Rene at 1400 Hre
1.
The meet was prearranged and S came on time. The meet lasted
about 3 hours.
NEXT MEET: Sept 10 at 1700 hrs at SAMBORN-Sla fragua if 8
does not request to see me earlier.
2.
S was advised by phone from Dellas, Texas, that the Moon Valley
Corporation was able to meet the Sov requirements concerning the platinum
deal and that they mailed on Sat Sept 6 a contract (agency contract) to
S which enables him to purchase 10 ounces of platinum per month from the
Sov seller ( an export company ). According to the same phone message
the contract provides for a US$3.00 commission per ounce.
3.
S hopes to receive the contract before he meets with AEDIEFARD
on Sept 10 at 2000 hrs. On his own initiative S decided that he would
want to show the contract to FERNALD before taking it to A. That was the
reason for arranging another meet with P before the scheduled meet with
A.
4.
The generous commission provided for by the contract enables
B to offer to A US$1.00 per ounce. Rven if the minimum required by Sova
is purchased a 1. - commission per os. would still net $20.000. - according
to S' estinetea. S antoipates that the purchasee would go above the
required minimum. E was taking in. consideration the possibility that
A would not want to accept any commission.ami Therefore, S came up with
a scheme by which there would be a bank account for A and the money would
be hie. whother he wanted it or not, or better said, it would be up
to his decide when he wasted to use it.
5.
At this point it may be mentioned that apart of the fact whether
the Sovo would want to close the platinum deal the entire above mentioned
account is etrielly F interpretation of what he was told over the phone

and only the copy of the Moon Valley Agency Contrast with S will clarify
many questions one would like to ask right now. Nevertheless, it appears
to be probable that sa Agency Cohtrast was promised to S.
6.
In spite of the fact that at the time of this writing one can
deal only with "ifs", it is worthwhile mentioning that S believes that
A would like to facilitate S to get the desl, because in that case S would
be on one hand morally obliged to him and on the other S would had
collected a nice cua of money. In turn this would make A feel that he
obtained a setisfectory control factor over S and the rest is quite ob-
vious. Other than reoccurring to methods which are quite rarely used gainet
people as S, we in a situation of a very inconfortable spectator left with
a hope or a which that A might go for the commission.
7.
As far as S'villingness to give to A the attractive chunk of
money is concerned he is doing it for a double purpose: to please us
(indirect protection of his interest) and to protect his interest directly
by assuring A's willingness to help him in getting the deal.
8.
Although, our situation is not plessent ( if the deal is to
materialise) we are not helpless onlookers. S mentioned that if it comes
to closing of the deal he will have to travel to Zurich, Switzerland, and
for that he needs a passport. How much S is aware of our control position
( by enabling him to get a pesport fast or dragging its granting) can be
best illustrated by the fact that he told P that he would certainly put
aside a worthwhile sun for P. Neddies to mention that F gave him a
dern good lecture
when he made his silly statement.
Nilly-willy P was obliged to turn weakness into etrength and S understood
that he could as well forget avout the deal ( if it comes his way ) if
he would not play it fair and square with us.
9.
S brought up quite reasonably the question that A would most likely
put pressure on him to get producing along the lines of essignments against
the US Eabnsey and as the first thing the question of obtaining the
Eabbassy phone directory would be thrown in S lap.
10.
P told S that because of the new development in the platinum
business P will allow S to follow An instruction in as to how to go about
getting the directory. F told him to go chood and look up all the USIS

girls he can find in the Hotel Geneve and report to A his findings. F point-
ed out that we demand from him to still as much as possible. On S remark
that he should have something to report to A when he sees him on Sept. 10
F commented that he will have no objection that S report his findinge.
11.
S really stalled all he was able in connection with the Chinese
Embassy: he did not go there at all, because he still did not obtain the
ad from the restaurant Luau.
12.
After the above conv S completed the PAQ, which is attached
hereto.
13.
S told F that his home phone was disconnected because he did not
have money to pay the bill of MN 632.- This happened at unconvenient time
because the Moon Valley from Dallas, Texes, was not able to reach him and
they were obliged to contact him through a friend my of his. F anticipated
that S would in one or the other way be asking for money and he had with
him a filled receipt for MN500.- which he gave him. F implied that he
would give him a couple hundred pesos more at his earliest convenience.
14.
Then, S spoke about the presidential race and stated that
the Gobernacion Seoretary Echevarria would be the FRI official candidate
and that the public announcement to that effect would be made on Sept 19.
F phoned this info to ARCHBOLD. See Attachment.

MEHORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
6 September 1969
FROM :CUBA/PBELEMENT 89
SUBJECT: Recent and Proposed Contact Between LIREALM-1 and AEDIEHARD
1.
At the 5 September 1969 meeting between LIREALM-1 and Andrew E.
PELLEMENT, the following information was received from and discussed with
LIREALM-1:
air
a. LIREALM-1, following Station advice
the the recent
incident where AEDIEHARD approached LIREALM-1 with an offer to pay LIREALM-1
for any information he could obtain from the U.S. Embassy, has avoided
contact with ADEIEHARD at the French Club. LIREALM-1's wife, an almost
daily visitor to the Club, has been asked by LIREALM-1 to note ADEIEHARD's
activities and associates and report anything interesting to LIREALM-1
b. MRS. LIREALM recently told LIREALM-1 that for a number of
consecutive Saturdays, ADEIEHARD had brought a young adult. LIREALM
1
contact with LIREALM-1. The LIREALM-1 was a member of the LIREALM
to determine the identity of the female, but reported the information to
her husband. She has noted no other items of interest in ADEIEHARD's
pattern of activities at the Club. He has not seemed to single out any
individual as a tennis partner, nor is he frequently seen socializing with
anyone in particular while at the Club.
2. LIREALM-1 was advised to be the Station had learned that AEDIEHARD
will be a member of the LIREALM-1 that for a monthly thought, but he will
probably remain in Mexico for another five months. LIREALM-1 was told that
this information was not yet public knowledge, but the Station would like
LIREALM-1 to confiro this if possible. This led to a general discussion of
LIREALM-1's association with AEDIEHARD since the recent incident. LIREALM-1
had been given to the LIREALM-1. He was a member of the LIREALM-1
AEDIEHARD, but rather that he not single out ADEIEHARD for special attention
or closely court his friendship. It is the writer's opinion that a sufficient
time has elapsed since the last incident for LIREALM-1 to again renew some
association with ADEIEHARD, another of the LIREALM-1. He was a member of
the LIREALM-1. He was a member of the LIREALM-1 board both belong (as has previously been reported)
to a group of tennis enthusiasts at the Club who take turns entertaining each
other in their homes. To date, all the members of this group have given parties
except LIREALM-1. Mrs. LIREALM, following theincident and thinking that AEDIEHARD
was a member of the LIREALM-1. He was a member of the LIREALM-1. He was a
home since he represents a government 80 opposed to the principles of her govern-
ment, etc. Based 00 AEDIEHARD's extension in Mexico and the fact that the LIREALM's
owe their friends a party, LIREALM was instructed to plan a party for the group
of the LIREALM-1. He was a member of the LIREALM-1. He was a member of the
LIREALM-1 should not focus an undue amount of attention on ADEIEHARD, but should
take advantage of the opportunity to renew their general friendship, and let the
matter, more or less, take it own head from there. As a first step in this
general direction, LIREALM-1 plans to go to the Club over the weekend of 6-7
September at times when JEEILHARD usually plays tennis to at least way hello.

3. A second reason why both LIREAMH-1 and his wife plan to go to the
Club is to seen if they can identify the new "girl-friend" of AEDIEHARD.
LIREAMH-1 says he almost always carries his camera with him when he goes to
the club and frequently takes pictures of his wife and their friends. Under
this pietext, he will try and take a picture of the girl friend if the oppor-
tunity presents itself where if will not come to the attention of AEDIEHARD.
4. LIREAMH-1 is preparing a written teport in some greater detail
concerning AEDIEHARD and his relationship with him since the incident. He
will also attempt to see if his can get any more details about the girl fri-
end from his wife.
5. The substance of the above including the idea for the party has
been verbally reported to C/5B and he is in accord with the plan for the party,
which will be, at least in part, paid for out of Station funds.

to the dumor.
S.
IJOYAL-1 fet certin thet LIEACO1-1 was very nervous during the
class and, especially, when he spoke about his met with
the for the, he went to the bathroom & times in an hour and
a half (he usually goes twice when served the sere sount of liquor),
This
local L-1 to scculato that there might be something fisby in the
consection with the dinner, including the orability that
requested to meet L-1 at IBLACOI-18 place and that his wife sroiled
the plans by limiting the number of people. To keep the matter from
development into wishful thinking I told L-1 that it was possible that
LIMACON-1 felt inbarrassed for not being able to invite him to the
dinner. L-1 cormented that LIEACOI-1 had no resson to toll him any-
thing about the dinner and if he kept it to himself there would had
been no reason for embarrassment. We agreed that there was no reason
to speculate, but to wit and sec. L-1 stated that his hores went high
because LIAACOI-1 told him that LADIERHART that stated that his departure
was J ectroned and that he did not count on leaving bofore the end of
December 169. Difficulty in finding a suitable replacement was given as
reason for postronement of departure.
7.
Recuirement: In view of the fact that LIEACOI-1 is used to
see at L-1s place visily which doed not have the tax tages (stome),
because he normally gets his from Octavio ( a Customs inspector in
Tatamoros), L-1 requested that I supply him a bottle of wisky which
entered the country tax free ( L-1 usually has the old far ).
8.
For his personal use I-1 would like to borrow a John Fliin
actologue, the issue valid after Aug 18,169.

Mexico, 2 Nov. 1970
Dear Valya,
( L 0611N 001)
It. doesn't seem to be true, but it is. I am witting a letter ((to you)).
Several times I got ready to write, but couldn't because of either lassiness
or too much work.
One and a half years have gone by oince you left. My wife and I remember
you often, more so, because there are practically all new and some very serious
faces in the Embassy (now)). I went to the reception on the Red Army Day, but
since I didn't have an invitation, they didn't let me in, even though CHERNYSH
and NECHIPORENKO tried to help me. As you see, my brother, times change. In
our days, i.e. when you were here, everything was simpler and I would say even
gayer.
Well, enough of complaining. I'll now turn to the news. The most important
news, at least for ma; is that Tega is expecting. We are waiting for the
"Parsien package" approximately in February. It would be nice to have a son,
since we are not going to produce more children. But if it is a girl, that too
would be nice. I will feel as though I am in a harm.
I am studying English and French seriously. In 2-3 years my wife and I
want to move to Spain. I have had enough of Mexico. I have been living here
for 14 years. On the other hand, with the knowledge of languages, one can earn
a better living is Spain. You know yourself that life is much happier in Europe.
Last year 21 million tourists visited Spain. One can make a good living through
tourism, and without much difficulty.
1 continus working in the Institute. We bought a good lot on Rin Street; and
built a chro-story butlding. Juan Luis's wife is also expecting their second
child.
Please extend our big hello to your wife. We reamaber her often. You have
bar
a very nice and hied vite. Looking forward to/your news, we embrace you.

DISPATCH
Chief, SB Division
SHO
Chief, European Division
FROM
Chief of Station, Bern
REDETOP INBREED: Request for Photos and Bio Data
KITCHEN HIGUETO-SEIREEDS
Reference : ESBW-13096, 14 November 1972
1. As requested in Reference, Station queried INBREED as to
why they had included Valentin Sergeyovich LOGINOV (201-0285412)
in their list of Soviets who had been PNG'd or expelled from
various countries in the past five years.
2. In INBREED's reply to our query, they stated that in the
periodic "Das Beste" there was an extract from the Reader's Digest
of 1 January 1972, of a booktitled "Moscow's Attack on Mexico" by
John Barron. From this article it was learned that the KGB officer
LOGINOV met secretly with Mexican students at the time of the
student demonstrations in Mexico in 1968. In March 1971, when
five Soviet officials were PNG'd from Merico, it was believed that
Valentin Sergeyovich LOCLINOV.
3. Upon learning that LOGINOV served in the Soviet Embassy
in Mexico City as Third Secretary/Vice Counsel from August 1965
to October 1969, INBREED has now advised the Station that LOGINOV's
name became erroneously appeared in their list of Soviets who had
been PNG'd.

Impresión general: ¿Cudi de las siguientes descripciones le
viene mojor:
12.02.01
Es hombre elemental, robusto, que no parece apocarse en
materia del sexo. Trata a las mujeres agropiadasanto,
pero hace poco esfuerzo por esconder su admiración y
atracción. Parece viril y confiado hacia las mujeres y a la
mayería de ellas les agrada.
12.02.02
Es hombre elemental, robusto, que ocasionalmente puede ser
burdo o hasta vulgar. Trata a las mujeres algo ásperamente y
puede volverse muy insistente cuando lo atrae una mujer.
Parceo estar muy orgulloso de su virilidad. Su agresividad
ofendería o repelería a muchas mujeres, pero eso a di parece
no importarle.

Soviet Concentional Contacts:
ALMIDATF made the following comments concerning what appeared to
hor to be cormctional contacts and/or notias operandi of Soviet Intel-
ligance cilibria in 'Munico:
Detriefting conducted 23-26 April 1970:
LOGIIOV - During the affair between AENIDRIFF and LOGIIOV,
they went to the movies once or twice a week, the Futurana and Cine Mod
being the theaters most frequently attended. LOGIIOV always trade some
sort of contact during these outings, according to AEMIDRIFF. She stated
that he usually left his seat about 2300 hours and went out to the lobby
for some time. She did not know where the contacts were actually made.
Once she and LOGIIOV encountered, apparently accidentally, outside the
Cine Mod theater, a Mexican Army Colonel, who was introduced to her by
LOGIIOV is "Col. Sergio." In this instance LOGIIOV did not excuse himself
to have a private conversation with the Mexican. "Col. Sergio" was de-
scribed by AMIDIRIFF as about 40, tall, no moustache or glasses, thick,
curly hair, appeared to be of Spanish descent. The vocan with "Col.
Sergio" appeared to be about 25 years old and was introduced as his wife
(which AMIDIRIFF doubted because, as she put it, he didn't treet her as
one would a wife, but rather as a nistress). AMIDIRIFF knew nothing more
about this Mexican and never saw his again.
On another occasion, LOGIIOV and AMIDIRIFF met an American in
front of the Futurana theater. LOGIIOV introduced him to her as "Col.
Michael." AMIDIRIFY stated that he was dressed in civilian clothes. He

had blend hair, was of zeudita height, no glasses, leape grey cyes.
(ASHIREFF thought his quite attractive). LOCINOY told "Michael" that he
vould cell in the next day ca urgent business. "Michael" was clone.
the they did not have a private conversation. She
estimated this encounter took place about September 1559.
COLCUST - AMTIBRIFF stated that COLCUST used her in the
same manner, i.c., teck her about 3 times in all to Cinc Chapultepce, then
left her during the nevis to make sces sort of contact.
Debricfing conducted 12-16 May 1970:
Concerning Soviet Contacts in the Nexien Folice: AMTIBRIFF
stated that she overheard GOLCUSSV and DUCMIN talk about many contacts which
they had in the police here. Sin said she had also overhead HOLCKWAXOY,
BARCLINI, AND CEMKIOV talk about how many good police contacts the Soviets
have. However, each specific example which AMTIBRIFF could give concerned
sone nou-operational favor which the Soviets could get taken care of, e.g.,
when the Soviets wanted to get something through Aduans; when some Soviet
was missing and police cooperation was needed; getting advance notice when
some demonstration hostile' to the Soviets was about to take place, etc.
She was not able to recall any hints that Soviets had operational contacts
in the police; agents reporting on what the police were doing; assets who
assisted Soviets operationally in scee way. However, AMTIBRIFF thought
the Soviets probably have such assets.
Concerning Soviet contacts in West German Police: AMTIBRIFF
recalled that when she vent to Germany as interpreter for Soviet surgeon
and textbook writer, Pablo AASST, in January 1963 (they went to Cologne

West Corcary on Commercial Ministry business), the Service Ambassador in
West Germany stated that the Embassy had scene and agents within the West
Cormen police the helped then to protect the Soviets (in context that it
was dangerous) there; some Soviet official could be kidnapped by the energy,
etc.) AEMINIFF noted that AMASOV was quite old and very pro-rindia.
Miecellancus unification notes - AEMINIFF had no knowledge
of Soviet safe houses or safe appartrants. She stated that many Soviet
visitors stayed at the Hotel Virrgeys or in two other hotels near the
Sovict Embasay (she couldn't remember newsa). She did not know whether the
Sovicts had any sort of special antingement or contents in these hotels.
AEMIRIFF stated that she had attended several parties at
which Mexicans also were present (she recalled specifically parties at the
homes of KOLCUMAROV, EAKULLII, LOOTINOV) and in each instance the Soviet
officer, at some point during the evening, had a private conversation with
a Maxican guest. (Unfotunately, AMIRIFFS was unable to recall the areas
of any of the Mexicans she met on these occasions, and of course there is
no way of knowing whether such private conversations were operational
meetings.) AMIRIFF' commented that at purely Soviet parties, husbands all
ways vent off together and talked business, and if vives approached, they
stopped their conversation.
Debriefing conducted 1-6 June 1970:
KONUNBECIII - AMIRIFF' concented that she thought KORWISBRI
ende operational meetings in the Bremen Bar, since she often say his
sitting in that bar, wearing dark glasses and trying to 10c: inconspicuous.

(AEMIMIF accretiaa passed by this bar and would look incide, altchough she
never want in.)
FUEHANOW - Possible PCE Contact - ALMIDRIFY stated that she
was told by Pincil Montiel (MENZK Montiel, 201-250951), the Soviet's
chauffeur, that his brother, who is a Central Committee number of the FCM
and who worked on the PCI publication "La Voz de Mexico, was in contact
with KUPILAKOV. In addition, AMENDIFF acted that she believed that
Armando VRAUGG (Iden with Armando MARTINEZ Verdugo, 201-851726) had an
uncle, also named Arancdo VERUGO, who is First Secretary of the FCM and
who is in contact with RUPILAKOV. At leout this was strongly inferred by
Montiel, according to ANINDIFF. (Editor note: Arnclo MARTINEZ Verdugo,
201-06425), who is brother of Armando, is First Secretary of PCM).
AMENDIFF stated that KUPILAKOV always seemed to be very interested in and
knowledgeable of what appeared in "La Voz de Mexico" and in the PCK publi-
cation "La Epoca." She stated that, in general, KUPILAKOV paid so much
attention to local politics and coerced to be so vell informed on PCM
matters that she felt certain he had something to do with the FCM.
AMENDIFF stated that KUPILAKOV's wife was a good friend of
Salvador CONZALEZ Morin, head of the Fondo de Cultura Popular. CONZALEZ¹
wife works in the Museum of Anthropology. CONZALEZ sold a lot of Soviet
books, according to AMENDIFF, and for that reason was in contact with
KUPILAKOV, but she commented that CONZALEZ may also have been utilized
by KUPILAKOV in some other operational way. Most of KUPILAKOV's contacts
seem to be journalists. (These were the people AMENDIFF saw talking to him
at receptions, etc.).

AREWAL worke with Eduado ARAWU (ecencule consultant for "Minera Conti-
nental S.A." centional in Censoreial office). She also stated she
know that ARWAL went at times to the Fabbasy to see KUMILWOWY. AEMIRIF
said that AREWAL goes to Moscow every year or so. (AREWAL identical
with Lopoldo ARWAL Fastar, 201-117959).

Soviet Invelverent in Studant
of 1009:
conducted 23-20 April 1676:
stated that
vont out : alghts often during this period and told her it was

was some of the most dangers he had ever donc. AMINIUFF was certain
that thace "contacts" involved in student riots. AMINIUFF related that
once at Auto Cinc, LOUING made a meeting with a group of youths who came
in another cur (Palccon). Another time, come 2 or 3 days later, LOGINTV
had MITOPOLISI give him seee shottgum which MITOPOLST had charge of.
LOOKOV got the guns about 2200 or 2300; the guns were returned-the next
morning. Others who seemed to be going out all the time at night during
the student riots (and talking atcut their meetings in general the next
morning ) were LORISIAOW, KORCUSSEKIN, NIKITOROV. AMINIUFF never heard
mention of money being passed during this period (i.c., to Soviet ascots
involved in riots) nor any mentica of any names or positions of assets
("this not in agreement with some of Stan James info). CHEKKOW seemed to be
involved also.
Debriefing conducted 12-16 May 1970: AMINIUFF was again
questioned on her knowledge of Soviet activities during the 1968 student
disorders. She reported that all she really knew was that the Soviets were
very busy during this period; that LOOINOV told her he was going out every
night to make "contacts;" that she overheard Soviet case officers talking
at various times during this period to effect that they very busy, making
many contacts; that the'situation was potentially explosive and a dangerous
time for them to be making such contacts, AECLEIFF twice was with LOQINOV

when he met vill. seue "youths" in private concentrations. However, ARILIPURF
stituted she did not ever huer any mention of any nance of Service contacts
in pelistien with the student disorders, any condition of the level of in-
volvement of these comitutes in the student organizations, any mention of
Soviet guidance to the student movement, financing of the student movement,
or the like. She really doesn't know that the Soviets had any contacts
with direct access to infomention to these activities, but the strongly
assumes that they did, based on their level of activity and the strong
tenor that LORIOY and other case officers gave to the idea that the contents
they were making were dangerous ones for than to be seen with during this
period.
Dobriefine conducted 1-6 June 1970: AIRIDRILIP questioned
re 1958 student disorders again, for clarification previously reported
details. She stated that the Soviets had socie different types of rifles
in the Comsorcid Office which served as sceples of guns which they were
trying to sell commercially in Mexico. Cea night about 11 o'clock, during
the period of student riots, LOGINGE ceca to the Comsorcidal Office with
NITOPOSIK (ASHDRIUF was there watching TV). They got "some" rifles -
AMIDRILIF could not see how many or what kind. They took them cut in some
sort of besa. The next earning "some" rifles were returned to the Com-
merciel Office, but AMIDRILIF doesn't know whether all of them were
brought back. She doesn't know whether or not LOGINOV night have been
duty officer for the Embassy for that night.
ADHILIFI stated that HIGHERKNO'S trip back to the USSR
during the 1958 ricts rcy well have been to report on the riots. However,
she didn't know that this was the case and soon specifically told her so.

"oscon, six ronths before the completion of his tour. He was head

not having had good results from his work and, according to Naya,
sore kind of failure. He was in "exico on two different occasions.
She states that during the time she was having an affair with Valentin
LORINOY, who was chief of the consular section, he occasionally took
her out at night to places where she knows he rade contact with persons
who scored to the 'exicans. She says that she doesn't know with which
persons he made contact, nor if they were "exicans or not, because she
never sar then, hut that he, on several occasions took her to these
places: the (ine "od on know Lomas de Tecomachalco, the (ine Futurana
in Colonia lindavista, the drive-in tienter called 'autocinema del valle,
the drive-in called Autocinem Satelite and the fine Tlatelolco. When
she accompanied him to those places, he left the car and she remained
in it; that he vould no for 10, 15 or. 20 minutes to converse with those
people. He never told her the these persons were nor what they talked
about.

Assessment of AEDIRARD
REVERKACES: A. HINHA 37833, 12 September 1969
B. TGA 3500, 10 October 1969
1. The two Personality Assessment Questionnaires on AEDIRHARD
which were transmitted as separate cover attachments to Reference
A vero unfortunately not received until 30 September, by which
date we knew from a vina cable sent the State Department by the
Embassy in Boryo City that ADDIEMARD was departing PCS one week
therefore, the U.S. Department of Rececece B confirmed that departure.
2. Since but one week was available for the completion of
the HICRUSH assessment, and its transmittal to the Station, we
decided not to go ahead with it. The PAQ's have been made a part
of AEDIRHARD's file, and should be appear in the future outside
the USSR, an assessment can be made at that time.

LIMACON-1 Progress Report

B. HUNA-36817, 26 March 1960
C. HUNA-36881, 8 April 1966
1. Forwarded herewith is Bruce E. FERNALD's progress report
on LIRACON-1, covering the period 30 January to 15 August 1969.
2. As FERNALD's report indicates, steady progress has been
made in developing LIRACON-1 into a responsive agont. LIRACON-1's
credentials vis-a-vis the Soviets are excellent. In the learning
to use these credentials to the Station's benefit. No was
reluctant at first, possibly because he did not want to do the same
thing for RYTOCCH that he refused to do for ARXICE. Patient handling
by FERNALD seems to have overcome this reluctance, and LIRACON-1
800 years ago.
3. So far, there seems to be no reason to suspect the sincerity
of LIRACON-1's relationship with RYPOCK. So developed strong
personal affection and prefeessional respect for both LARTA'SUK and
FERNALD, and his turnover to Douglas F. DITMANSON ou 14 August 1969
represents an effort to strengthen the emotional attachment, which
is a major role in the vision, by providing him with a case
officer who speaks his native tongue. And, although LIRACON-1's
private life in a sense, we will sketch closely to see that this does
not cause any greater problem than occasional missed meetings and
delays in completing assignments.
4. In the next phase of LIRACON-1's activity, we expect to
concentrate on two things:
a. Strengthening the ties with AEDIRARD (there have been
indications that AEDIRARD's tour may not be ending shortly
after all, in which case be will remain a prime Station target).
b. Spotting additional agent prospects, as suggested by
Reference A.

PROGRESS REPORT
Subject
: LIBACON-1
Period Covered: January 30 to August 14, 1969
1. LIBACON-1 was recruited by Samuel J. KARTASUK on January
30 and was handled by him until March 26. During this period
they held nine ops meetings.
2. Bruce H. FERNALD took over LIEACON-1 on March 26 and
handicd 4 h= to August 14, when he turned i. 1. cor to Douglas F.
DITMANSON. During this period 16 ops mooting were held.
3. After a fine recruitment jol KARTA.SUK also accomplishi 3 to
difficult task of converting LIBACON-1's agreement to we: for
KARTASUK personally into a regular working arrangement.
4. Of the nine meetings KARTASUK held with LIBACON-1,
actually only six were working meetings. Info was obtained on
LIBACON-1's personal background as well as his ops potential.
LIBACON-1 was GSSWIRLED with jatisfactory results.
LIBACON-1 was motivated to worry on the potentially prepared
to accept another hand of working this period the condition which
LIBACON-1 had been on his agreement to work for us was respected
to make that he would not be asked to report on his personal friends
which as Sianlards, his students, or Noxious to whom he is
evotionally :rtached). LIEACON-1 did complete for KARTASUK a
15-line wr:ten report on AEDIEHARD.
5. FERNALD encountered no problems in getting along with a:d
handling LIBACON-1, whom he got accustomed to following instructions
and to submitting reports in writing.
6. LIBACON-1's initial attitude was that he had.greed to work,
or more accurately, to assist his work against AKICK, but he
was devoted to the 100% of all away from everybody and everything
to be needed with AEKICK. Pe did not see AEDIEHARD for more than
four months, and when they met accéentially in a resort, LIBACON-1
was decisivolly turning down everything AEDIEHARD asked for. He

7. FENNALE movement in convincing LIBACON-1 that he should
maintain social or friendly personal contact with ADELEHARD and his
colleagues and that he could do it without either giving in to his
or their demands, or at the other extreme, without saying no to
everything they "anction 01 ask for. LIBACON-1 followed instructions
and vent to AFTEHEAPD's office to ask him why he had not called
the "safest" of the "safest" of the "safest" of the "safest" of
meetings with ADELEHARD in July, and on August 8 LIBACON-1 and his
wife were dinner guests of ADELEHARD and his wife at their apartment.
The ADELEHARDs agreed to come to LIBACON-1's place for a farewell
dinner in September and in the meanwhile LIBACON-1 and ADELEHARD
will meet, for a luncheon on august 29.
8. FERNALD insisted from the beginning of his handling of
LIBACON-1 that the latter prepare his sketches on the MIBARSHORS
ho knows that he was able to show a hold lived in the USSR.
LIBACON-1 prepared bio sketches, which are actually personality
assessments, on ADELEHARD, IDENTITY A, IDENTITY B, IDENTITY C, and
IDENTITY D. The latter two reports showed that he would also report
that he was a "safest" of the "safest" of the "safest" of the "safest"
earlier conditions. Further, FERNALD instructed LIBACON-1 to contact
a good friend of his (IDENTITY E) wheu the latter returned from a
longer trip to Czechoslovakia. LIBACON-1 carried out the assignment
well and reported (orally) about IDENTITY S's observations, inprosstons
and conclusions concerning what he sew And heard during his sty. r.
his country. IDENTITY E is also a good personal friend of LIBACON.,
S. From the above it can be seen that LIBACON-1 has devolopad
inte a person who has confidence in us, and he accepts without
reservations to the "safest" of the "safest" of the "safest" of the
"safest" of the "safest" of the "safest" of the "safest" of the
In analyzing LIBACON-1's written reports it can easily
be soon that LIBACON-1 takes his assignments seriously and when he
makes a statement about a person he is scrupulous about drawing
only that conclusion which can be corroborated with facts. LIBACON-1
" equally serious and reliable. when he reports about his meeting
with ADELEHARD: He first: reports the course of the seiting and

the "safest" of the "safest" of the "safest" of the "safest" of the
he uses b' rea knowledge and the knowledge of the person to relay
the actual meaning of the statements. FERNALD not only believes
that LIBACON-1's reporting is reliable, but he also feels that ore
can depend or. LIBACON-1 to use his knowledge of the ar's and people
to sepa; the appearance and verbiage from the facts, be they
good.
11. An assessment of the moral and political reliability of
LIBACON-1, from the point of view of his work and activity on our
behalf can only be favorable. The same cannot be said when ore
views his p.-oval life. In this field ho has many problems, which,

who in it comes to emotions he acts like a toon-ager. LIBACON-1
is aware of this fact and he ascribes it to the fact that he grew
under conditions of regimentation and moral terror; and when he
found himself in a world in which people live free and there are
us restrictions on personal and social rights. He is very

*Originators Comments: ALDIHLARD flatly demanded that LIEACON-1 intro-
duce him to LIOVAL-1, a request which LIBACON-1 was reluctant to

*ADULTILARD did not actually state that an introduction was important

(13) On 12 December 1968 two team members spotted Valentin
S. LOGINOV (known KGB) walking with an unknown Mexican male.
After LOGINOV departed the Mexican remained at a restaurant
for an hour appearing to be waiting for someone. The Mexican
finally departed after making a phone call and was lost in
heavy traffic. The team members obtained the Mexican's license
plate number from which he was identified as Ignacio VALLINA
Barros.
