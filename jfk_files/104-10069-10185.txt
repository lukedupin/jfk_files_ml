acoguarda bo built into any Opa Locka rqferral in order
that wo could minimize the possibilities for duplication
of effort and/or wiro crossing. This concept was readily
accepted by Maj. Watlington. It did not, however, strike
a totally responsive chord in Lt. Col. Causos. This was
noted but in order to proceed with preliminary arrange-
ments, REUREMAN put forth the proposal that ACSI was lighter
to
the
safety
of
the
list could then be used as a basis upon which refugee
screenings could be conducted. It was suggested that Col.
Kail would be the logical point of reference in Opa Locka
through which the referral system could be managed. In
this connection it was pointed out that once Col. Kail
identified an individual whom he considered to be
designed to the other, and the other, the other, this indi-
vidual to be referred to Lt. Col. Causes' covert unit.
At the same time Col. Kail would make arrangements to pass
to KUBARK representatives at Opa Locka and to Station
JWWAVE a copy of the Opa Locka debriefing of the individual
who had been referred to ACSI. Upon receipt of this in-
formation, it was suggested that the U.S. Government
Station JWWAVE would review the referral. If this review
revealed that the individual was not of operational
interest to JWWAVE and his primary access was not in fields
other than OB, no objections would be expressed relative
to ACSI retention and full exploitation of the body. Maj.
Watlington enpressed satisfaction with this proposal and
stated that he would be prepared to discuss it further
once his own job. He was personally review the func-
tional of the Opa Locka centre.

L. C. O. Causes stated that he felt that he had
established his equity in Ordonez through the name
trace procedure. Despite this, he had found that
Ordonez had disappeared from circulation; and, there-
fore, he assumed that we were debriefing this man.
e. Third Country Diplomats. REUTERMAN asked the
ACSI representatives whether they were currently
touch with any third country diplomats. Iaj. Wat ington
stated that ACSI had previously tried to have the
c-apabilities of the Spanish, Uruguay and the
c-apabilities of the Spanish, Uruguay and the
Canadian
with KUBARK had resulted in ACSI's being denied the use
of those facilities. As a result Maj. Wat ington stated
that at the present time ACSI was not in touch with any
third country, diplomats. On the other hand, ACSI was
interested in pursuing the third country claims.
His colleagues were also interested in actions with
chance of the most important actions with
the dissets. At this point Lt. Col. Causes stated
that he was very disappointed at KUBARK's refusal to
allow him to use the facilities of the Spanish, Uruguayan
or Canadian pouches) It was indicated that KUBARK under-
stood I. Col. Causes' reaction; however, the KUBARK
position was not a result of the fact that he was
not a result of a altered. The additional explanations which
were made relative to the security implications which
were inherent in the use of third country diplomats and
how misuse could affect long standing government to
government or service to service agreements between
ODYRE and free world countries did not make a impact
of the fact that he was not a result of the fact that the dispo
interpret KUBARK's refusal to allow him to use certain
diplomatic pouch phanels as a clear indication that
Tone-ot KUBARK's primary responsibilities in the liäni
area was to restrict and inhibit ACSI operational activity.
Once this attitude was identified no further attempt's were
made to persuade Lt. Col. Causes that our actions had
been taken in the best interests of the intelligence
communities.
I. Maritime Inilination of ACSI Argens. A dis-
cussion of those support services which (UKARK might
render to ACSI operations revealed that Lt. Col. Causes
was still understood in having JSWAVE iniltrate two of
his agouts into PIBRIHEN. In this connection the point
was made by ACSI that under optimum circumstances they
would prefer that JHWAVE assume responsibility for the
agents in the Miami area and then deliver them through a
single step in the first time. The first time of this
ACSI would reluctantly accept iniltratión of their agents
into any point in PIBRIHEN. Lt. Col. Causes was told in
very precise terms that JHWAVE would not undertake to
iniltratne any of his agents inco Havana. On the other
hand, we would consider any proposal for the influence
of the fact that the first time of this report is not
was made that in this connection Lt. Col. Causes had to
understand that our maritime capabilities were limited
and we were currently committed to the full exploitation
of these assets for at least six weeks in advance. As a
result any operational plan which he might submit to us
should be Layed to the argument that appropriately six
to eight weeks would pass before we could realistically
consider the servicing of his request. Lt. Col. Causes
agreed to project his operational plans within this frame
of reference.

G. Documentation. A discussion of the documentation
probiom relative to agent infiltrations rovaled that at
the moment ACSI did not have any documentation problems
which they felt warranted discussion at this session.
h. Coordination Forms. The discussion of opera-
tioal coordination revealed that ACSI was willing for
JEWAVE to coordinate locally those operational proposais
which might be received from Lt. Col. Causes. Once this
coordination was effected and if there were disagreement,
then the operation could be referred to the process of
headquarters of both ACSI. The process was taking
to
the
probiom
effecting coordination in ac-
cordance with procedures which had been agreed upon at
Washington would be sent to both JMWAVE and the ACSI unit
in Miami in the near future. In view of this Maj.
Watlington suggested that we not initiate the coordination
mechanism until these forms were on hand circa 1 July 1962.
i. W/T Assets. The discussion of the use of W/T
facilities in terms of PBRUNEN operations revealed that
the Miami ACSI unit did not have any W/T assets in
PBRUNEN at this time. On the other hand, Lt. Col. Causes
was
identified as the most important factor in the U.S. MEN. In
view of this he asked if JNAVE would continue to assess,
polygraph and train those individuals that ACSI thought
were suitable W/T candidates. It was indicated that we
were cortainly prepared to review all appropriate cases
and would render whatever support was required. This then
was
only
for
the
probiom
effecting
the
to monitor ACSI W/T transmissions from PBRUNEN in the
instances where the W/T operator had not been assessed,
polygraphed or trained by KUBARK. We indicated that we
would be glad to monitor such transmissions if we were
told in advance of the date, time and frequencies on which
the broadcasts were to be made. This then led to a dis-
tribution of the data, which was not a significant difference
C/V messages for ACSI agouts. Here again, we stated that
we would favorably consider any requests for C/V trans-
missions providing that we knew the content of the message,
the
identity of the agent who was to receive it, and the
agent's location and equipment which he might be using.
Lc. Col. Causes stated that in view of this discussion we
could anticipate that he would be loving requirements on
us in the event of the event of the event.
J. Secret Writing. A discussion of S/W techniques
revoked that it a request for the issuance of S/W were
revolved from their Miami representative it would be ro-
vlowod, and if ACSI approved the operation KUBARK would
be asked to issue a system. If JMWAVE agreed via local
coordination that the operation in question required the
use OY S/V, then this recommendation would be called to
our Washington Headquarters where coordination would be
effected with ACSI. Once this was accomplished, KUBARK
Washington would calc to JMWAVE the number of the system
which was to Do Issued. JNAVE would then issue the
system to the ACSI representative in this area.
The
information is not intended to allow a above discussion arrange-
ments were made for lunch, but not to. Col. Causes chose not to partici-
ate in the luncheon session. During the luncheon conversation
Eaj. Watlington indicated that he did not believe that Lt. Col.
Causes would cooperate within the spirit of the DCID's. As a result
he asked that JMWAVE be extremely patient with ACSI until such time
as Lt. Col. Causes retired and could be replaced. Maj. Watlington

indicated that the reitronent was scheduled to take place at the
end of September 1982. At the end of the luncheon session ar-
rangements were made for VENTONS to take Maj. Watlington on a
tour of Opa Locka. Based on this tour additional discussions
were to be held with Maj. Watlington particularly in regard to
the developmen of procedures for referral of agents to ACSI
from the Opa Locka flow.
4. OPA LOCIA. Maj. Watlington and JENTONS subsequently
went out to the interrogation center at Opa Locka. Here they
were not the same as the OPA Locka. The OPA Locka was the
part of Maj. Watlington, to assure himself that the ACSI repre-
sentative, Francai, was having adequate access to operational
loads. Col. Kail said that operational leads were shared ac-
cording to their abilities between the KUBARK representative and
the ACSI man. However, there were occasional difficulties in
assuring that the men best qualified received the body in question.
The OPA Locka was a major challenge to the OPA Locka. The
Center without his completing the full treatment which precluded
the ACSI representative's getting his hands on someone who might
be well qualified for their operations. Maj. Watlington believed
that assurance that the ACSI representative got a fair deal
night be achieved through a more complete briefing of Col.
Trudencio Ulibarri, who is in charge of the preliminary screening
of OPA Locka. The OPA Locka was a major challenge to
JENTONS
said that this would be a very good idea, but that it would be
better if it were a dual briefing with a KUBARK representative
being present as well. Maj. Watlington said that he would ask
his headquarters for permission to have such a briefing given.
Col. Kail expressed his opinion that the assignment of JENTONS
to formal liaison with the ACSI representatives would do much to
eliminate present difficulties and all present echoed this pious
thought.
5. AGREEMENT. When JENTONS turned Maj. Watlington over to
Lt. Col. Causes after the meeting at Opa Locka, the two ACSI
representatives said that they believed that, for the time being,
it would be better to continue the system as at present, pending
JENTONS' permanent arrival at the beginning of July 1982. As Lt.
Col. Cause is obviously skeptical about the outcome, this was
agreed to as a stopgap measure.
