Dear Charles,
Thank you for your letter of 15 October
recommending against the declassification of
Warren Commission document CD-971. I might
mention that our inquiry to you in August (1968)
was in anticipation of further pressure for the
release of Warren Commission papers, a pressure
which has not materialized. Accordingly, there is
not, at the present time, any intention to release
CD-971.
Should the quostion be raised at some future
time, the points made by you in your letter provide
every reason to keep the document out of the
public domain.
With kindest regards,
Sincerely,
18/ Richerd HeIns
