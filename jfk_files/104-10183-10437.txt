Office of AMWHIP-1, 31 W. 47th St., New York, N.Y.
PRESENT: AMBUNNY-1, AMWHIP-1, and DAMICONE using alias of
Al MARIN
1. I had introduced AMBUNNY-1 and AMWHIP-1 to each other
21 May but the office was crowded, so there was very little
one of the other success operational matters. We met again
on the above date, the 19th Street, and the 19th Street, who
to meet in private. Although AMWHIP told me that he was
delighted with AMBUNNY-1 herself, as he said the 'Cubans
like that kind of girl -- not too fancy', he thought that
her background -- particularly her previously working for the
08
years, he said that 1991 were the 1991 and 1992. He said
risky. He said that 1991 were discovered that AMBUNNY-1 was
a penetration of the UNNBAFU-19 office (by the Cubars) his
connection with ODYORE would thepbe revealed, with the result
that all his "connections" with UNNBAFU-19, and "Habana" would
be lost. AMWHIP-1 opined that he thought it likely that the
Cubans' time was not in the 1991.
2. AMWHIP suggests that 1985 (possibly of using a cutout
to introduce AMBUNNY-1 to the (UNNBAFU-19 installation. He
said he would explain that all at a later time, that he
meant, obviously not wanting to reveal any more than necessary
to AMBUNNY-1.
3. Also, AMWHIP-1 stated that he was unable to travel
to Paris before mid-June, as he had some relatives coming
to visit him from Italy. After checking with DI UBALDO,
I subsequently informed AMWHIP-1 and AMBUNNY-1 that the
15-4
(AR10) operation was off. Both expressed relief. I told
AMBUNNY-1 that she could most likely still be utilized in
12-2 (Habana) that we would discuss the possibilities at a
tate? Date.
