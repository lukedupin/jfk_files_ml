SUBJECT: Oruzhinnik and Operativniki, Voluntary Civilian
Hittia-Patrolmen
SOURCE : (201-0948382) a foreign-language student from
Minsk, two worked in numerous jobs throughout
the USSR. Born in 1943, he emigrated in 1976.
Neither his. bona. fides nor his reporting reil-

DATE OF INFORMATION: 1969-76
DATE OF LITERVIEU : 26-28 April 1977
1. The druzhing is a group of civilians who volunteer
to assist the militia in maintaining public order. Although
the druzhiny originated spontaneously in about 1962; the
have since become official appendages of the military. There
is at least one druzhina officer of the public and commercial
entertainment, the technical school. Although the
technicians officers are supposedly elected, they actually are
appointed by the administration at the factory. A duty to
is posted. Almost everyone except the management has to be on
duty at one time or another: no one can refuse. They, very
nard to make people, especially the factory workers, is room the
streets on druzhina duty after a day's work because they would
rate "go back."
In the institutes the druzhiny operate this way.
After lectures all the students of a particular department have
to attend a compulsory meeting, the non-unionist, but the
institute is in charge of meeting, together with the senior
druzhininist, the secretary in the departments. Those students
were the same reason did not manage to escape this duty (using
a medical excuse, influence with the chief, or other member of
are then marched to the nearest druzhina post. The media dozens
of such posts in each rayn (precinct) of the militia, usually
in the bascments of apartment houses. Initially there is an offi-
cer of the militia there, with several militiamen of lower ranks.

3. At the druzinia post, each-druzinnik gets a red arm
band to wear. Then, they are dispatched to different locations
to patrol and uphold public order. What actually happens is
the first time. The time of the streets for a while, then return
the red arm bands and go home, dot all of them, however, just
walk around for any number of reasons (desire to get ahead,
and the world, or exercise of a little power) is the most
grabble to the other. The time of the street is the most drunks,
and the time. the post. Source: himself was taken in several
times to such a post. Inere a miltia officer fills out a re-
port and does not even try to listen to the detained person's
explanation of what happened. If you do not know the
time, the time of the street is the most of the fine of five to ten
rubles and a report to your place of work which will cause you
to lose any bonus pay at work. If you try to argue to prove
your innocence, then the action is more serious. A patch of you
that periodically visits the time of the time of the time of the
time of the street. The miltia- nolds you all day. In
the best case, you have to pay a fine of ten rubles, and in the
worst case, you receive fifteen days of confinement with com-
pulsory labor, only if there was nothing criminal in your be-
navior. If there was, then you get a trial and a jail sentence.
4. If the druzhinikk do not bring anyone in, they are
criticized for not doing their job conscientiously. Another
reason for pressure on them, in Source's opinion, is that the
government needs the money from the fines.
5. Some of the more active druzhinink are offered jobs in
militia after graduation.
6. Source heard about another organization, the opera-
tivntiki, but he does not know the difference between them and
the druzhininkii. It seems that the operativnik are a little
higner in rank. They meet the secret, no one announces their
meetings, or the names of the members. Ho one knows or talks
about.
7. In the Institute of Foreign Languages, the chief of
the operativnik was Vladimir SHUNRIKOV, born 1939, about 186 cm.
tall, sturdily build, an atiete (former snotputer) with the handsome,
short way hair, dark eyes, large features, and airways. All you
but somewhat hard facts. The time of the street, all daya in 1973, speaks
to the other. The trees to drink, always hangs around the for-
eigners at the sport meets. SHUNRIKOV has been a Party member
since 1973. Source saw him several times with Yevgeniy SURGATOV
(KGG) in a Hinsk bar. SHUNRIKOV also knows KCB senior lieutenant
Anatolly Alexsandrovich K&SENOV.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Selection and Recruitment of KGB Officers, Agents and 43
Informers in the Belorussian SSR
SOURCE : (201-0948382). a foreign-language student
worked in numerous jobs throughout the USSR ban in 1629
he enigrated in 1976. Neither his bona fides
porting reliability has been established
DATE OF INFORMATION 1972-1976
DATE OF INTERVIEW : 26-28 April 1977
1. Source obtained most of the information in this report from
Anatoly Aleksandrovich: AKSENOV, a KGB senior lieutenant who was in
charge of the KGB unit in the Tcublileynaya Hotel in Minsk, and from
friends and: classmates who are now KGB and militia officers.
2. Source's curiosity about the selection and recruitment of KGB
personnel was aroused when AKSENOV told him that he was considering
the same situation. The most important Source asked AKENOV
who is selected and for what reasons, he was in charge of the
usually uses spotters, who recommend people for recruitment. Back-
ground is important. A person from a peasant or worker's family is
not a very good choice, and he must either be a quiet and colorless
type who blends into the same color. The most important source is
else a conspicuous loudmouth who asks embarrassing questions. The
latter would be more likely suspect of being a member of the opposi-
tion rather than a KGB informant. The average informant, according
to AKSENOV, is not very bright because KGB officers themselves are
not particularly intelligent and are afraid of anyone who is smarter
than a KGB informant. The most important source is the most important
source.
3. Both Source and AKSENOV think that in the remote areas of the
USSR there are very few cases of such a recruitment pitch being
turned down. Far from the big cities the KGB is an all-powerful
instrument, and anyone who refuses just to report on the conversations
and friends in the name of patriotism will end up with dismal
care. The most important source is to begin in high places, it
is unlikely that such a person would build for a KGB recruitment
pitch in the first place. Therefore most of the other levels of the
KGB consist of people from simple backgrounds for whom there are no
other career prospects and who prefer this kind of service to being
in the Army.
4. The KGB officers in the Belorussian SSR are also those who
are not bright enough to make a career in some other field, such as
science, engineering, or foreign languages, but they differ from
the lower-level cadres in that they are the sons of high-ranking

Party and Government officials. This is why so many of
Beveringham dignitaries work for the KGB. Otherwise they would be
needed to jobs which would k, thomn it most. 120 rultes per month
for the rest of their lives, even if they could survive the competi-
tion in a Party job. In the KGB, an officer, who achieves such
status by going through a school can look forward to: steady
promotions until he reaches the 100% of the 100% of the 100% sponsor
of the 100% of the 100% officer can eventually be promoted to
lieutenant colonel or even colonel before retiring Also, it is a
prestigious interesting, and financially advantageous job which
places the KGB officer above the common people to the other
mainly. The KGB officer is a very good job. The work of the
military area often supplemented by discreet cooperation with black
marketeers, who pay off either in goods or a percentage of the take.
And there are the services of the women who sleep with foreigners,
for money or for other considerations and who report to the KGB.
So, a person in the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% is. hotel little
the fubileynays, actually presides over a small kingdom.
A KGB officer meets each of his agents (filer was the word
used by the KGB, but she safe house. (konspirativnaya kwartira). Other
officers are not supposed to know who these agents are, and this
"conspiracy" is a matter of great pride to them. Source was once
caught leaving the hotel room of a Bulgarian girl with whom he had
spent the night, but he was released when he gave AKSENOV's name to
the junior KGB officer on duty (thereby implying that Source was on
assessments) and the KGB officer.
6. Source described KGB influence as "overwhelming". For example,
a Soviet going abroad on an official assignment cannot refuse to
cooperate with the KGB because such refusal would mean that the
person wouldn't be able to travel, as the KGB has a say about his
final clearance. Source also gave the example of the KGB officer an
unimportant job with the Minsk Symphony who was or originally turned
down. But when, AKSENOV spoke to the KGB officer responsible for the
Symphony, the applicant was not only hired the received the greatest
employment. And the Symphony Director during the entire period of his
employment.
7. The KGB likes to recruit retired military personnel (otstavniki)
because they are considered politically reliable and patriotic.
Many otstavniki recruited by the KGB are former Osobyt oded! (Special
Section, security functions) people, so KGB work is not a novelty for
them. Such retirees are frequently used in stationary positions,
respectively. The KGB officer.
8. Since the KGB relies on spotters for the selection of its
agents, the spotters themselves can get into trouble if they recommend
the "wrong" person. This means that the spotters are afraid to select
clever people, so in the end they select mediocre ones. Selection
is determined by the following: if the prospective agent or informer
is a kolkhoznik, he is immediately 50% qualified. If he was in the
Army. particularly in the Dosbyy otdel, this adds another 30% other
qualifications are based on the person's being 'quiet", 'average",
or "ordinary'.
S E C R E T


9. The spotter is supposed to turn in a list of potential recruits
and write a recommendation for each person. The prospect for
informer is then called in and an offer to cooperate with the KGB
made. Source never heard anything about money being mentioned, but
the KGB does offer help in the advancement of one's career. The
initial assignments are very simple: The agent or informer just has
been the most important role in the development of a new product
anti-government or illegal activity who can refuse such a call to
patriotic vigilance? And if one does, he might well be classified
as an enemy of the state and end up doing the lowliest physical labor
rather than enjoying a promising career.
10. AKSENOV also told Source that the KGB usually opens a file
on a Soviet citizen who corresponds with anyone abroad. After this,
his telephone conversations are monitored and periodically recorded
And finally, KGB agents and informers who come into contact with
him. He asked to regard the fact that he was.
11. He said he was a KASENOV what the KGB would consider its
greatest accomplishment. AKSENOV replied that the discovery of a
secret agent (nelegal) would be first on the list, followed by the
discovery of an illegal printing press. Without printed matter a
revolution cannot take place, according to AKSENOV. Third on the
hand, he was a KASENOV. The second one was a KASENOV
such as a rifle or pistol. This last item would not be considered
particularly important in itself, but a KGB officer can do very well
for himself if he plays his cards right. He must time the discovery
of the illegal weapon with a public event involving the visit of an
unification of the use of a new product. The most of the eyes of his
superiors, his discovery is tantamount to thwarting an assassination
attempt. Any one of the three accomplishments would lead to automatic
promotion, a medal, and tenure for life in the KGB.

system at the Belorussian State University.

8. RESIDENCE IN THE USSR: From before 1966 to his
emigration, UZLOV Jived at 47 Volgogradskaya ulitsa in Minsk.
9. EMIGRATION: UZLOV emigrated from the USSR on 28 November
1976. He arrived in Rome shortly thereafter, and departed for

10. PRESENT SITUATION: UZLOV currently lives at 414 Avenue.
N., apartment 68 in Brooklyn, NY 11230. He is unemployed.
11. PERSONAL EVALUATION: UZLOV is a smart, witty; outgoing,
aggressive person, accustomed to living by his wits. He is
willing to take chances and play roles, but, at the same time,
he is not afraid of hard work, as long as it pays well. He is
somewhat given to romanticizing, for example, by seeking a job
of
the
work
and
the
work
and
the
work
and,
often, dull job. He is not persistent, not able to stick
to his studies or hold a job; instead, he prefers to work hard
for shorter periods to earn money, and then do nothing.
UZLOV seemed to be completely won over by the United
States, saying that he is willing to do anything that would be
asked of him, such as his voluntarily bringing in photographs
on the other personalities he described, and suggesting that
he would try to make a good deal of interest. He is also
with his friends back in Minsk to obtain information for us
if we so require. At the last possible moment, he admitted
that he was incarcerated in the USSR for participation in a
fight, but was later found innocent by. a higher court.
Physically, UZLOV is good-looking, trim, athletic,
and is a former boxer, who trys to keep himself in good shape.
He likes to dress well and, seemingly, no longer drinks to
excess, as he used to do in the Soviet Union.

Source without making any report, because Source's report

all rooms occupied by foreigners are listened to by a spot check
from the time that the occupant enters his room. There is apparently

SUBJECT:
OI Requirements for Interviews of
Soviet Emigres
REFERENCE:
SAG Memo. Dated 8 April 1977
1. Reference alerts us to provide OI require-
ments for SE/SAG/OP's scheduled debriefing of two
Soviet emigres-Sergei UZLOV and Boris PALANT. We are
keenly interested in what these two persons have to
say about the young people. We are not aware of
the number of people, quality and proceeded to posts
in Africa, as several of these names are familiar to
us as leads. We are even more interested in background
and assessment data on the three military instructors
TARASENKO, LIPIN, and VOROBEV, who are currently in
Africa and of interest to this branch.
2. In addition to straight bio and assessment
data, we would like answers to the following:
A. What were the career and personal
objectives/goals of these young persons who
accepted assignments for the current school
school, and the scientific/sociological/anthro-
pological differences/difficulties they would
encounter in Africa? Did they accept their
assignments primarily to save money? Were
any of them looking upon their African assign-
ments as a form of "escape" from the Soviet
Union? Had any of them ever mentioned suffering

mis treatment by the KGB or the Party?
B. Did the two sources have the oppor-
tunity to talk to any Soviet interpreters?
who had returned from the U.S. to the
U.S. to the U.S. to the U.S. to say
climactic/sociological/anthropological problems
they had encountered there, and how they handled
them? African assignments are particularly
difficult to have a "strong" role in the
populations in Africa. Because this inability
to adapt to African conditions is operationally
exploitable, we would like to-learn as much
about it as possible. We would also be inter-
ested in what they said about their duties as
interpreters.
