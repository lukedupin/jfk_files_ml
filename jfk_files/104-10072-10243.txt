2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
24 April 1970
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Meeting With WUSLAB/1 on 22 April 1970
1. Arrangements and Security: The meeting took place
in the [office]Safehouse at 1400 on the above date and ended
at 1500. There were no incidents of a security nature.
2. Production: Bolivian Ambassador Julio Sanjines
Goytia talked on the phone to president Ovando on 20 April.
Ovando said that there was pressure from the civilian members
of the cabinet on the Debray case. They related their request
that Debray should be released to a letter Ovando wrote the
Italian novelist Alberto Moravia which they claimed stated
he would release Debray. Ovando commented to Sanjines that
he had not committed himself to release Debray. The civilians
think that the release of Debray and Bustos would take the
present of the government. Ovando admitted that the govern-
ment could not control the students. The Minister of Education
had been destroyed when the USIS installation was damaged.
Ovando commented that he would reconsider the Debray situation
and commented that there were no legal precedents for Debray's
release. The military will go along with it if Ovando and
the cabinet will put down the union members if needed. Marcelo
Quiroga still claims to be able to influence a segment of the
mineworkers. Ovando does not want to suppress by force the
student demonstrations. Ovando indicated that there is a wave
of uneasiness in the country. He is thinking about taking a
stronger hand in certain issues and compromise on other issues.
3. Minister of Planning Jose Ortiz Mercado is coming to
Washington on 2 May for a four day visit before he goes to
San Jose for the inauguration of Pepe Figueres. ( WUSLAB/1
believes that Ortiz will be [frankrwith him] and tell him what
the situation is like back in La Paz. He will attend the
CIAPreview of the Bolivian program.
4. Sanjines described the Rogelio Miranda Baldivia
problem (Miranda is the Army Chief of Staff in Bolivia) as
a personal matter which has now become ideological. He does
not get along with General Juan Jose Torres, the Commander of
the Armed Forces. Miranda is now trying to change some
commanders in field commands.
