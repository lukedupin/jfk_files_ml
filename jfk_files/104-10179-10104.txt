Liami, 3 Oct 62
REPORTING
SUBJECT: Cira
Kanuel RAY.
SOURCER: Marta DIZZ Rivas, Hurrici to Dr. Mecardo MACHNII. Tas connect
in Havens with various anti-Communist organisations.
On a visit I made to source, she told no that she had not Mrs.
Cira MARTINIES in Havens. That Irc. MARTINIES used the clandectino
pseudony "Josefinn" and was married to architoet Trank MARTINIES.
That both subject and her husband were persons in the absolute
confidence of cinciner Mencul RAY, and "Josofina" had boon RAY's
secretory for a long time.
Source claims to have learned from "Josofina" that cho was
discasified with RAY's political actions, to the extent that RAY
wanted her to join the executive of the organization J.U.R.E. but she
had refused because she did not agree with the of this
organization. That "Josofina" had described this organization as
a political movement the sano as Castroism, only changing the name
of the leader. That sho moose the plan of this organization is to
organize all anti-BARTCIA and anti-CASTRO organizations, under the
direction of the J.U.R.E., and develop a tunctionalictio and copcially
an anti-Amrician policy in order to bo able to group all the clements
existing in Cuba that have not figured prominently in the CASTRO
ragine. After the fall of the OACTO: rocine they plan to form a,
strong political party in Cuba and capitalizaio on the mictakos committed
by the provisional Government. With this objective in mind, they will
stay专parated from the C.R.O. and from all relationo with the U.S.
Government in order to be able to carry out their plan freely.
Mrs. Circ MARTINIZ lives with her husband at 1004 N.E 17th St.,
Miami, phono number F.C-0403 on which they talk to many persons
related with RAY's plan.
HOT: One of RAY's most trusted leaders in Miami is still Osorio
DAVILLA, former treasurer of the 26th of July Novement and men in the
absolute confidence of Haysco SAINTIAL. Tor a long time DAVILA was
the Chief of the Havens Emigration Department, until 10 onco to the
U.S. by bont from the coest of R-tenno. Some days ago I submitted a
detailed report on Ocorio DAVILA, and also on
and many other

nomin ledders of J. U.R.L., because there is another group of
individuals whose nanes are not adverticed but who have commend powers
in the J.U.R.E. One of these men is Eumcio LEMON, former leader of
the 26th of July Novement, private secretary of the Comnisciorer
of
Javenna Jose LLAUUA, and G-2 delogate in Havena Ocity Hall. LENO
persecuted many persons in the City Hall because he was the one who
made the licts of persons who should be rached, to the G-2. He also
had close connections with the Minister of the Interior, Jose 1.
NARANJO, then he kept informed about the persons under nucicion who
worked in the Ministry of the Interior. One time LENDON vicied KARANJO
and informed him, in the presence of MARNJO's cocratory, Lacy
CHEVIRNRIA, that he should keep Captain Raman FADILLA, at that time
Chief of the Iclo of Pines prison, under surveillance. In 1960 FADILLA
was preparing the ecceage of Captain Jorge SOUS, and thanks to Lacy's
warning PADILLA took preconutions and the plan could be carried out.
Imnocio LIDON lives in limni but I don't know his home address.
Although he Inter declared himself ca criti-Communist, and I think he
sought asylum in the Brancilin Embassy, I have no trust in him at all.

sould
On Sunday, October 28, I set twice with Manklo RAY of the Kinyrianto
Reyriaductural's deal Pueblo (NIP) at the San Juan International Hotel, in
San Juan, Peete Rico, My main objectives were (1) to be a
list of Oubane, presently associated with the Castro regime, who are
critical of Castro and might be considered potential directors; (2) to
:imin a list of tubans, either inside or outside the island, who could be
237allals, in case of an emergency, to help, in setting up some kind of
provisional government; and (3) to have his general views on the possibility
of an emergency.
Since I had arranged to return to Washington on the same day, I did
not give Ray muo idea to do a thorough job. However, he was able to
furnish me with a list of names, covering points (1) and (2). He promised
to provide me with additional information after checking with some of his
associated in New York and Miami. His thoughts on the possibility of an
insurrectionary movement will be the subject of a separate memorandum.

the Cuban Government. I add ay own comments in parenthesis, based on
