Sumpany of Initial Missions
In the period from 20 June to 10 July 1956 the Soviet Bloc air defense
system ras subjected to eight penetrations of air unprecedented nature, seven
occurring within a period of only eight days. It must be remembered that
24
(2011) provides the only basis of the defense of the Soviet
system. This is the most active issue it is clear from REGAL material that

consistential defense business is conducted over landlines and thus not
deserved by COMIT. However, some tentative conclusions ray be drawn from
these initial flights and these are indicated as follows:
1. In spite of the fact that these missions came as a surprise,
None of them went undetected. This is clear evidence that their
rader coverage extends above (70,000) feet.

2. By 5 July 1956, the fourth flight, the USSR was aware
of the purpose of the missions and were taking counter action.
One positive action was the standard of civil flights while the
mission aircraft was over the USSR, and second action which is
believed related is the moving of MIG-15 aircraft into East
Germany and Poland on 7 July 1956. Also MIG-19's were moved
into Hungary at the 1956.
3. The performance of the Soviet system on the 5 July mission,
2011, the need curious. While the action evident from 24
is not clear an explanation which appears to fit the mission.
is offered as follows: As a result of the provisions, the
Soviets had concluded the essential fact that concerning the missions,
1.e., that they were not to be the most important that they flew above (65,000)
24
feet, and that they were that the system was possible. They
were not used that the 5 July mission was headed. For the
when
the track appeared on a northeasterly heading the system of the
target when it entered Soviet system, probably deliberate and
the "red herring" to the system to the west was either a dogge
or a woman who is to avoid broadcasting a track for all the system
and was "hostile or intruder" was coming over the system.
The
means available to stop it. This idea is to be used by the use
of a raid number assigned to the joint just beyond the point
99
where the track had "lost". In addition, the track was not
obtained in the 10th interdurer" When it was broadcast after it
had passed beyond Moscow. The reporting of the system did
appear was only by Moscow and it has suggested that other
stations had been instructed to broadcast the track. Further, it may
or may not be a cointry that the height broadcast was almost
exactly half of the virtue altitude of the mission aircraft, but on
the next mission, four days later, the altitude reporting was
consistently possible to 50,000 feet.
4. By 9 July 1956, in addition to the evident recognition of
the great height of the mission flights, tracking was better and
in general the performance of the warning system was much improved.
5. The last day, 10 July 1956, the Soviet air defense warning
system closed a 3000 mile track with only two short periods of
confusion to track loss. Altitude reporting was over 60,000 feet
with one plot passed 68,800 which was only 100 feet off target
during the first eight missions proved that the air defense warning
system is deployed in depth. This was evident from the continuity
of track and most forcefully from the ELIT in the 3000 mc/s band were

7. Confusion and track loss seemed to be related to the 99
presence of large numbers of fighters although the seturtion point
has not been determined because of insufficient data.
8. The question of redars for height finding, the capabilities
of TORKIN in this role, the introduction of ROCK CAKES and later
developments are discussed in another section. It is believed,
however, that these missions were a catalyst in the introduction
of ROCK CAKES.
