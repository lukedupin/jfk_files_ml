DATE OF MEETING: 27 June 1967
1. I met Subject from 1300-1430 on 27 June at the Capitaltrano Restaurant.
I paid him $2,000 M.N. as his salary for May and June. The next meeting is
set for 25 July at 1300 at the Capitaltrano.
2. Subject conducted 14 classes at the Soviet Embassy during the reporting
periods.
1 June
1530-1700 - BERRIN, CONGHARENKO, ROVANCHERKO. Subject asked if
KAZARTSEY had gone out of town, as he had told Subject he would probably
do, BERRIN re-illed without hesitation; that KAZARTSEY had gone to Moscow
and wouldn't be back until about 15 June.
6 June
1530-1700 -- BERRIN, CONGHARENKO, ROVANCHERKO. Toward the end of
class, BERRIN said there were two men who wanted to speak with Subject after
class. Following class, two men Subject didn't recognize came in and
CONGHARENKO and ROVANCHERKO left. The two men were introduced as Vladimir
SOKOLOV and Pavel KOVALEV. BERRIN explained briefly that they also were
interested in taking English lessons, and thereupon left with the comment
that he didn't believe he was needed. SOKOLOV was the first of the twomea
to speak, repeated that he and KOVALEV wished to take lessons; and then
turned things over to KOVALEV, who, he said, spoke better Engi than he
KOVALEV proceeded to state that he had served in Washington, D.C; for three
years, had served an earlier tour in Mexico, and had been tack in Mexico
for about a month. (KAZARTSEY later said he and KOVALEY had served in

Washington at the same time.) At one point
referred to SCHOLOLY
as his " SMOLICY intetected but he was leaving Ixxico "sometine
this year and anted to crush up on his English in preperation for the
4th year British proficiency test he would have to take when he returned to
the USSR. Subject and that on the whole, he got the impression that KOVALEY
was replacing SOKOLOV. A schedule of two classes a week, from 1800-1930
on Tuesdays and Thursdays, was agreed upon. One of the two Soviets mentioned
that the funds for their lessons would come out of the military department.
1715-1830 - SOKOLOV and KOVALEY asked when Subject would suggest
it by have their first lesson, and Subject replied that since KAZANTSEY was
away, they might as well begin immediately. The Soviets readily agreed.
Subject described KOVALEYS English as good. His grammar is a little better
than KAZANTSEY's, but he is not quite as: fluent as KAZANTSEY. SOKOLOV's
English is favee fair, but he is decidedly behind KOVALEY and KAZANTSEY
in both grammar and fluency. Nevertheless, Subject feels SOKOLOV is good
enough to be in the same class as KOVALSV.
8. June
1530-1700 -- BEDRIN, CONCHARGEKIO, ROXAKENKO,
1700-1830 -- KOVALSV and SOKOLOV.

1530-1700 -- BEDRIN, CONCHARGEKO, ROXAKENKO.
1700-1830 -- KOVALSV and SOKOLOV.
15 June
1520-1700 - Subject arrived at the Embassy early. BEDRIN came into
the Reception Room about 1520 and took Subject to the classroom (in which
there has always been a TV set). Three of the guards were sitting around
the TV watching the Salazar fight when Subject and BEDRIN entered. CONCHAGENKO

came in about 1530 and ROHANZHENKO about 1540. All watched the fight
until it ended about 1550, after which the class began.
1700-1830 -- KOVALEV and SOKOLOY.
20 June
1530-1700 -- BERRIN, CONCHAREKKO, ROHANZHENKO:
1700-1800 -- KAZANTSEV. KAZANTSEV began talking about his trip on
his own initiative. He said he loft Mexico City on 30 May and arrived in
Noscow on 3 June. (He did not say when he returned to Mexico.) He gave no
reason for the trip, but said he had "several conferences and meetings" in
Moscow. Subject interjected that the thought the trip might have had something
to do with the Middle East crisis, since it broke out just about the time
KAZANTSEV left. KAZANTSEV laughed spontaneously at this idea and replied
that what he know about the Middle East wouldn't do anyone any good. He
then went on to say he-had spent his first weekend in Moscow with his son,
who shortly thereafter left for his summer job in "Siberia." He said he
spent the second weekend (10-11 Juno) with his daughter. The daughter,
according to KAZANTSEV, had planned to go "south" for a 2-3 week vacation in
early June, but postponed the vacation when she learned her father was
coming. (The implication, according to Subject, was that KAZANTSEV's trip
came about fairly suddenly.) What KAZANTSEV was most interested in talking
about, however, was the fact he had unexpectedly had had to take his English
proficiency test in Moscow. He consequently set aside the last three days
of-his stay for the test, which can often take that long. The first day
is taken up by an oral test, and if one passes that, he goes on. to the written
test, which can take up to two days. KAZANTSEV, however, did so well on
the oral test that he was exomated from the written test. He said his
exminers gave him a "4" (on a 1-5 scale) and would have given him a "5".
except for the fact he hadn't read any books in English since his last
test. One is supposed to read four or five books a year in English, according


6
to KAZUNTSBY. In any event, KAZUNTSBY was very happy with the outtome
and with Subject's work in preparing him for the test. In fact, he, said
that although he had originally started taking lessons from Subject only
to prepare for the test, he was so satisfied with his progress that he
intended to stay on with Subject despite the fact the test was behind him.
1530-1930 - KOVALSV and SOKOLOV.
22 June
1530-1700 - KAZUNTSBY took the first hour and a half. He merely
said BERN, CONCHARGNO, and ROKANGESKO would not attend class that day.
1700-1530 -- KOVALSV and SOKOLIN.
3. KOKOLV and SOKOLV. SOKOLOV is the moreOCRistico of the two.
While KOVALSV can be very pleasant, he sees to have an antagonistic
strain and occasionally challenges Subject's teaching with "that isn't
the way we do it in our courbes," etc. Sometimes, in fact, the disputes
on methods, points of grammar, etc. have become rather heated. On these
occasions, SOKOLOV has usually stopped in more or less on Subject's side
and cooled things off. At their second meeting, KOVALSV asked Subject directly
what his views were on the Middle East crisis, Subject turned the question
book on KOVALSV by saying he would frankly be more interested in KOVALSY's
ideas, as he was sure KOVALSV was much better informed about the situation
than he. KOVALSV backed away this time, claiming he didn't have much infor-
mation either, but at a later class both he and SOKOLOV parroted the Soviet
line about the crisis-Irael was the aggressor, etc. On another occasion
when the Middle East was again the topic, Subject referred to (what he recalled
as) President Truman's post-World Val II proposal to internationalize both
the Sues and Panama canals. KOVALSV immediately objected to this idea,
although he gave no indication of ever having thought about it before.

4. KOVELY. Subject said he mentioned KOVALVE and SOKCLOV to his
wife, and she immediately recalled KOVALVE is one of her students at the
Institute. that he had been friendly with a number of people at the
Institute (studenta and teachers). Cho of these, she recalled, was Bill
CASTELAZO, a U.S. citizen who then and still teaches Srlish and Spanish
at the Instituto. CASTELAZO is about 35. No 11.20-25 persons
who 7 or 8 years ago studied Russian at the Institute when it was taught
for a brief time by a Russian woman. 19745 Subject's wife told Subject
that KOVALVE and CASTELAZO had been very friendly and that KOVALVE had
invited him to the Soviet Embassy at least twice. CASTELAZO told Subject's
wife that after one of his visits to the Soviet Embassy, he was approached
by someone from the American Embassy and asked to inform on the Soviets.
CASTELAZO said he was repelled by the idea of being a n informer and
implied that he hadn't cooperated with the American. Subject said ho had
not known about CASTELAZO's acquaintance with KOVALVE, but had known that
CASTELAZO had studied Russian and had had him to his apartment along with
ROMANCEIRO, BERNIN, and CONCHURNEKO for his 1 July 1966 Batenzo Dominson
Day party.
5. Subject subsequently mentioned to KOVALVE that his wife remembered
having him as a student during his previous tour, Subject also remarked
that his wife had mentioned that KOVALVE and his (Subject's) friend CASTELAZO
had been friends. KOVALVE replied without any embarrassment that he didn't
remember Subject's info, but did remember CASTELAZO. KOVALVE asked Subject
to give CASTELAZO his regards the next time he saw him.
6. Other than a 1960 reference to "Guillermo CASTELAZO" as a 20-33
year old teacher at the Mexican-North American Institute and an author
of one of the Institute's text books, there are no Station traces on

sporta
for about 15 minutes. LOCIINOY said skiing and speed stichting were
two of his favorite sports, and thnt his greatest. sporting interest in
Nexico was playing tennis. Subject said that LOGIOVOY seemed to be an
avid sportaman. LOCIINOY said that he was going to Noscow on vacation toward
the end of July. No reference was made to Subject teaching LOCIINOY's son
English when the LOCIINOVS return from vocation, but Subject assunes this
is still LOCIINOY's wish.
S. Subject to Resectivatives Nake Tance At Dianeya, Prior to Glass. At
one of their classes after KAZANISSEVI's return from Noscow, Subject and
KAZIINSEVI discussed Subject's making tapes for use in connection with his
three Dignassy classes. It was agreed that Subject would come to the Embassy
half an hour or so early once a week to make the tapes. He was to begin
on 27 June (the day of our meeting). Subject did not yet know where he
was to do the recording, whether he would be left alone, etc.
9. Subject said he was considering having another Dominion Day Party of
on 1 July to which he would invite his Soviet students. I encouraged the
ide: and told him I'd pick up the tab.
10. The week of 19 June the wife of President DIAZ Crden called the
Director of the Institute Irlandes and asked if he could recommend a tutor
for a nephew of hers. The director replied that the Instituto had a good
English teacher and that although he was very busy, he would ask him if he
would be willing to take on the nephew. The director communicated the above
to Subject, and Subject gave the Director a list of the few hours he had
free. The director told Subject he would call Mrs. DIAZ Crden back and
would informa Subject if any of the hours were suitable. As of 27 June,
Subject hadn't hoard further from the Director.

MEMO OF CONVERSATION
Leila BELAVAL, Visa Officer of U. S., Embassy
1. I talked to Leila today about her contact with the Soviet who brought
BAZAROV's passport in for a visa yesterday. She Ident filed the Soviet from
a photograph as Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV, and said that he is always
the one who comes to the U. S., Embassy for visas, She did not recognize
the photograph of Vladislav Sergeyevich KORMUSIKIN, the Vice Consul.
Actually, Leila believed that LOGINOV was a Vice Consul, said she always
asks for him as such when she has to call the Soviet Embassy.
A 2. Apparently yesterday was not the first time that LOGINOV has tried
to make a date with Leila. She says that he always asks her what she does
in her free time, and that she has put him off by saying that she is very busy.
Once shekex he asked her whether she spent her free time with other people
ax from the Embassy and was surprised to hear that she usually spends her
off hours with non-Embassy friends. Yesterday LOGINOV again asked her
society. He said he was a very good candidate for his father. He
because she has started taking guitar lessons, 'He mentioned some Soviet
dance group that was coming to Mexico in a month or so and said he would
like to invite her to go to see them with him. He also told her he was not
married, Leila said she did not refuse the invitation outright but said that
she did not know whether she would be free when they came or not.
3. I told Leila a few of the facts of Sow let life: that all Soviets have to
be married in order to go overseas, that LOGINOV is a KGB officer and
was obviously trying to get his foot in the door of the U. S. Embassy through
her, that he was undoubtedly disappointed to hear that she did not spend
all her free time with other Embassy people, etc. Leila has evidently been
unsure about how to: react to LOGINOV's advances, has not wanted to be
rude to him, and seemed relieved when I suggested that she simply decline
his Invitations by always being busy. She says she does not like his slick
manner at all, and I gather that she has felt uneasy in having to deal with
him, but now that someone has told her how to react she will have no problem,
4. Lelia mentioned that LOGINOV knows English but is reluctant to
use it. He once read off the visa stamped in a passport in perfect English,
and he also read a copy of the new visa regulations in English (to himself,
but evidently understanding it all). According to the new regulations,
Sovlets no longer need visas for continuous transit of the U. S. (i.e., on the
same flight), but LOGINOV insisted on getting a visa for BAZAROV in spite
of this. (This is confirmed in LIENVOY.)

DATE OF MEETING:
15 June 1967
1. I met with Subject at the Del Pánco from 0800 to 1000.
The next meeting is for 18 July at 0830 at the same place.
3. On 8 June LOGINOV dropped by Subject's office to leave
two tickets for the Bolahoy Baliet performance on 11 June.
Subject invited LOGINOV and his wife for dinner and LOGINOV
and his wife 13 June, (COMBENT: LENTOY reports their confirming
this date on 13 June). Subject said the tickete were used by
his wife and son.
3. The guests on 13 June vere LOGINOV and wife, William do
Mier (P-5552), manager of KLI in Mexico and Gustavo. ORTIZ Hernan
(P-10971), ORTIZ was Mexico's first Ambassador to 'Israel and is
not a 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the
Service. His last job was Ambassador to Chile. He is 57 years
old and apparently a good friend of Subject's. Subject invited
ORTIZ because he knew that LOOINOV has been interested in public
opinion in Mexico about the recent Israel-Arab var. Subject had
been the most important role in the United Kingdom. He was
he wanted LOOINOV to talk to a real Mexican, The dock was slightly
leaded since Subject knew that ORTIZ is an Israeli partisan.
Subject purposely avoided the subject but it was not long before
the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100%
of
LOGINOV answered with a banality about the US8R only wanting peace.
ORTIZ then unloaded on LOOINOV for about half an hour. He told
him that he had been in Israel as ambassador and had seen both-
the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the
help the miserable and diseased Arabs with modicino, hospitals,
job training, agricultural aid, etc? This is what they need,
not tanks and jets. The Soviets are the real aggressora by
arasing the Araba and egging them on. And what fools the Sove
and the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of
the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of
such less sophisticated stuff. Soviet hypocrisy is obvious to
everybody. FEDORENDO's performance at the UN was shanaful, to.
LOGINOV never answered a word. Subject later reported the above
to the Israeli Ambassador who was pleased since ORTIZ is not a
80V and he is sure the above would be reported to Moscow.
The 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 23 July for vacation in
the US8R. Subject saw Mrs. LOGINOV and the 100% of the 100% of the
her Spanish is extremely limited, she did not participate in
general conversation. However, she handled herself voll and did
not seem in the least ill at esse. In a side conversation she
told Subject that they have a fifteen year old daughter who is
living with the other. He said that she has known LOGINOV
since the age of six as neighbor in Moscow. Finally, she said
that he is a chemical engineer in Moscow. Finally, she said
that
5. I asked if Subject had talked to Miriam AVILA Kats (P-381)
again about her contacts with our Embassy. He said he hadn't
I asked what advice he had given her. He said that he had told
her to be truthful with the Americans and to be careful with
LOGINOV.

On the 9 May I went with my wife to the reception given by the
ambarandor of Checoslovaguia on the occasion of hitier National Day.
The party took place in the garden where there were a couple of
1A JUDY
tables senting about ten persons each. Most of the people seating
at the tables were from embassies behind the Iron curtain, or
local supporters of the extreme left such as Cordero Amador, the
pintner Marin-Buesqued, the art critic Margarita Nelken, Ruth Rivera
etc. The Soviets were there headed by Bazarov and
Hors
Kazanteev, present. also by the name of/Tchnikov, Valentin Loguinov,
Tchnikov is a young man, about thirty five, speakx very good
Spanish and has a rather nice wife. He invitedus to attend the
exhibition of a film, a ruesian film at the embassy the next
day, he also whahe were leaving said that we had to go to his
house soon and have a real rusien dinner. This kind of invitation
is most unusual. I do not remember any other sovietico suggesting
such a thing.
In the party there were the usual diplomatic crowd which
a' ends parties of representations behind the Iron Curtain, Max
Wery, the Belgin ambassador and his wife, the French ambassador
and his wife, the French Counsellor la Tour du Pin and his wife,
the architect Lopez Malo who is one of the directors of the
Comité Organizador de los Juegos Olimpicos, the italian embaseador
and one of his daughters, the Urjukayan ambassador, the Chilean
- 1630
ambassador and Enrique Cobo del Campo the counsellor of the same
or
embassy, the cuban ambassador Joaquin Hernández Armas with whom
we talked about Venezuela and told me that it was an stupid thing
to accuse a country of trying to invade another country with half
a dozen men. The chechs had plenty of beer brought checoslova-

quia but mixed it with just as much mexican beer if you were not
careful. The Branciflian ambnessador was there, Guillermo Gimenes
Ramirez the ch-rgd of Costa Rica, Gonzalo Alcieda Urrutia, the
ambassador from Ecuador, from the "oreign Office, Muioz Zapata and
Plores Tejada. I do not remember seeing anybody from the US, but
I arrived somewhat late, Kai Sornerto the ambasesador from Finland
was present and so was the mayor general Natahn Aferi from Ghana,
the ambassador was most friendly as well as Jan Han the commercial
counsellor and Jiri Swestka the second secretary in
charge o the consulat.
Next day we went to the Soviet embassy for the exhibition of
a fii whose title I think was the Father of the Soldier, a rather
childish film but that brought tears to the eyes of some of the
embassy wives who attended. There was an small group of people,
including tonsre army officers from the Secretary de la Defensa,
and
miral Aznar Cetina, subsecretario de marina, and amiral
Otal Briceño, who after a long illness has now some new post in
Marina. All the Soviet staff was present, there were two or three
cuban including Curvello. There was a change, the door5of the
embassy were wide open and there was no question by the people
at the 12msm outside door, inside Frygov and 'bther fellow received
the visitors. There was as usual plenty ofwakv vodka, 1xxKmm small
eats but no caver, both thing were served before and after the
exhibition of the fithn film.
On the 17th of may we went to a reception for the National day
of Noruega. They have a beautiful house in Monte Cárpatoe which
had been built for the embassy along their norwegian style; the
new ambassador is a tall gaunt, strange man, there were not many
people because there was a diplomatic lunch at Relaciones and

No Greek: either. Chacha Valdes, formerly de Lanz Duret, with
her new husband, licenciado Lozano. She if the owner of Universal.
He was nobody until he married, now he is a well known jurist.
Francisco Agdera Cenarro, the director of Revista Internacional,
trying to impress the'rench ambesaador with the fact that he
had printed an editorial on Israel if his mazazine. Revista
Internacional has a of about fivehundred copies, but
gives Gúdera a good ten thousand pesos a month.
I was a fairly good party as far as di!lomatic pr ties
go,but sterile in results. Nobody appeared to
verv much about the war in the East, and some'epale'like the
Paraguany and the Tobias Eguizabal had the idea that everything
had been prepared in advance by the United States and the URSS.
That there had been a meeting in which the question had been
assembled.
Loguinov called me to the office to tell me he had tickets
for me and my wife for the Bolehoi ballet for Sunday night. We
had been unable to secure anything at the office.

On Sunday 11 June, Valentin Loruinov was able to obtain for us
two good ticketa for the Ballot Bolehoi at Bellas Artes and
afterwards we went to have something to eat at Lady Baltimore in
Madero Street. Very few people were there, which is not surprising
in view of the bad quality of their food and poor service. But
it was the nearest spot for a quick bite.
Loguinov was very much interested in knowing what my US
frienda thought about the situation in the Middle East end what
they would do about it. He was ineistent about the possible help
that the US would give to Israel, he said that the US had already
given Israel a considerable amount of ammunition and planes, and
specially money, the URSS had to give some help to the areas in
view of the help given to Israel. According to him there was not
the clighest doubt that Israel had been the agresor. The URSS
would never consent to any territorial gains by Israel.
During our conversation about food, specially about seafood
he let it be know/that he had been in Mazatlan several times.
He said that everything which had taken place in the Middle
East had been plotted in advance by the US and Ierael.

DATE OF MEETING:
3 June 1987
1. After a long hiatus, I called Subject on ca 14 May and
learned he was out of the country. I.called him again on 6 June
and we made a date for 8 June. The meeting was in the breakfast
room of the Del Passe Hotel from 0810 to 0915. The next meeting
is at the same place at 0830 on 15 June.
2. Subject was all excited about the Iraael/Arab conflict
and we spent the best part of the meeting discussing it.
3. He said that LOGINOV called him on 5 June and pressed
for a luncheon date the same day. Subject put him off until 8 June.
LOGINOV wanted news on the local Jewish reaction, was everybody
behind the Jews, was money being contributed, etc. Subject who
was madder than hell about Soviet support of the Arabs gave him
hell and to direct questions got the admissions from LOGINOV
that the Iraaliss were acting in golf-defense and that the
Americans and British were not providing the Irsaells air cover.
JOHNOV mentioned that he would go to the USCR on home leaves in
the country.
4. On 6 June Mirian AVILA Kata, who is also very excited
about the war and who told Subject that she had gone to the
Israeli Embassy to volunteer to serve in Iraael, told Subject
that when she returned home on the evening of 5 June, LOGINOV
was waiting for her on the street. His purpose was the same as
wanting to see the other, to pump her on local reactions to the war.
She was LOGINOV.
5. She then told Subject that in Holy Week she had been
called to the American Embassy and had been asked about her contact
with LOGINOV. She said that she had seen the same American
(no name given) about two weeks ago. She then told Subject that
the U.S. Senate, he was a leader, that to Introduces him to "one of her progressive
friends" or "someone in the U.S. Senate, he was a regular for the
favor of issuing a visa to Dr. Yuriy KUTLER.
6. The above is a capsule account of her relationship with
LEWENDRIIS. I played innocent until I got the whole time, he said, "if it
was, I got to be the same as the other, and he asked, "if it
wasn't you, who?" I told him that AVILA had notiades that Subject
was in contact with us and had in fact worried that her activities
(future) might hurt him which she was definitely against.
7. It appears that AVILA told Subject about us because of
LOGINOV's appearance on 5 June and her emotional state about the
war. I will discuss this further with Subject at the next meeting,
particularly what advice he has or will give her about cooperating
with us.

b. CHRYHIDY and LOQINOV
(P-6235)
(P-11712)
-
1). On 30 Hay CHRYHIDY and LOQINOV arrived at
BESABER's plant at about 1400. L was driving a brownish Chevy
Impels, 34-D.A. L was interested in seeing the house that BEASIER
had located for the Soviets. He said they wanted a house for
three, possibly four months (starting 1 June) and could easily
spend up to 85,000 HM per month.
2). BEABER could not leave the plant, but put them
in touch with the Pra. LARA who took them around to seven houses,
one of which the house is very returned to BEASIER's plant at
about 1700, sat around for about an hour, leaving because they
said the couriers were coming in that night and they had a lot
of work to do. (Couriers did arrive that night).
3). CHRYHIDY drank heavily (scotch) but did not
show any effect; LOGINOV didn't oven finish one Scotch and water.

a few days to sign the lease on the house and would look BEASIER
up. BEASIER told L that he had a friend with a tennis court and
in a few weeks when the friend returned to Mexico he (BESABER) would
arrange a day of tennis.
5). L did most of the talking although C was pleasant,
told a number of good jokes (in poor Spanish) and generally impressed
DEASIER as being pleasant type, not "pesado," as he assesses L.
c. Re COIGNE's request and as a follow-up to LIKAYAK/2's
report of 28 April 1967 re Lorenzo CARDERAS (P-5409), I asked
BEASIER if he knew of a house of prostitution at Dr. Manusi
Ugarto 1C3 A. He did not, but will check it out through the
doornen of several hotels.

thoughts in the seven weeks since she had agreed to cooperate,
but it proved unfounded. She this time was relaxed from the
start, was very friendly, and seemed to onjoy the opportunity
to get out. (She later told me in her apartment that she didn't
go out much, liked to spend her evenings at home reading,
listening to records, tending to her dwarf trees, etc.) She
made it clear from the start that she hadn't changed her mind
by warning me half-seriously and half-nlayfully that I shouldn't
think I could "buy" her with gifts. "You've bought me up here,"
she said, tapping her head with her forefinger. "That's
the only way you'11 get anywhere with me. " Most of the evening
was spent in general and (especially back at her apartment)
increasingly fuzzy discussion of Israel, the Jews, her job,
the Russians "as people," her very humanistic philosophy about
1: c, and I don't exactly remember what else. She is definitely
a smart girl, but I think less profound and sophisticated than
she tries to appear. Otherwise, she seems to be a very sincere
person, and she has given me no reason to doubt or suspect
anything she has told me.
3. Contact with LOGTVO, Subject said she hadn't been
out with LOGINV since our last meeting and had had only one
face-to-face contact with him. She said this was a little
over a month ago (early April) and was occasioned by for
efforts to help a client by the name of Dr. Yury
get
a Soviet visa. She said NITTLER is & dentist and definitely
a Communist sympathizer, if not a Communist. (XUTTLER has
F-711e 1573.) KUTTLER evidently thought he was liked by the
i


22
Rusians in return, as ho initially told Subject he was expecting
an official Soviet invitation to visit the USSR. As it turned
out, however, he had a nacd time even getting a Soviet visa.
Subject finally called LOGINOV herself to try to push things
along, but LOGINOV showed no willingness to facilitate things.
(LIENVOY has Subject on the phone to LOGINOV on 5 April.
After discussing KUTTLER's case, Subject remarked to LOGINOV
that she understod that "you (ustedes) must have some reason
not to want to give him (KUTTLER) the visa." LOGINOV replied
that there were "reasons enough.")
4. A day or two after her telephone conversation with LOGINOV,
Subject said she went over to the Soviet Embassy personally to
see if she could get anywhere with LOGINOV. LOGINOV received
her cordially, and for the first time asked her into his
office (she said it was the first office off the outside
Reception Room). She again asked LOGINOV to try to
speed up the granting of KUTTLER's visa. LOGINOV hermed and
hawed, indicating that he wasn't even sure the visa would be
granted. He finally told Subject that look, he had gone to
KUTTLER for dental work once, and KUTTLER had charged him much
too much. Consequently, he said, he wasn't going to give him
a visa. Subject said she could not tell if the destist bill
was the real reason for LOGINOV's negative attitude, but when
she persisted, LOGINOV finally relented and the following
exchange ensued:

LOGINOV: "All ritht, Miriam, I'111 do it for you (i.e.,
give NUTTLEA the visa). But you know, a favor
must be repaid by a favor."
Subject: "All right in that case, let me in the name
of the company invite you to dinner."
LOGINOV: "No, Miriam, I don't mean that."
LOGINOV then went on to say that as he had mentioned to her
before, he would like her to introduce him to "someone who
would be sympathetic to us" (i.e., to the Soviets). LOGINOV
emphasized that he realized Subject might not agree with this
"someone's" ideas, but stated that he knew Subject was the
type of person who "had respect for other people's views."
Subject said that she replied in a casual, almost flinpant
manner that "well, sure, if she met such a person, she'd
introduce them." With this the subject was dropped and Subject
left.
5. LICOZY-5. Subject on her own initiative began telling
me what a terrific guy her boss is. He according to her, has
one of the most winning personalities of anyone she has ever
met. At the same time he is extremely intelligent and shrewd.
"If he can't get what he wants through charm, he does it by
pure shrewdness." This is why he is such a successful businessman.
In reply to a question about LICOZY-5's background, Subject
said he had been born in Toland, was imprisoned by either the
Toles or Germans just before or during World War II (she was
rather vague on this point, and I confined myself to listening),
somehow got out and joined the Russians, taking part in the
Soviet invasion of Germany, Somehow he had survived all this,
made his way to Mexico, where he arrived penniless, and now


24
must have a small fortune in the bank. He vividly remembers
his former hardships, however, is a very generous and humane
person, and every year sends clothes to people in Poland and
Russia. He also has a very strong feeling for Israel. Obviously
he couldn't have survived a life like this if he weren't shrewd.
He has no love for the Russians, but was not above joining them
to easure his own survival in World War II and can be agreeable
enough toward them to retain their travel business. Subject
gave absolutely no indication that she had said anything to.
LICOZY-5 about me.
6. The conversation was the most relaxed as well as the
fursiest back at Subject's apartment, where we finished a bottle
of vodka LOGINOV had-given LICOZY-5 and LICOZY-5 had given her.
Back on the subject of LOOITOV, Subject said she "supposed"
he had tried to cultivate a lot of girls like herself. "hadn't
her?1" (I had told Subject at our last meeting that young women
were among LOOINOV's favorite targets, but hadn't been able to
tell what effect this "revolution" had on her. Now it appeared
that it had hit home and that it had wounded her pride to
think he not only had had ulterlor motives in dating her, but
had dated other girls the same way. I didn't reply directly,
but said something about LOOINOV being as smooth as they come.
Subject wasn't satisfied with this, however, and pressed me:
"He has tried the same thing with other girls, hasn't he?"
"Yes, Miriam, several, "I finally said. This seemed to satisfy
her.
7. Shortly thereafter, I asked Subject if LOOINOV were

the matter further when Subject (not to be left out of a good

LOGINOV As previously reported, Subject has seen
LOGINOV on numerous occasions on the Embassy grounds and in
the first office off the Reception Room. They usually exchange
greetings in English. On 30 March, LOGINOV come up to Subject
in the Reception Room and said that he'd like to spark to
Subject about English lessons for his 8-year-old son. Subject
said fine, and it was agreed Subject would drop into LOGINOV's
office (i.e., off the Reception Room) when he was through

about 1830, however, LOGINOV was just getting ready to leave
and it was agreed they'd try to ret together another time.
They finally did so on 11 April. Subject went to LOGINOV's
office about 1830 and stayed 15 or 20 minutes. LOGINOV in
a very relaxed and casual manner, explained that he had an
8 year old son whom he wanted to learn English. He said the
boy knew no English and very little Spanish. He stated that
they were going to Moscow on vacation in July and would be
back in August, and he consequently didn't want to begin the

lessions until they returned, but he wanted to tentatively
explore the matter with Subject now. lie sttned--in English-
that he would like Subject "to go to teach" the boy, the
implication being, according to Subject, that the lessons
were to be given at LOGINOV's home. If Subject couldn't
give the boy lessons when it came time, LOGINOV said he hoped
Subject would be able to recommend someone else. Subject said
he'd be happy to teach the boy if he had time, but that it was
of course too early to know whe'her he would be able to fit
him into his schedule in August. LOGINOV said he understood
and they could talk in specifics in August. LOGINOV added
only that he planed to pick up a special text (or set of
texts) for. teaching children English when he was in. Fioscow.
5. Subject said that LOGINOV had a pile of perhaps 70-75
passports on his desk on 11 April. Subject conmented on
LOGINOV's apparently heavy work load, and LOGINOV rellied
casualty: "Well, you know there are a lot of people who want
to visit the Soviet Union." He continued that most of the
passports on his desk were Mexican, but "several" were American.
He then began shuffling through the pile until he came to one
belonging to an American girl. He opened the passport to
her picture and showed it to Subject as an illustration.
Subject said he couldn't make out the name, but the nicture
was of a good-looking, blondish girl who appeared to be 23
or 24 years old. This was the only passport LOGINOV showed
Subject, and the top was thereupon dropped. At
the end of the conversation, LOGINOV stated that he certainly
would appreciate it if Subject could teach his son and he'd

get together again with subject in August.
6. I asked Subject if he thought he would have time to
teach the boy. Subject said it was impossible to tell, but he
could probably make time if we considered it irromtant enough.
I told Subject there was a good chance we would and in any
case not to give LOGIHOV a negative answer before consulting
me. I explained that LOOINOV was KGB and one of the most able
me' in the Embassy, and warned Subject to be on his toes in
his relations with him.
7. Subject conducted 11 classes at the Soviet Embassy
during the reporting period.

1700-1815 KAZANTSEV. BAZAROV and his wife were
suppos ed to have their first class from 1700-1830, but
KAZANTSEV said the Ambassador was too busy. No mention a
made of his wife. (The BAZAROVS1 classes are scheduled for
Tuedays and Fridays from 1700-1830. Classes for KAZANTSEV,
BEDRIN, GONCHARENKO, and ROMANCHENKO are scheduled for Tuesdays
and Thursdays.)
30 March
1545-1700 - BEDRIN, GONCHARENKO, ROMANCHENKO
1700-1800 -- KAZANTSEV. KAZANTSEV said that BAZAROV
expected to be tied up with the Soviet Petroleum Congress
delegation and probably would not be able to make his 1700-1830
class on Friday, the 51st. If not, KAZANTSEV said, GONCHARENKO
would use the time, since he was somewhat behind BFDRIN and
ROMANCHENKO.

CONTACT REPORT
SUBJECT:
Ernst COEBERL
DATE OF MEETING:
10 April 1967
1. I met Subject at his office from 1845 to 1915 on 10
April 1967. My purpose was to see if he knew Herbert Adolf
PELKA (P- ) Subject said that he didn't know either PELKA
or the two German witnesses to his marriage. However he does have
a friend; a secretary at Telefunken, where PELKA works. He will
check this girl and elicit information on PELKA.
2. Subject reported that he had noticed that Ralph WIGANDT
has been the most important and most important as a tennis partner
of LOGINOV. (COMMEENT: Per LIENVOY WIRGANDT and wife invited
LOGINOV to dinner. in March 1967). WIGANDT is a German who came
to Mexico after WW II. He formerly worked for Rieboldt Chemical
in Germany. His wife is from a well-known German-Mexican family
and a former president of the American Association of the American
from Stuttgart who recently EHC came to Mexico. WIEGANDT owns
ar has a controlling interest in Barnices Aislantes, S.A., located
at Avenida Toltecca 176. This company manufactures plastic foam
insulating materials. He lives in Cytopacca in a house which he
had a new company. He was a member of the American Association
describes as a pushy, ambitious businessman. The implication is
that he is unscrupulous and would do anything for a buck. Subject
doesn't know anything about his politics. Subject will obtain
more background information on him.

if we could arrange something else. Subject professed dismay
that the American Embassy even knew she existed, let alone that
she could possibly be of any help to the Enteasy. She than
became very defensive and only reluctantly agreed to meet me
for lunch at the Pergola Restaurant at 1100. The Fergola is
just a few blocks from her apartment.
3. Subject was waiting for me in front of the restaurant
when I arrived a couple of minutes before the hour. I found
a trin, stylishly dressed young woman with glasses and long,
dark hair pulled straight back from her forehead. The glasses,
exposed forehead, and hair style gave her a sophisticated look
which turned out to perfectly express her personality. She
did not at first strike we as particulariy attractive, but this
was probably because she was tensed up to the point that she
was pale. and expressionless and actually trembled slightly when
we first spoke. I later found her, especially when she took
off her glasses, to be quite attractive, and it is reasonable
to assume that LOOINOV is attracted by. more than her personality.
4. The first 15 minutes were tough going. Subject was
defensive to the point of hostility and totally unresponsive
to efforts to break through to her on a personal level. Fortunately,
she agreed to a drink before asking flatly what it was I wanted
I
replied directly but in a friendly manner that through routine
investigation, it had come to our attention that she had a
social relationship with Valentin LOOINOV. I continued that while
her personal life normally wouldn't be of any concern to the
American Sthassy, the fact was that the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City was a major base for espionage and subversion against both

Mexico and the United States and that LOOINOV was one of the
Soviets' cost able and active intelligence officers. One of the
areas where he was most active, I continued, was in establishing
relationships with young women like herself. For this purpose,
I said, he used various lines, alternatively telling girls be
was unmarried, divorced, or that His wife was in the Soviet
Union. (This brought the first expression of any kind from
Subject, who mailed faintly when I mentioned his using the
line that his wife was in the USSN. According to LICOZY-5,
this is what LOOINOV had told Subject.) Encouraged by the fact,
that Subject was at least listening, I went further into the
seriousness of the Soviet presence in Mexico, hitting hard the
fact that the Soviets tretened the security of both the U.S.
and Mexico, individually and collectively. When I finished,
I told Subject that I was tolling her all this both so that she
would know whom she was dealing with in LOOINOV and because I
frankly hoped that understanding the situation, she would be
willing to discuss LOOINOV with me.
5. To my disappointment, Subject reneled with undiminished
defensiveness that all right, she had gone out with LOOINOV a
few times. Because of her job as head of East European travel
at Mundos Tours, she had met and had to deal with LOOINOV on
visa matters. One day he had casually asked if she were free
that night and had invited her out. He had always been helpful
to her and she felt it was good business to accept the invitation.
In all, she had gone out with him "three or four times"-usually
to dinner, the movies, a coffee nightcap, and then "always

COPIES MADE
straight home." She admittedly enjoyed his company. She considered
herself "an intelligent person," and wouldn't go out with just
anybody. He too nad to be intelligent and had to be an enjoyable
companion. LOQINOV fit this' bill. He was "extremely intelligent,"
very considerate, an interesting conversationalist, completely
unlike the usual fill-mannered, boorish Soviet. But that's all
there was to their relationship, That's absolutely all there
was to it. They never discussed politics, and even if LOQINOV
wanted to do so, she'd refuse, because she had absolutely no
interest in politics. She had her own life to lead, and what
one side said made no more dent in her than what the other side
said. Reflecting for a moment on the above, Subject then added
almost disgustedly that when she began seeing DOGINOV she had
more or lessed expected that her name would wind up in the
American Embassy's files.
6. Subject said all of the above as though she were on the
stand and showed no intention of volunteering any more. I
consequently felt there was not much. more I could do with her
and that I had foreclosed any possibilities there might have
been with the wrong approach, whatever the right one may have
been. Moreover, at this moment, a well-dressed Texican who
looked to be in his early 30's came up to the table, gretted
Subject, and invited himself to sit down. Subject, apparently
as surprised as I, introduced him as Alejandro ALVAEZZ (no
Station traces) of ALVAAREZ AUTOPOTRIZ, a local firm which makes
springs for Volkswagen. Subject told me later that his father
owns the business. Alejandro, according to Subject, had once
been her professor in an accounting course at business school


49
COPIES MADE
here in Mexico City. Subject also said that Alejandro and his
firm were good: customers of Kundos Tours, and that Alejandro
had in fact just recently returned from a three week trip to
Germany. He spoke some English.
7. The appearance of ALVAREZ, who by now was ordering his
first of two martinis, seemed to end any remaining chances of
getting anywhere with the girl. As it worked out, however,
his appearance had just the opposite effect, because it provided
more than an hour of conversation on an. inoreasingly friendly
and personal level. By her second drink, Subject was even
managing a few laughs. Eventually we got onto the subject of
Israel, which, thanks to the information supplied by LICOZY-5,
I knew she had visited and had become romantically involved
with, she herself being half Jewish. I expressed considerable
interest in her trip and Israel in general, and she seemed
delighted to tell me about both. It then turned out that her
mother--who Subject said is a U.S. citizen--had lived in Moldavia,
had fold her daughter vivid stories of pogroms carried out by
the Russians against the Jews, and had fled Rumania before the
invading Russian (evidently during World War II.) The fact
that I had been in Humanie and Moldavia was good for another
ten minutes of conversation and seemed to impress Subject far
beyond its worth. In any event, by the time ALVAREZ left,
Subject and I were on a first name basis and she was telling me
how glad she was she had met me--all of which I attribute to
luck (ALVAREZ, who even quietly paid the check when leaving) and
dubonnet cocktails.

8. During the above conversation, we also discussed the
United-States, including President Kennedy, whom both Subject
and ALVAREZ claimed greatly to have adzired, and Subject's
experience in the U.S., where she attended Kent State University
in Ohio. She stated at this time that she regarded the U.S. as
a second home. She also expressed love for Mexico and together
with ADVAREZ, took pride in pointing to Mexico's progress.
9. Following ALVAREZ's departure, Subject looked at me as
though I were a bad dog or something and asked in a scolding
tone how I could have ever suspected her of cooperating with
LOGINOV. No, she just couldn't understand it. I replied that
I hadn't suspected her and reminded her that I hadn't said I
did. I then said more seriously that there was one thing tha t
bothered me, however. On the one hand, she told me she loved
Mexico and regarded the U.S. as her second country; yet on the
other, she claimed to be totally apolitical. The Soviets in
Mexico, I repeated, were working to undermine both countries,
and proceeded to go over again much of what I had said earlier.
I stated that it was incredible to me that Soviet activities in
Mexico didn't make any difference to her. I had contacted her,
I said, not because I had any suspicion of her, but because from
the little I knew of her I had hoped she'd cooperate in helping
us learn more about LOOINOV and his activities in Mexico. Subject
thereupon protested that there was nothing more she could tell
me, She had told me everything worth telling about their
association. Moreover, she hadn't seen him since, Christmas time.
LOOINOV was amart, never talked about anything sensitive, and
could probably never be induced to-do so. The only thing


140000
COPIES
he had ever asked her of an even remotely suspicious or
interesting nature was whether she had any friends at the
American Embassy. She said she had replied tartly that she had
friends everywhere, and that LOGINOV hadn't bothered her with
such questions since. In short, she didn't see how she could
be of any help. I relled that since it. was. I who need the help,
this was for me to decide, that whether she liked it or not she
was in contact with an important Soviet intelligence officer
who was of great interest to the United States, and that now
that I knew her better, I was confident she had the intelligence
and tudgnent to help us. I did not want to interfere in any
way in her personal life. Nor did I really want her to do anything
in the sense that she would have to go out of her way. All I
wanted was that she be as observant as possible during her
normal contacts and dates with LOGINOV, to try to see into the
man, what made him tick, what his problems were, whether he
was satisfied with his work, how he liked to relax, what did
he enjoy, what did he want, etc. Then after each substantial
contact, most probably a date, I'd like to have the opportunity
to sit down with over lunch or wherever it be and discusas
her observations. This was all I was asking. All right, if
that's all I wanted, she'd do it.
10. There was, I said, one thing I wanted to impress on
her: if we were to obtain any worthwhile results, one thing was
essential. Subject noided at this point and interrupted:
"I know. keep quiet." I emphasized that this meant with
everyone, including her family, her friends, her poss and her
co-workers, Subject assured me that she could be relied upon.

COPIES
11. Contact Arranarements. Subject-sgreed to call me to
set up a luncheon date after her next date with LOOINOV. We
will meet at the entrance to the Pergola at the time and date
specified. I gave her the 870 extension and asked that she use
the name "Mary" when calling.
12. There are clearly two essentials if Subject is to
develop into a worthwhile asset. First she is going to have to
come up with more interesting observations than simply that
LOGINOV is smart. She may be able to do this by.becoming a
more diligent and careful observer--which I think she is
capable of--or it may require an effort on her part to develop
a closer relationship with LOOINOV. One possibility in the
latter direction is to prevail upon her to become more intimate
with LOGINOV than she now appears to be. On the basis of
LICOZY-5's opinion that she probably sleeps around, this might
be possible, although it is much too early to say. Second,
Subject must prove cooperative. She strikes me as a very independent
and strong-willed person, and there is no guarantee she won't
change hermind or do only what she feels like doing.
It is also possible that in a moment of reconsideration, she
might confide in LICOZY-5, in which case her credibility would
become tangled with his.

CONTACT REPORT
SUBJECT:
BESABER
DATE OF BETTING:
7 March 1967
1. Operational: Net BESABER at his hotel room in Del Paseo
for breakfast. Neot lasted from 0800-0920. Next neet will be
after Kaster.
2. Substance
a. BREVKEP: BEWEK? phoned BESABER on Friday, 3 March 1967
to invite himself, his wife and the KAZAZINSKI couple down for
the day on 5 March. They arrived on 5 March at about100, stayed
until 1700.
b. BESABER reported that Mrs. RAZDZINSKA is three months
pregnast (by her admission) and that he, BESABER, thinks that
BEWEK? is the father. He cited the following as evidence :
(1) The RAZDZINSKIS admitted they they had been
married for over five years, yet this is her first pregnancy.
(2) Mr. RAZDZINSKI was totally unattentive to Mrs.
R. BESABER and his wife asaume that after so many years of
waiting for a child, Mr. R. should have shown more concern for
and interest in his wife.
(3) Likewise, Mr. R. was totally disinterested in
the fact that he is about to become a father.
(4) BEWEK? on the other hand, showed concern for
Mrs. R. when she went to sleep in the sun. Twice be suggested
that Mr. R. wake her up so she would not get burned. He didn't.
(5) Mrs. R. appeared interested in BEWEK? When he
want swimming Mrs. R. followed, proceeded to jump on him and
frolic in the water. Mrs. R. paid no attention at all.
(6) Mrs. R. sat next to BEWEK? at lunch (on purpose),
kept looking at BEWEK? lovingly.
(7) BEWEK? possibly embarrassed by all the attention
Mrs. R. was showing him, made come very complimentary remarks
about his wife. Mrs. BEWEK? who apparently was completely
oblivious to what BESABER and his wife thought was so obvious
in the BEWEK?/Mrs. R. relationship, was obviously very pleased

but surprised, to hear her husband speaking about her in such a
complimentary way. She asked incredulously whether he really meant
what he said and when BETWEENE reiterated with some embarrassment
that he thought she was the best wife in the world, Mrs. BEWEEK,
covered with confusion but happy said that this was the first
time he had ever said such kind things about:ther, the first
time she had been aware that he really did think she was a good
wife.
(8) BETWEENE seemed relaxed enough, but different. On
several occasions when political matters came up, usually raised
by Mr. R., he changed the subject, once asked Mr. R. almost rudely,
"Don't you have anything better than politics to talk about."
(9) Mrs. BEWEEK said that the two complex had been
in the habit of going off on weekends together. BESABER supposed
that BEWEEK may have done the deed during one of their outings.
G. In private conversation with BESABER, Mrs. BEWEEK
asked if BEBEBERhad heard from BEBETON. When BESABER said he had
not Mrs. BEWEEK said that her husband had told her BESTON was
in Colombia (BLINKARD had told BEWKEP this). She then went on
to say that DEBETON was the nicest man in the world. "I don't
know what he was the same as the bisect man in the world. "The
introduced us to another woman (obviously BLINKARD) whom we
see off to, but it's not that.
d. Mrs. BEWEEK, still alone with BESABER, was very
complimentary towards the U. S. She said the U. S. was made for
women, the merchandise, the packaging, the stores, etc. Moreover,
the people are all nice.
e. Joined by BEWEEK, Mrs. BEWEEK got off on the Russians,
She explained that it was difficult to understand the Russians
since she, as a Polo, belonging to the Western Cultural traditions,
and the British American War, was a very good thing to
apparently particularly thinking of the sense of distrust in the
Russian mentality. She said that the Russians here in the
Embassy simply could not believe that the two daughters of the
former Polish Ambassador, Jerzy GRUDZINSKI, had been permitted
to stay on in Mexico after their BEWKEY father's recall last year.

Mrs. HEWEEP told Mrs. BESABER that sho wis not
teaching geography at the Embassy to the children of the officials.
8. BEWEEP told BESABER that he thought he would remain
in Mexico until the first few months of 1989, but certainly until
after the Olympics of the fall of 1968.
h. Tenon RAZDZINSKI and wife - In addition to the
information above noted regarding R. and his wife, the BESABERS
picked up the following :
(1) RZADZINSKI was previously stationed in Vietnam as
a member of the ICC (interpreter). He speaks good English and
his Spanish, although not as good, is understandably.
(2) R. doesn't understand why the Americans are
carrying out the war they way they are. Without in any way,
criticizing the American position, he did say that he found it
unbelievable that they did not destroy the port of Haiphang.
(3) R. had contact with Americans in Vietnam. XH He
apent one month at the Danang air bass, apparently enjoyed it.
(4) R. did not get off on politics, possibly because
BEWEEP apparently did not want to talk about such subjects.
3. Comments
We have no information to substantiate the BESABERS
supposition that BEWEEP is the father of Mrs. R's expected child.
I told BEWEBER this. It may be true, but to have any operational
significance, up would almost have to prove it.
4. Plans
a. I asked BESABER to arrange a lunch with BEWEEP in
the near future to try to see if there was anything more to the
above supposition. (Lunch now set up for 4 April).
b. Tentatively, BEWEBER will invite LOGINOV to Cuernavaca
for 8 or 9 April to look at houses (for Sov Embassy retreat) and
play tennis at Colonel Higgins (whom I will brief as soon as
I can get hold of him).

B. Finances
1. Co picked up BESABER's accounting for revolving fund.
1'11 reiaburso him at next meet.
C. Substance
1. Soviets - At about 1000 on 18 February Vladimir Ivanovich
SHIPAKEVICH (P-8167) phoned BESABER from Cuornavaca. BESABER had
never met him before. 8 explained he friend of Valentin Sergeyevich
LOGINOV (P-11712), that L unable to make it because some people
were not concerned about the importance of the BESABER's
products, therefore BESABER asked him to come to factory. BES
arrived with wife and young girl who works in the Embassy (18-19
years old, tall, good figure; dark brown hair, spoke Spanish,
she wore kerchief) - this probably Tatyana MARKINA (P-12945).
3. 3 brought almost 3000 poses worth of stuff including two
large screens. BESABER opines that this was not personal
purchase, but rather either for the Embassy or operational expense
deal. 8 also insisted that purchases be delivered to Embassy,
not his house.
BESABER received BESABER and wife to Army Day reception at the
Boviet Embassy (28 Feb 1987), saying that he had forgotten to
bring written invitation but that it would like the gate of the
Embassy (BESABER was reluctant to go and I thought it better for
him to not appear overly eager so he did not go.)
4. Before leaving (they stayed about 45 minutes) 8 told
BESABER that he would probably come to Cuornavaca the following
day, Sunday about noon, (be didn't.)

5. After 8, 12X wire and N had loft BESEARCH picked up a
girl and drove to the Argema (phonetic) hotel in downtown
Cuenravaca. Sitting in the garden of the hotel at about 1300
he apotted S(with his shirt of) sitting at another table
conversing with a man who looked Russian, apparent age 25, this,
way dark brown hair. S's five also present, but M not. BEASABR
left after about 15 minutes without talking to S although 8 must
have seen him.
8. Per CO instructions BESAÉER honed L on 24 February to
apologize for not making 25 to the reception. During this
conversation (LIENVOY intercepted) L said he would come to
BESAÉER's house for lunch on Saturday, 25 February with about
five other people, He showed up at about 1545, stayed until 1830
today.
Aleksandr Mikhaylovich BROVKIN (P-829) and wife
Boris Alokandrovich MALAKBOVICH (P-9772) and wife
Mrs. Pavel YATSKOV (P-885)
Mrs. LOGINOV (P-11712)
8 assorted children of above.
7. They arrived in two cars, BROVKIN driving a 2-year old
light blue Ford Falcon, LOGINOV a blue-gray Chevrolet, license
plates 19-DA'. (BESAÉER may be color blind - our records show
both cars as being green.)
8. The conversation was characterized by a lot of
propaganda on BROYKIN's and LOGINOV's part. Although Vietnam was
not mentioned, L. boasted several times that the Soviets would
be made the moon first, complained about the Kennedy burned in
scandal, and generally spoke. As an anti-American vein, BEASABR
and his wife tried to laugh them out of this theme, but with little
success.
9. At one point BESAÉER mentioned an article he had recently
read in Business Week about the Soviet car industry. When he
told LOGINOV that the article purported to be based on CIA
information, L would not leave him alone until he found the
article and gave it to him.
10. LOGINOV was obviously the superior of the three men.
Neither MALAKBOVICH car his wife said a word. BROVKIN, after a
few times (but not drunk) started moaning about the problems
of life. He was a great part the only thing that kept him going was his
good wife and children. At this point LOVINOV walked up behind
BROVKIN' SARKESKXK chair, practically lifted BROVKIN, chair and all, and
said, "We must go."

11. An far as the BESABRE could make out the only purpose
of the visit (other than to got a free meal) was to invite the
BESABERs to come to the Embassy to see Soviet films. Not knowing
how he should react BESABER was non-committal, although he couldn't
resist asking BROVKIN if they had any Westerns in color. (I
told BESABER he should not go to movies and if the subject came
up again to tell the Sove that while he liked them as people,
he didn't want to hear every propaganda either orally or from the
sound. (I)
12. BESABER is less impressed by LOGINOV's intelligence than
heretofore. Between L's and B's heavy-handed propagandizing
(especially in the capitalistio "ambiente" of the BESABERS)
BESABER was less than impressed with their tact.
13. Mrs. BESABER reported that of the three women Mrs.
YATSKOV was by the far the most presentable. She learned that the
YATSKOV were on their second tour in Mexico, that they liked
Mexico (Mrs. BESABER is Mexican). Mrs. BROVKIN related that they
had one daughter (age 14) in Moscow besides the two children with
them in the world.
14. Plans for future got-togethers include only LOGINOV.
Mrs. BESABER will look for some housing for the Sove in Cuernavaca;
BESABER when she has found something, they'11 invite LOGINOV down
to have a look at them. There is also the possibility of tennis,
although both BESABERS are loathe to take any Soves to Mrs.
BESABER's tenants club, practically all the members of which are
Amortization.
15. The BESABER proposed and I second the motion that I
contact Laurence Higgins, a long-time Station contact and personal
friendof the BESABERs and tell them that the BESABERS are
cultivating Soves in our behalf, ask him to let BESABERS bring
LOGINOV, IN and possibly others to Higgin's court in Cuernavaca.
16. Attached are signatures of the Soves who visited BESABER.
17. Raul Morales Montreya - - 14. 32 Feb meet BESABER handed
over the attached postcard from RMM, dated 14 Feb from Colima.
At the 28 Feb meet BESABER reported that PAM had phoned him from
Colima on 24 Feb, reporting among other things that he would be in
Colima for another month or so. He said he was working in the
office of Secretaria Particular of the Governor of Colima (tol:
2-04-11) and staying at the Hotel Costeno (tel: 2-00-35).

On Saturday 28 I went to a party nt the house of the Greek
Conoul General Leander Vourvoulias, and I saw there Vladimir
Loguinov engaged in a hoated discussion with an emercina
hinn
conmil whose name is Sherry. Sherry was arguing that there were
A lot of Ohinshan an North Vist Nem, and Vayillinov whA
that it was a pity that such a big nation as the US should be
fighting an small and poor nation like Viet Nam.
I had a talk with Loguinov, who I think now is in charge
of consular affairs and he told me that he thought that nego-
cintions for the cultural agreement with Mexico were still
boys
going on; but that those/who had been awarded the rellowships
had already gone. But according to what he said there were
quite a few more then ten.
Loguinov was with his wife and talking about the Rolshoi
ballet he told me that I should have rang him up and he would
have taken us, me and my wife, to see the ballet and to see
the dancers behind the stage. He said that the ballet was
coming to Cunadd for the fair and probably would come again to
México.
The Ruseians will give a party for the consuls, film and
drinks sometime during February.
Loguinov asked me if I thought that some consula would not
show up at the Russian embesey as they did when they were invi-
ted by the Cubens. I told him that the position was entirely
different because most countries had diplomatic and consular
relations with the URRS.

recently rejoined RAY'S firm after previously leaving it and
working for another firm in Mexico City. (The man is undoubtedly
John G. PAGE, who is listed in the 1966-67 Anglo-American Directory
as Sales Manager for Tele-Revista, S.A. The 1961-62 Anglo lists
a John G. PAGE as being with Richard K. TOFTKINS y Assoc. -i.e.,
clearly the predecessor of "TOMKINS, RAY, MARTEL.") According
to Subject, Mrs. PAGE's mother is Dr. Anita BRUNNER, an American
and the editor of "Mexico This Month." Mr. PAGE looks to be
35-40 years old and his wife about 30. PAGE is half Jewish and
one of his parents was born in Russia. PAGE consequently speaks
some Russian and spoke a little with KUCHEROV. LIROBBIN-1 saw
RAY a few days after the film showing, and RAY mentioned that
PAGE had told him that ENCHIROV had made a definite effort to
make friends with him (PAGE), but that he (PAGE) had no interest
in making friends with Communists. CAL
4. As it turned out, Gulliver's Travels wasn't shown after
all, as the film turned out to be in very poor condition and kept
breaking when run on the projector. In its place, the Soviets
showed a Soviet film about a poor young woman in 19th or early
20th century Russia who marries a wealthy old man and is
corrupted by her new found riches. The kids and everyone else
were disappointed, but Subject found some consolation in the fact
that the flick at least was, clean.
5. 15 February. On this date Subject and LINORBIN-1 attended
an evening reception at the Indian Embassy at the invitation of
their friend K.D. FARASHAR, the Indian Consul. LOGINOV and
SOKOLOV were also there, both without wives. Subject at first

and unfortunately rally didn't know of any. LOGI'OV said that
he
probably really ought to take English lessons from a Britisher.
lic added that he had once taken a few lessons from a "girl from
Texas," but he had had to stop because of her "Texas accent."
LOGI'OV finally said that well, look, he was having " a little
party" the next evening and would like Subject and her husband
(whom he eventually met in the course of the evening) to attend,
as he would like to have her become acquainted with the Soviet
Imbassy, too (i.e., in addition to the Indian Embassy). LOGI'OV
added that perhaps she could even put something in TIE M'WS about
the affair, Subject accepted the invitation, although without
LIMORINI-1, who was about to leave for the States, and said he's
she'd see if she could get a photographer to the Embassy.
6. 15 February. On this date Subject attended the Consular
Corps gathering at the Soviet Embassy. She went with the
PARASHAS. LOGI'OV was the first Soviet to greet her, but
within a few moments PRIXHODKO and KUCITROV came hustling up.
Subject said that LOGI'OV seemed genuinely surprised that his
colleagues already knew her, but he did not ask for an explanation
of how. On their parts, FRITHODKO and KUCHEROV seemed equally
surprised, but also avoided asking any questions. In the course
of the evening, Subject talked with PRIXHODKO, KUCHEROV, DOIAOV,
Hrs. PRIXHODKO, and Mrs. SOYOLOV. LOGI'OV made no effort to
search her out, and she did not talk with him again until leaving,
at which time she thanked him for the invitation and apologized
that the M'WS photographer she had asked to come to the Embassy
had not shown up. However, she said she'd try to but
in "Around the Town."

gone and spend and/or make some time with her. She said she
actually felt sorry for KUCHIT ROV, because he Just wasn't cut
out for the role and she thought he probably drended it.
8. 23. February. On this date Subject attended the Soviet
Army Day reccention at the Soviet Embassy. She went with? earl
GONZALIZ and an American named Bill SOLELLENES, whom Pearl
brought along as her escort. (KUCHIT ROV left an Invitation for
Fearl with Subject on 17 February.) According to Subject,
SOLESPINE is about 35 and is in "publicity" work here. (According
to the A-A Directory, William A. SOLELME is an executive in
the International Department of Walter Thompson de Mexico.)
Subject did not notice any other Americans at the recention.
She talked with PRIKHOORV, Mrs. PRIKHOORV, KUCHIT ROV, DOLGOV,
and, briefly LOGINOV. DOLGOV said he had been with PRIVADA for
six years. Subject had put a blurb about the 16 February Consular
function in THE NEWS on 19 February and brought along a clipping
for LOGINOV. LOGINOV said he hadn't seem it, seemed pleased,
and thanked her. He then asked if she were going on the Consular
Corps tour of the Mexican Home Show. on 3 March. Well, no,
Subject replied, why would she be, she wasn't a consul or married
to one, and consequently hadn't been invited. LOGINOV relited
that he thought she should go and therefore he was making her
an honorary Soviet consul. Subject said that was fine with her
and she'd see him at the Home Show. (I told Subject on 28
February to be careful with LOGINOV, because he was an experienced
KGB officer and one of the most able men in the Soviet Embassy.
This seemed to delight as much as concern Subject.)

9. 3 March. Subject did not at first are LOITOV on the
Home Show tour, but mid-way through the tour she felt a tar on
her choulder, turned and sow LOOTOV. They then walked along
together for the last 25 minutes as or so of the tour. Subject
said that nothing of interest was said and they parted without
any specific mention of getting together again. Subject said
LOOTOV spent most of the time criticizing the U.S. on everything
from its foreign policy to its treatment of the American Indian.
10. Fearl GONZALEZ. Subject told me on 8 March that Pearl
had just received permission for from the Cuban. Government
to visit Cuba as a journalist. Subject said U.S. foreign
curcrespondents in Mexico had applied for permission to visit
Cuba many times in the past, but had all been turned down.
Pearl and Harold JONFS of the Copley News Service, according to
Subject, were the two most recent American applicants. JONES,
according to Subject, was turned down. Subject said also thought
Pearl was probably given permission because the Cubans believe
they can lead her a round by the hand and get some useful
publicity out of her. Subject noted that P earl believes
Castro has done a lot of good for Cuba and that he has been
unfairly treated by the U.S. press. Moreover, Subject observed,
Pearl is by no means a full-fledged or experienced newspaper
woman, as her only experience consists of writing society articles
in THE NEWS for the last year. Subject said F earl planned to
visit the American Embassy on 8 March in ord

from the State Department to make the trip.

CONTACT REPORT
SUBJECT:
LICOZY-5
DATE OF MEETING:
15 February 1967
1. I met and had breakfast with Subject at the Hotel
Del Paseo from 0900 to 0950 on 15 February 1967. The next
meeting is at the Del Paseo on 22 February at 0830.
2. Subject reported that after a hiatus of the contact
with the Soviet since the end of December, LOGO KYI called him
on 13 February 1967. The meeting was held at 14th. Subject
was busy on the 14th but agreed to meet him on the 15th at
the Cafe Escla, near Subject's place of work. Subject chose
a cafe rather than a restaurant in order to keep the meeting
brief. He assured me that, other than being pleasant, he
wouldn't accept any assignments or requests for information.
3. Subject said that the private dinner for influential
Jews to talk to ECHEVARRIA at Jacobo ZABLUDOWSKI's house
had a few times ago. Subject will check with ZABLUDOWSKI. He
said he also intends to get a courtesy call on ECHEVARRIA
soon since he is a very influential family may become president
and
it wouldn't harm Subject to keep his.
4. Subject heard from Pedro Ferriz, a partner of
ZABLUDOWSKI on TV, that USIA in Mexico had payed for the TV
transmission time of the recent KOSYGIN interview from London.
Asked why, Ferriz answered that USIA wanted the Mexican public
to know the Soviet position on Vietnam and China.
5. Subject reported that the Air France inaugural flight
to Red China had been cancelled due to the situation in China.
I told Subject that Headquarters had expressed no interest in
any case.
6. It asked Subject for the details on being representative
for LUEXINSIE, the Red Chinese equivalent of Intourist. He
said that in 1960 he attended the American Society of Travel
Agents convention in Honolulu. On the way back he took a tour
of the FE and NE with a group of travel agents. In Hong Kong
the Hong Kong Tourist Board had a cocktail party for them.
A representative of LUEXINSIE was at the party and invited the
group for lunch. A- this lunch he offered to make them agents
for his company. Everybody signed up since there was no contract
involved they were just appointed. Since then he has been on

their mailing list. He never has processed a traveller to
China. He thinks that Cooks is also an agent but is not sure.
7. Subject said ho is processing several people as
tourists to the USSR in the spring and summer. No viasa have
been issued yet. He promised me thornofax copies of all viasa.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Cocktail Party with Official
Bloc Representatives
1. At a party given by the local head of the Consular
Corp Association on 28 June/ the undersigned net and again
chatted with Valentin SNOIGINOV of the Soviet Embassy. He
also met for the first time- Jan Jakowiec of the Polish Embassy
who was introduced to undersigned by LOGINOV.
2. As usual LOGINOV spent most of the time conversing
with undersigned provocating him on a number of issues. The
undersigned answered, making a few similar comments about the
Chinese Civil War. When LOGINOV mentioned Vietnam, undersigned
was not the same. He was not the most important source of
bring peace to that area so they could concentrate more-on
the Chinese Communist danger. At one point in the conversation
undersigned jokingly asked LOGINOV if there were Soviet
nationals in North Vietnam. The latter said, "sure, we have
been the most important source of the United States. He was
meant was behind guns or in the seats of airplanes. LOGINOV
said absolutely not. It also seems that LOGINOV has been
keeping track of the people he sees undersigned talking with
the most important source of the United States. He was
know if undersigned has seen "his Haitian friend&." Undersigned
asked which one - the black one or the white one. LOGINOV
said the white one, referring to the Haitian Vice Consul whom
the President was the President of the United States. He was
seen the Haitian at the Haitian National Day about a month
ago but noted that the only Soviet present at that party was
ANDREYEV, not LOGINOV. The latter, incidentally, corners
the Haitian anytime begins with the U.S. to, although especially
the United States has been in a COIGNOV and was asked under-
signed when he would come play tennis with him (this is about
the fourth or fifth time). Undersigned told him he would do
so after he gets invited by LOGINOV as the latter has often
amended that he was the President of the United States. He
was the Protection Section of the Embassy. "Protection against
whom," he asked The undersigned gave him the usual lowdown:
on the number of tourists to Mexico and their problems.
LOGINOV must have been interested in the section as he mentioned
that a U. S. Vice-Consul working in that section whom he had
met recently will be transferring to another post.

3. JAKOWIEC appears to be a man who likes to talk. His
Spanish is quasi bi-lingual and JAKOWIEC says, by the way,
that he learned it in Brazil His wife is a plump, very
Polish-looking woman. Her initial conversation was to laugh
in the world. He was a man who was a man who
both Mr. and Mrs. JAKOWIEC appear to speak fluent Russian.
At one point in the conversation undersigned mentioned there
is hardly a. Pole in Poland who does not have a relative in
the world. He was a man who agreed and commented that while the
Poles are close to American American American House
pleased at other things that the U. S. does. Undersigned
deferred thes discussion of this point for another meeting.
As many of the Consular Corp members know that undersigned
that the world was a man who was a man who was a man who
not hide this fact to the official bloc representatives as
they would find out about it anyway. This came out for the
first time on the occasion of this cocktail party when
he was a man who was a man who was a man who was a
Polish members of the Armistice Commission there. The
undersigned, who has known a number of these people quite well,
told JAKOWIEC that they speak French better than Polish as
the French, which is a man who was a man who was a
Poland after Gomulka took power. When JAKOWIEC started to
imply that this indicated how wonderful things were in Poland,
undersigned pointed out that the parents of the returnees,
many of whom worked under very difficult conditions in France
in the coal mines, preferred the hard work to the chance of
working in the world.
The new cocktail party held by the Consular Assn.
will probably be held at the Soviet Embassy. The President
of the Association told undersigned that LOGINOV had asked him
for his agreement to hold the next party at his Embassy. A
large attendance of official bloc representatives can therefore
be expected at the next get-together.

Personality Assessment Questionnaire on Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV
201-285412)
1. Forwarded herewith is a Personality Assessment Questionnaire
on LOGINOV prepared by LIREALM-1 in February 1969.
2. By virtue of membership in the same club in which they are
both active participants in the same activity, LIREALM-1 has known
LOGINOV for a little over two years. In this club they have several
mutual contacts. As a result LIREALM-1 has met LOGINOV several times
at social activities in the homes of these contacts. Although LOGINOV
has never been a formal target for LIREALM-1, the relationship has
been close enough and of sufficient duration in LIREALM-1 to fill out
a meaningful Personality Assessment Questionnaire.

PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE
1. This is a new, experimental version of the Personality Assessment
Questionnaire (sometimes informally collied the PROQ III) which has been in
use for several years. This new form is largely a checklist and thus requires
far. less easy-type reporting than the previous form.
2. For a number of years, our operational psychologists have been de-
veloping a system for indirect assessment of target personalities. The
system employs-in lieu of psychological tests and interviews-observations
of appearance, manner, and style of behavior. Such factors are
introduced in the literature. The system is a key test items, are
weighted and analyzed to yield a personality profile. Working from the
profile, operational psychologists describe the target personality's basic
aptitudes, attitudes, motives and susceptibilities. The goal of the assess-
ment is to identify feasible means of influencing the target person.
3. Reliability is vastly increased when two or more observers complete
this questionnaire independently. All items need not be completed; in fact,
it is a rare case, where contact is sufficient to complete it fully. You are
encouraged to guess where complete information is lacking. Mark such
questions are given to the "X" instead of the customer check mark or "X". Thus,
observer with very limited contact can be expected to enter more 'Go'.
than "X's."

9.03
Overall impression of eating and smoking behavior. (Check the
most appropriate description.)
9.03.01
A' hearty eater with well-defined preferences. He eats and smokes
with considerable guest but tends to be a little on the coarse and
boorish side. It is rather easy to imagine him eating huge sand-
wiches and drinking beer with the boys at the neighborhood bar.
9.03.02
A heavy eater with limited preferences. He eats and smokes
with gusto but his manners are definitely coarse and boorish.
It is rather easy to imagine him becoming quite sharp with a
waiter who serves him unfamiliar food or a dish prepared in
an unfamiliar way.
9.03.03
A sensual eater who knows all the restaurants and their native
specialties. He is very anxious to have others try dishes he
has discovered. He eats with obvious pleasure, savors his
smokes, and though rarely gauche, he is more aware of his
food than his manners. It is easy to imagine him cooking and
serving special dishes to his friends.
-24-


140000

9.03.04
A sensual eater who tends to eat by himself when possible.
He seems to eat all types of food and has something of the
air-of-a-gluten about him. He eats with obvious pleasure,
savors his smokes and afterwards will finger alone at a table
with self-satisfaction: It is easy to imagine him hovering
alone over the buffet at a cocktail party savoring the tidbits.
9.03.05
A conventional eater who usually goes along with the crowd.
He probabl' has food allergies that prevent him from eating
certain foods. He gives the impression. of enjoying smoking
more than eating but his table manners are adapted to what-
ever situation he is in. It is easy to imagine him taking an
indigestion pill in the privacy of his room.
9.03.06
A conventional eater who always goes along with the crowd.
He eats with little relish and rarely mentions anything about
his likes or dislikes. He smokes at every opportunity, but.
more mechanically than with pleasure. He usually tries to
adept his manners to the situation but may be a little awkward
and obvious in doing so. It is easy to imagine him grabbing a
bite at a sidewalk stand at any time of day.
9.03.07
A gourmet eater who has marked and varied sophisticated
food tastes. Dining is quite a ritual with him, and atmo-
sphere and service are almost as important as the food. He
is graceful and cultured at table and smokes in the same
manner. It is easy to imagine him dressing for dinner, en-
joying fine wines and food by candlelight.
9.03.08
An unconventional eater, a man who "eats like a bird."
He eets in a preoccupied way, obviously indifferent to
his food and surroundings. It would not be surprising to
learn he was a food faddist (vegetarian, health foods,
etc.).
9.03.09
None of these descriptions really fit.

9.04.20
Is there anything special about his drinking habits that requires
mention? If so, please describe:
9.05
Overall impression of drinking behavior: (Check the most appropriate)
9.05.01
A hearty, heavy drinker who holds his liquor well. He is
always rather bioterous, and when he drinks, there is little
change in behavior.
9.05.02
A heavy drinker who often gives the impression he can drink
others under the table: When he drinks, there is little change
in behavior, but there is a hint that he could get quite mean
if provoked.
9.05.03
A steady drinker who obviously enjoys being "right." In a way
he can be somewhat charming when drunk and can get away
with a bit of the "life of the party" routine.
9.05.04
A steady drinker who becomes somewhat more maudlin when
drunk or tight. Tends to tell people how much he likes them
and sometimes asks others whether they like him. Gives an
impression that he could become quite disgusting if he got
very drunk.
-28-


164
9.05.05
A steady drinker who holds his liquor very well. He al-
ways remains quite dignified and usually maintains his poise
even though others are becoming quite drunk or tight. He
still remains part of the crowd, however-that is, he gives
few signs of being disgusted or bored.
9.05.06
A light drinker who paces his drinks. He seems to drink only
because it is socially necessary. As a party progresses he
tends to become aloof and distant. Is likely to continue to
talk about his work even when it is inappropriate.
9.05.07
A light drinker who tapes off as the evening progresses.
Usually manges to keep a sophisticated oloofness from
others. Often singles out and associates with someone
rather like himself. As the party progresses, he shows
obvious distaste for anything he considers crude or bois-
terous. Often becomes quite sarcastic about others'
behavior.
9.05.08
A very light drinker who either drinks only because he
has to or refuses to drink at all. Is usually not really
a part of the party and is obviously annoyed when others
bring him in against his wishes. Tends to be solitary
and sometimes will leave unobtrusively when the oppor-
tunity presents.

(Check the most appropriate description.)
10.03.01
An active, alert individual with a purposeful stride who appears
to have a very practical mind. He enjoys "fixing things," op-
peors to have sound knowledge of automobiles, and drives in c
relaxed efficient manner.
10.03.02
An active individual who is somewhat standoffish (or negative)
toward others. His stride is fast and intent. He appears to
have a practical mind, is quite possessive and protective and
is reluctant to share his possessions with others. He "fixes
things" in a matter-of-fact way, appears to have good know-
ledge of automobiles, and drives in a determined (sometimes
even hostile) but efficient manner.
10.03.03
An active, alert individual with a free-and-easy stride who
appears most of the time to be in good humor. Seldom tries
to fix things, but is often quite good at getting others to fix
things for him. He appears to have little knowledge of auto-
mobiles but drives in a relaxed, efficient manner.
10.03.04
An active individual who has a cautious tinge to his walk as
though he is easily embarrassed or easily startled. He appears
rather helpless and awkward when he has to "fix things." He
evidently has little knowledge of automobiles and drives in a
careful (sometimes tense) but efficient manner.
10.03.05
A well-controlled and attentive individual who walks in
something of a clipped, formal manner. Although generally
practical, he seldom will do anything by "feel." He must
read up and prepare himself when required to "fix things."
He appears to have acquired considerable knowledge about
automobiles but drives in a somewhat mechanical or highly
controlled manner.
10.03.06
A well-controlled individual who is often somewhat preoccu-
pied even in his walk. When he takes time to "fix things" he
does so with intensity and precision. He is often very well
read about automobiles and cares for his car or sees that it is
cared for meticulously. However, when involved in conver-

sation or otherwise preoccupied, he can sometimes be quite
a dangerous driver.
10:03.07
A well-controlled individual who has a glide (or grace) in
his well. He has little or not interest in "fixing things"
but usually knows the best places to get things done and is
inclined to be quite particular in how things are done for
him. He appears to have relatively little knowledge of
the mechanics of an automobile, but appreciates and takes
good care of a good automobile. He drives with confidence,
but usually at a fast pace with not too much awareness of
others.
10.03.08
A rather nervous and temperamental person who walks rop-
idly and rather awkwardly. He has little or no interest in
"fixing things" and is inclined to ignore or throw away
things that do not work. He appears to have little interest
in or knowledge. about automobiles and his driving shows it.
It is sometimes frightening to ride with him.

11.03
Overall impression of temperament and sense of humor:
(Check the most appropriate description.)
11.03.01
He is a hearty, hale fellow who laughs with gusto and pleasure.
His humor is forthright; not subtle, and although he is sometimes
loud, he is rarely unpleasant or objectionable. Most of the
time, his good humor is contagious.
11.03.02
He is a hearty fellow who, when he laughs, does so with con-
siderable gusto. However, he is frequently door and sometimes
intolerant and somewhat humorless. His humor is direct, even
crude, and at times, inappropriate. He tends to be the kind of
person who laughs more at people than with people.
-40-


14/20/00
176
11.03.03.
He is a good-humored fellow who sometimes can be considered
jolly and corefree. His humor is clever and well timed. He is
quite sensitive to the moods and feelings of others and often
can do a good job appropriately living up a party. Although
something of a taste, he is never cruel or insensitive.
11.03.04
He is generally a rather quiet and somewhat complacent person
who, at times, can be surprisingly gay and corefree. However,
when goy, he sometimes. overdoes it and causes some strain for
those around him. His humor is often clever but he can be
quite soracatic and even biting on occasion.
11.03.05
He is an urbanne fellow, generally quite conventional and appro-
priate. He does not necessarily appear to be a humorless. person,
but he seldom displays his sense of humor. It is sometimes diffi-
cult to tell whether he is in a good humor, because of the way
he covers or controls his feelings. His humor is more studied
than spontaneous yet it is never crude or inappropriate.
11:03.06
He is a dour and humorless person, always serious and intense.
It is difficult to joke around him partly because he is not re-
sponsive and partly because he seems to disapprove.
11.03.07
He is a sensitive, sophisticated fellow with a subtle wit. He
can be quite charming and amusing in the right sort of setting.
However, there is something of an aristocratic quality to his
sense of humor and he can be quite condescending towards
people who do not understand or appreciate his sense of humor.
11.03.08
He is on arty, somewhat cynical person who can be quite
flippant or times. His humor tends to be a bit for out. He
seems to have private jokes he shores with intimates. It is
sometimes difficult to tell whether he is being amusing or
subtly hostile.
11.03.09
None of these fit. I would describe him as:

12.02
Overall impression: Which of the following best describes him?
12.02.01
He is an earthy, lusty man who shows little embarrassment about
sex. He treats women appropriately, but makes little effort to
conceal his admiration and attraction. He appears virile and
self-confident with women, and most women seem to like it.
12.02.02
He is an earthy, lusty man who on occasion can be crude or
even vulgar. He treats women rather harshly, and can become
quite pushy when attracted to a woman. He seems to be very
proud of his virility. Many women would be offended or re-
buffed by his aggressiveness, but this does not seem to bother
him.
-43-


140000
179
12.02.03
He is a somewhat sexual, rather soft man who is very coraid-
erate of women. He is prone to hold a woman's hand overly
long when talking to her and frequently puts his arms around
women he admires. He often uses flattery and-compliments
but does so rather graciously. Most women usually like his
attentiveness.
12.02.04
He is a sensual person, but is embarrassed and insecure about
it. He is a rather soft man who tries hard to be inoffensive.
However, he will-frequently follow attractive women with his
eyes when he thinks no one is. looking. He is also prone to
brush against or touch women "accidentally" whenever he gets
a chance.
12.02.05
He is a self-confident, rather polished person who is proper
and conventional with either men or women. He is always
considerate and polite with all women and it is difficult to
ascertain what his sexual attitudes and interests might be.
In a/group, he always behaves according to protocol and
usually can be quite efficient in doing so.
12.02.06
He is a self-confident and precise person who has something
of the air of a professional man about him. He is polite,
almost to a fault, and is inclined to go out of his way to
light a woman's cigarette or see that she is properly taken
core of. Nevertheless, he shows considerable distance in
his relations with women. Sometimes his formality is out
of place, but he will rarely, if ever, change his manners
or procedures to fit the situation.
12.02.07.
He is a charming, urbone person and both friendly and
sophisticated. He deals with women in a cultured way
but shows little sensuality or sexual inappropriateness.
He is neat, even dapper, and can be quite fastidious.
Most of his relations with women appear. to be quite pla-
tonic. He is the kind of person who likely has several
very close friends who are women.
12.02.08
He is a somewhat shy and indifferent person whom some
people consider odd or unusual. He shows little or no
interest in women in public. In general, he is a preoc-
cupied. person who only seeks out people with similar
interests. There is an ascetic, sexual air about him
most of the time.
12.02.09
None of these fit. I would describe him as:

1. On 29 January 1969, Samuel J. KARTASUK met with Subject to
deliver the appointment pitch's advised by Reis. Subject initially
refused to complete the grounds that he does not want to get
involved in this type of the problem. The second given the same
answer to "the other side. He readily admitted that he was
under intensive development by Valentin LOGINOV (201-285412) to spot
Mexican students who eventually may go to WOLADY; he denied, however,
the students are accepted the money LOGINOV continually offers him.
Subject volunteer family CHERNYSH (201-825743) is currently
developing one of Subject students (which we know), and that Subject
would like to foil CHERNYSH.
2. In spite of Subject's expressions of reluctance to be recruit
he answered a number of questions put to him by KARTASUK and he
agreed to a follow-up meeting on 7 February. At that meeting, he
was asked to provide hisive questioning about his background, family,
and his association with the overall community. There were no attempts
at evasion and many of his answers to the group. He was informed
that was:already known from other sources. Subject agreement continue
meeting clandestinely with KARTASUK and to provide additional
information on his contacts with LOGINOV and other members of the KGB.
3. Subject's activities immediately following the pitch were
monitored closely by LIEMBRACE and by LIFEAT for the week between the
two meetings. The second meeting was counter-surveilled with negative
results. Although the recruitment is still tenuous, we believe that
it comes he firmly commented and that Subject is committed whether or
not he is ready to admit it to himself at this point.

Summary.
1. As reported by Ref A, Samuel J. FARTAUSK succeeded in meeting
with Subject in Acapulco and in sponding nearly a full weak with him
for the purpose of establishing rapport and assessing him for possible
recruitment per Ref B. Assees, the book KARTASUK and LIOVAL-1
indicates that the nationally apolitical with attitudes as
described in the co-Boviet. KARTASUK believes, however, that he could
be recruited to work against FISERAL intelligence if he were made to
believe that he is not working against the FISERAL people.
2. Recent LIPFAT reveals that Subject is having a trial problems
and that he consented to see a psychiatrist after his rational good
her throats to leave, Accordance, and the doctor, as long as good as
"psychopathic" with a "preventing from his mother's possessive
attitude. The character assessment by KARTASUK agrees with that of
LIOVAL-1, but neither has called Subject "psychopathic."
2. While we recognizing possible problems, we feel that a
recruitment attempt should be made by KARTASUK. Following the
recruitment we plan to have KARTASUK sover further relationship with
Subject and to handle the case from inside where it can be monitored
more closely.

Meeting
4. As reported previously, KARTASUK went to Acapulco in early
November and succeeded in meeting Subject, whose plans for a vacation
there with his family were confirmed by LIFAT. The "chance meeting"
came about naturally in the hotel lobby when Subject's precocious
four year old daughter approached KARTASUK on the morning of 5
November.
5. KARTASUK used an alland and played the role of a successful
public relations man from the City who were recently widowed. He had
an important role in term tourist to help piece together his
shattered world. Thore was instant rapport between KARTASUK and both
Subject and his wife which permitted him to spend almost the entire
week alone with them. As a result, KARTASUK got to know them
intimately and to probe naturally into Subject's character, politics,
and family relationship.
Assessment
6. The work that KARTASUK and LIOVAL-1, Subject appears to be essenti-
ally political or at least, politically naive. He expresses
similarly occasionally admiration for both YIZATAL, where he lived for 17
th century and for WOLADY, where he would like to live. He believes that
the political system in each is right for each and that the world
system would work for the other. He feels that he has been just
VOLADY citizens want peace and are basically possible but that both are
victims of their political systems. Although Subject wanted at one
time to return to YIZATAL, he lown that he has a better life in
Boxics.
7. Subject is an easy-going; extremely pleasant extrovert with
a wide circle of friends whom he seen frequently. He has fow
scruples in regard to marital fidelity and, while his wife isnot
happy with his affairs, they have apparently arrived at some sort of
working agreement on the day.
8. Subject to told both KARTASUK and LIOVAL-1 that he earns
about the person per month and is, therefore, forced to live on a
modest scale. While he would like to live better, he is not ambitious
and does not let work interfere with pleasure. LIOVAL-1 feels that
Subject would find easy money a great temptation, that Subject could
be influenced fairly easily, and that principles would not stand in
his way.
9. The with KARTASUK, Subject spoke of his mother on several occasions.
He acemes her of possessionness and claims that it is for this reason
that he rebels against anyone's possessing him, including his wife.
This problem is apparently genuine as confirmed by LIFAT in recent
take. Subject consented to peychiatric treatment when his wife made
good her threat to leave him (though she returned after several days).
For LIFAT, Subject said that he has been diagnosed and psychological
and that the psychiatrist lays the blame at his mother's feet.
Conclusions
10. LIOVAL-1 has assessed Subject since early March 1968 and
KARTASUK assessed his during a week of uninterrupted close association.
Both assessments are virtually identical in all major respects. There
is little doubt that Subject does, indeed, have some personality
adjustment problems and that, if he is recruited, he will require firm
handling. Neither KARTASUK nor LIOVAL-1, however, describes Subject
as "psychopathic."

II. KARNASEK believe there is a reasonably good possibility
that Subject would consent to recruitment, if the approach were made
in such a way as to make him bolieve-that he is working against
FJSTELA intelligence modelling and not against the FJSTKAL people and
system. Additionally, we believe it may be possible to introduce
stability. into Subject's life, to give his firm direction and goals,
and to turn asso of his liabilities into assets.
12. Following successful recruitment by KASTASUK, the case will
be handled by an inside case officer so that developments can be
monitored more closely through other aspects and the risk reduced.

ACTION SERVICE- REFERENCE
1. Transmitted herewith is a report prepared by Keith
R. LEVENDRIS which details how LOGINOV used Ernst G. GAZITZV
(201-795374) to spot and set up a meeting for assessment
purposes with Jorge "KITAIS Buerba, a teacher at the Mexican
North American Cultural Institute in Mexico City. The Soviets
have long had an interest in the Institute and its personnel
because most of newly arrived Americans study Spanish there.
GAZITZV has attended the Institute since his arrival in Mexico,
first studying Spanish and then English.
2. We are forwarding this report because it is a typical
illustration of LOGINOV's modus operandi and because it clearly.
shows that GAZITZV at least has the status of a KGB, cooptee.

SUBJECT: Jorge ALIA'S Buerba
CARDID
DOR 42
CUT.MeYICO
1. Subject is a 26 year old Mexican citizen (although he
10000
looks to be in his 30's). No is a Spanish teacher at the Mexican-
Rachis at the
MEXICION North American Institute and since the fall of 1967 has held a
second job as the director of the Community Services Program
at the American School. In April 1967 he married an American
citizen from the Chicago area named Donnd WEINTHALLER (phohetic).
They live at Juanacatlan 15, which is just around the corner
from the Soviet Embassy. Home phone is 15-28-49.
2. Subject was recommended as a Spanish tutor in August
1966 by Enrique GUTIERREZ Martínea (P-12667), who was then
C/SB's Spanish tutor. GUTIERREZ was subsequently recruited by
C/SB as a utility agendybut has since been dropped because
he is related to other Station assets. On GUTIERREZ's recomienda-
tion, I began taking private Spanish lessons from Subject in
August 1966. I found Subject an excellent teacher and continued
to be a good job.

my wife and I had Subject as a teacher in Spanish courses we
took at the Mexican-North American Institute. I have maintained

kept informed to some extent about Subject through his younger
brother, Javier ARIAS Buerba, from whom I have been taking
Spanish lessons since July 1967.
3. Subject was a casual contact of Station officer Olivia
C. RAGNITY in 1965 and 1966. onth than a file card noting
this contact,
Station traces on either Jorge or
Javier ARIAS Buerba.
4. Subject and I from the beginning have had a very friendly
and informal relationship. He is an intelligent person with a
friendly, open personality and a good sense of humor. Politically,
he is pro-American to the point that he magnifies our strengths
and positive qualities and tends to minimise or overlook negative
factors in our society. Subject knows I am with the Political
Section of the Embassy and that I have been in the Soviet Union.
We have consequently gotten onto the topic of Russians and
Communism several times, and he has always come out a strong
anti-Communist. He has one brother and two sisters living in
the United States. The brother is married to an American and
lives in Virginia, where he is in the construction business.
One of the sisters is also married to an American and lives in
California (I believe San Francisco). The second sister is
married to a Polish immigrant and lives with him in Chicago.
The sister in C'libronia is a naturalised American citizen. The
brother and the sister in Chicago are not.
5. On 24 April 1967, LIENVOY reported the following call
from GAZIYEV to LOGINOV:
GAZIS "I saw him, he arrived yesterday."


14/0000
203
LOG: "Excellent. Then I'd like to see you to discuss
certain things."
GAZ: "Then I can come there tomorrow?"
LOG: "No, better Wednesday."
GAZ: "All right. He usually comes there at 6 o'clock.
No got married and came here with his wife. Now
they look for an apartment. I'll go there on the
10th, because I want to attend courses in English.
This week I'll be busy."
LOG: "OK, until the next then."
6. From this conversation, it appeared that GAZTIEV was
probably talking about Subject, since:
(a) GAZTIEV had been taking Spanish at the Mexican-North
American Institute and I knew from Subject that Subject had had
GAZTIEV in one of his classes, that Subject occasionally chatted
with GAZTIEV after class; and that GAZTIEV had once given Subject
an invitation to a. consular night at the Soviet Embassy (although
Subject told me he had not gone).
(b) Subject had gotten married that month.
(c) Subject had just returned to Mexico with his bride.
(d) Subject and his wife were looking for an apartment.
(e) Subject normally arrived at the Institute at 1800
to teach evening Spanish classes.
7. Prior to this reported telephone conversation, I had
considered using Subject as an access agent against GAZTIEV,
but had decided not to approach Subject on the matter unless
there was evidence that his relationship with GAZTIEV was
developing into something more than occasional chats between
classes. I did not see much potential in approaching Subject
before this with detail the idea of having him deliberately
cultivate a friendship with GAZTIEV, as I felt Subject was living


14/0000
204
such a busy and hectic life that I would get very little out
of him. Prior to his marriage, he was keeping such a hectic
schedule between his Institute and private classes that he
wasn't sleeping or eating properly and was having increasing
problems with his health. If anything, his pace and health
problems increased after his marriage and his taking of the
job with the American School (although he gave up most of his
private classes).
8. Since the GAZIVEV-LOGINOV conversation made Subject's
relations with the Soviets look much more interesting, I attempted
to find out what I could about them from Subject. For a number
of reasons, however-including my going to the States in June--
we were not able to get together until 11 July. On that date
I took Subject to a belated "bachelor's lunch" at a little
Spanish restaurant downtown
9. The lunch was disappointing and, for me, misleading.
I was certain that if given the opportunity, Subject would
voluntarily tell me if his relationship with GAZIVEV had
developed any further. When I caaually brought the conversation
around to GAZIVEV, however, Subject simply told me that GAZIVEV
was still studying at the Institute and that he still occasionally
9
chatted with him in the halls or over a cup of coffee in one
of the near-by coffee shops during the 20-minute break between
the two evening classes. Subject commented that he enjoyed
talking with GAZIVEV, as he was a simpatico, interesting guy,
as well as an outstanding Spanish student. He also added that
they never talked politics. In reply to an offhand question
about whether he had met any other Soviets through GAZIVEV, Subject


14/00/00
205
said that he had not. My inclination was to believe Subject, and
I went away thinking that either GAZIYEV and LOGINOV had been
talking about someone else over the phone or that they had
never gone beyond the stage of simply talking about Subject.
10. On 1 November 1967, I ran into Subject and his brother
Javier in Sanborns-Insurgentea. They were about to have a
quick lunch and insisted that I join them for a cup of coffee.
As soon as we sat down, Subject told me he had a problem and
would like my advice. He said GAZIYEV had given him an invitation
to the 7 November celebration of the Revolution at the Soviet
Embassy, and although he would like to go for the experience,
he was very concerned that his name would be put on "the black
list" at the U.S. Embassy if he went. He said that he had
tried to call me at the Embassy after he got the invitation to
ask my advice, but had been told I was out of town. (I was in
El Paso from 25-29 October.) He stated that if he had not been
able to reach me in the next day or two, he was going to simply
walk into the Embassy and ask to see someone from the "security
department" about his predicament. What did I think he should
do?
11. I told Subject to relax and forget about going to the
U.S. Embassy, as the Embassy would not give him any advice
other than to tell him that it was entirely his own business
whether he went to the Soviet reception or not. Besides, I
asked, what made Subject think his name would be put on a
"black list" if he went. Subject replied that he didn't know
how the U.S. Embassy did it, but "everyone knew" the U.S.
Embassy obtained the names of everyone who went in and out of
201-285412


206
the Soviet Embassy. Moreover, he said, even if the U.S. Embassy
refused to give him any advice, at least it would make a
regord
of his visit and anyone who was ever interested would his
heart was in the right place. He simply did not want and couldn't
afford to get into any trouble with the U.S. Embassy, he said.
After all, he had an American wife, he might want to go to the
States to study sometime; and they might even want to go to
the States to live someday. Seeing that Subject was indeed very
serious, I became more serious myself and told him that just so
he wouldn't worry, I'd write a memo to the proper Embassy
department stating for the sake of the record that Subject had
told me he planned to attend a Soviet Embassy reception, but
wished the U.S. Embassy to know he was doing it solely out of
work
curiosity and was in no way in sympathy with the Soviet Union.
You
Subject seemed greatly relieved and thanked me very much.
om
12. Seizing of the fact that GAZTIEV had given Subject the
Sut
invitation, I asked if Subject saw much of him anymore. Subject
n-M
replied that yes, he still saw him occasionally, as GAZTIEV was
co
now studying English at the Institute. Subject added, on his
from initiative, that he had also been to GAZTIEV's apartment
to
twice and had met another Soviet there on one occasion. He said
day
that the first time he went to GAZIEV's was shortly before he
(Subject) got married (Subject with was married about mid-April
1967) and the second time was shortly after his marriage, as he
and his wife had gone to dinner at the GAZTIEVS'. Subject finished
eating about this time, and since he was in a hurry and had
his brother with him, I didn't try to question him any further,
but decided to wait and have a second go at him alone another


14/00/00
201
time.
13. My wife and I entertained Subject and his wife at our
home on 27 November, but the evening was not meant to and did
not afford an opportunity to discuss the Soviets any further.
Subject did tell me, however, that he had not gone to the
7 November Soviet reception afterall, because, despite by
assurances that there was no reason for him not to go, he
felt it was simply safer to stay away from the Soviet Embasay
altogether. At my suggestion, we agreed to get together for
lunch sometime in the near future.
14. For various reasons, including the poor state of
Subject's health when I called him one day in January, we did
not get together for the lunch until 7 March. This time, I
played it straight with Subject, told him that I was interested
in anything he could tell me about GAZIYEV and the otherSoviet
he had met, and questioned him closely regarding the details.
Subject was completely cooperative; and I am satisfied he answered
my questions to the best of his ability. It seemed to me, and
still does, that there was only one possible reason why Subject
had not told me on 11 July what he subsequently told me on
1 November (i.e., that he had been to GAZIYEV's home twice and
on one occasion had met another Soviet there). This was that
he felt somewhat guilty about going to GAZIYEV's and meeting
the other Soviet there, and as long as I didn't push him too
hard (which I didn't on 11 July), he felt more comfortable
ignoring it. The reason he so readily mentioned the two visits
and the other Soviet on 1 November was, I think, that he was
genuinely concerned not to "get into any trouble" with the U.S.


208
Embassy over attending the Soviet Embassy reception, wished to
impress me with his sincerity about whose side he was on, and
felt obliged to completely clear the record by mentioning the
visits to GAZIYEV's home and meeting the other Soviet there.
15. Subject stated that GAZIYEV had invited him to his
apartment for dinner about a month before he (Subject) went to
Chicago to get married. This means that the dinner took place
about mid-March 1967. Subject said he had expected to find
only GAZIYEV and his wife in the apartment, but that a third
person was there when Subject arrived. Subject said GAZIYEV
introduced the third person as Valentin "something." When I
asked if the last name wore LOQINOV, Subject immediately reacted
and said he was almost positive that was it. Subject's description
of the Soviet also fit LOQINOV. GAZIYEV stated that LOQINOV was
with the Embassy (Subject couldn't remember in what capacity) and
described LOQINOV as a good friend. Subject said that the evening
started off very casually; with LOQINOV expressing interest
in the Spanish courses at the Mexican-North American Institute.
LOGINOV, who Subject noted spoke almost as good Spanish as most
of the Spanish teachers at the Institute; said he'd like to get
a certificate in Spanish from the Institute and asked Subject if
he could help him enroll, choose the best course for him to
start with, etc. Subject replied that he'd be happy to, although
it didn't seem to him that LOQINOV needed much instruction in
Spanish. LOGINOV simply laughed this off, and it was agreed
LOGINOV would drop around to the Institute sometime soon.
LOGINOV, who took the lead in the conversation most of the
evening, then began to ask Subject questions which left Subject


209
with "no doubt" that he (LOGINOV) was trying to feel Subject out
on his political views. Subject said that he couldn't remember
most of LOGINOV's questions; but he did recall that LOGINOV
began the feeling-out procedure by asking Subject if he didn't
find that the Americans were much poorer at learning Spanish
than other nationalities. Ho also made various derogatory
remarks about the extent of American influence in Mexico. Subject
said that after about ten minutes, LOGINOV's purpose became so
blatantly obvious; that he (Subject) stopped the conversation
and told LOGINOV that before they went any farther, he thought
LOGINOV should know that he was talking to someone who was
"100% capitalist," completely pro-American, and had absolutely
no sympathy with Communism. (While this sounds awfully blunt
and Subject was unquestionably trying to make himself look good
in my eyes, the fact of the matter is that Subject does tend to
be as* a bit blunt at times, and knowing his ideological leanings,
fr
I would not put it past him to have said exactly this.) Subject
said that LOGINOV tried to backtrak a bit after this, but the
an
conversation heated up again a few minutes later when Subject
11
commented that he had a pretty good idea of what the Soviets were
fr
up to in Mexico. When LOGINOV asked what Subject meant, Subject
t
related the story he once told me about having been in Veracruz
day
a few years ago when a Soviet ship was actually or virtually put
under arrest there. Subject told LOGINOV that "everyone knew
C.
the ship was loaded with Communist propaganda."
16. After about twenty minutes, according to Subject, politics
were dropped and the conversation turned to more innocuous topics.


14/20/00
Subject said that LOGINOV seemed somewhat. irritated with him, but
on the whole kept his composuro very well and treated Subject
politely for the two hours or less Subject remained. As Subject
was leaving, LOGINOV again said ho'd come by the Institute to
noe Subject in the neir future, but he. nover did. Ono day in
late 1967 Subject saw LOGINOV at the gas station on the corner
of Tacubaya and Juanacatlan, and LOGINOV greeted Subject by
name. However, they did not converse with each other.
17. Subject said that GAZIYEV left most of the politically
related part of the conversation to LOGINOV and never referred
to the evening again. However, a few woeks after Subject
returned to Moxico with his bride, GAZIYEV had Subject and his
wife over to dinner (this would place the second dinner in
about mid-May). This time GAZIYEV and his wife were the only
others present, and the evening passed without any reference
to politics. Subject stated that he still occasionally goes
across the street for a cup of coffee with GAZIYEV between
evening classes at the Institute, but that he has not been
to GAZIYEV's apartment again and has never had GAZIYEV to his
home.
18. Although Subject was very aware that LOGINOV's purpose
in meeting him was to assess his exploitability, he did not seem
to fully appreciate that GAZIYEV had both fingered him for
LOGINOV and set up the situation for LOGINOV to meet him. I
spelled this out for Subject and also informed him that LOGINOV
was an exceptionally capable Soviet intelligence officer. I
also explained that it was very possible GAZIYEV was using the
Institute to spot other candidates for interviews with Soviet
201-285412


211
intelligence officers, and questioned Subject about GAZIYEV's
activities and contacts at the Institute. However, Subject said
that as far as ho could tell GAZIYEV pretty much stuck to himself
at the Institute and did not have any particular friends there
whom Subject knew about. Subject said he would keep his eyes
open for the type of thing I was looking for, however, and would
let me know if he came onto anything interesting. Subject also
offered to "play up to" GAZIYEV and/or LOGINOV under my guidance
if I wished, but I declined the offer with appropriate expressions
of appreciation.
19. The question that remains unanswered after all this is,
of course, why LOGINOV and GAZIYEV wore talking about Subject
over the phone on 24 April 1967. According to Subject, the
dinner which LOGINOV attended took place in March 1967, while
LOGINOV did not attend GAZIYEV's second dinner, which took
place about mid-May. Since I am satisfied Subject told me the
truth, it would appear that the "certain things" which LOGINOV
told GAZIYEV on 24 April he wished to discuss with GAZIYEV
concerned how to handle Subject in the light of the LOGINOV-
Subject encounter in March. Whatever LOGINOV had in mind on
24 April, it would appear that it was finally decided that
GAZIYEV and his wife should simply have Subject and his wife
over to a peaceful dinner in order to at least partially erase
the memory of the first dinner.

CONINUATION OF
DISPACIN
16:97
2. In a written report on his visit to "orico in December
1967, the visiting LIGLOUS case officer recapitulated the
Station's Operational Plan for LIEAEL-1 which included the
following points:
a. "Penetration, monitoring, analysis and
study of the FRI are to be LIRELI-1's first ob-
jective".
b. (FRADYEN) "urged LIRALI to spot and
assess potential legal travellers to Cuba."
c. "A strong tertiary target is the (HEAVIRY)
Embassy."
d. "Indonesinns, Egyptians and Soviets have
been discarded as target.
When the U.S. has been Branch, Lewis W. EEAUCHAMP con-
tinued the above and said that the Station was considering giving
LIRELI-1 a going Cuban operation to handle. liss he yet been
assigned any contacts which bear on the Cuban target? LIRALI-1
was quoted as saying that he feels he can handle a heavier oper-
ational load, and so we are hoping that you have experienced
able to turn over to him once. The U.S. has the operations from
which they are in the country, thus broadening his experience
and increasing his self-confidence. Since LIRELIC-1 has been
returned we assume Subject is exploring new areas against the
LIGOLAL-1
3. We recognize that very often one-time tasks, spotting,
and research are performed by agents in the field without
Headquarters' specific knowledge. The U.S. has been able to think this
kind of the two available and necessary even though
the fact it may lead to dead ends, would give us a better under-
standing than we now have of the contribution which LIRALI-1
is making to the Station. Headquarters appreciates the opera-
tional reporting which the Station has been providing on LIRALI-1
and urges that it be continued on the same frequent basis.

1. As reported in reference A. LIREALEM-1 joined the
PBRUMEN Section of this Station on 20 October 1967. It was
decided that LIREALM-1 should drop further efforts against
tho-Soviet, U.A. for the Indonesian targets. The decision
of the American efforts to develop contacts among Mexicans,
also made at that timo; was later amended and LIREALM-1 was
entrusted with the handling of LIRELIC-1. The decision was
the recommendation made in references. Thus, by November
1967 LIREALM-1 had two main responsibilities: a) the French
target, against which he already had devoted considerable
time and effort, and b) the handling of LIRELIC-1.

CONINUATION OF
DISPAICH
SECRET
JINMA - 3-1668
2. LIREALM-1's efforts against the local French target
have produced some notable results. First, through detailed
analysis of personality and other data provided by LIREALM-1,
the Station selected an access agent to the official French
community who was later successfully contacted and was offered
a
contact (sco roicence C). The Station is already at work
with the American Association of the American Society. The
agent spotted and developed by LIREALM-1. It should be
emphasized that LIREALM-1 was in no way connected with the
approach made to the French access agent. The second item
on which LIREALM-1 has made progress has been the dovelopment
and the development of the American Society. The agent
general- courier inside the Embassy. This dovelopment, for
a
security reasons, has been slow. LIREALM-1's "lino" has been
that a person with "the ability" of the courier can and
the
person who is not a person who is not a person who is not
hold. The courier onded up taking that line as his own to
"protect" him (as he probably would have some trouble if the
Embassy discovered he was looking for another Job). LIREALM-1
started meeting the Mexican courier outside the French Embassy.
The
of the Embassy, the American Society, was a member of the
at some length without attracting the attention of the members
of the Embassy. This is as far as the Station will allow
LIREALM-1 to go in this caso, which is currently being reviewed
to decide who will continue the dovelopment of the Embassy
and the American Society. The American Society is not
connection with the person selected for this task. He will
continue to maintain contact with the courier but will start
to see him less often and will admit, in the end; that finding
a job for him turned out to be more difficult than expected.
3. LIREALM-1 méanwhile is continuing to cultivate a
number of selected members of the French Embassy and reports
to the American Society. He is a member of the Embassy
maintained contact for some months with a wealthy Mexican
businessman who is a good friend of DEVOSJOLY, the ex-French
intelligence officer who provided the material for Leon URIS'
best seller Topaz. LIREALM-1, in fact, had established
the American Society to show out whether of the book long before this
become known publicly. He has been a very popular
safe at the latter's house in Mexico City full of the world's friend a
probably belonging to DEVOSJOLY. This information was reported
to Headquarters via "special" channels.
4. LIREALM-1's handling of LIRELIC-1 encompasses two
targets. By far the more important one is LIOGLE. The goal
here is hopefully to turn LIRELIC-1 into a penetration of
the American Society. He is a member of the Embassy at
as a steppath stone. Some steps have been taken in this
direction. LIRELIC-1 has addressed personal requests for
assistance to current key LIOGLE personalities. He has also
submitted his curriculum vitae in the hope of landing a job
for his work. He is a member of the Embassy. He is a member
LIOGLE job offer. LIRELIC-1 realizes, of course, that he is
of no value to LNHARP unless he obtains a job giving him access
to hard information on LIOGLE plans and activities. The
promise of a regular salary of 1000,000 jobs, and the completely
effective role of the family to penetrate LIOGLE. In an
effort to maintain interim contact, however, and help LIRELIC-1
liquidate some personal debts, the Station, via LIREALM-1,
made him a loan of 3,000 pesos. Further details on the LIOGLE
aspects of the LIRELIC-1 operation will be covered in the
forthcoming LIOGLE/LIRLIC progress report. In addition to

the above, the station made an effort to explore the possibility
of using the fact which LIRIIC-1 had with a FERUMEN citizen
and the 100 to gain another window into LIRING. This PRUMEN
citizen owns a small hotel in the Mexican resort occasionally
visited by LIRING personnel. Although LIRILIC-1 himself once
diviered a package sent by his Acapulco friend and managed to
have one or two meetings with records of the hotel. The
contribution of the hotel was a possibility of "trading"
with PBRUMEN), it was decided in the end that LIRILIC-1's
access to LIRING was too superficial to be of any great benofit.
This decision was bolstered by the departure of the hotel.
April 1968 of the hotel, the hotel was also kept for what
the hotel was an extended visit to try to solve complicated
personal problems. Thus, with the "sholving" of possible
oporational activities against LIRING, LIOGLE became LIRILIC-1's
only target in April of this year.
5. Unlike his contacts with the French, LIRIAL-1's
docalings with LIRILIC-1 have been completely located in
LIRIEAL-1 meets LIRILIC-1 under alias 1 of the way
restaurants and other public places. A drop constituted by a
P. O. LIRIIC-1's and a public- l'indler alias (to-which both he
is the LIRIAL-1 have koy's) was set up for LIRIAL-1 to receive
operational mossages.
6. References D and E reviewed an incident which occurred
on 16 January and had a direct boring on LIRIAL-1's security.
In the same time, this Station that the person who saw
LIRIAL-1 talk with Raymond A. FRADYER and Wallace B. ROTTON
did not positively identify either of them. References stated
that this person could not have been Valentin Sergey.
LOGIOVY, who claimed to hold the hotel. The American Reference E
of the hotel was a smoking problem. The PRUMEN Section in October
1967 LIRIAL-1 had for some time interested himself in the
activities of the Soviets at Station request. He first made
contact with LOGIOV, for example, in April 1967. He had
also received a brief statement to the October 1967.
Reference E also pointed out that LIRIAL-1 only had four
meetings with the Soviet from October 1967 so January 1968.
The Station wants to emphasize once more than the American
at LOGIOV'S initial meeting of the Association included his efforts
to develop a new "davies with the Soviet at Station's directive.
As pointed out above, one of the main targets now handled by
LIRIEALM-1 is the French. One of the best places were
Frenchmen is the French Committee. The very reluctant
concerns the "davies" -time member of that club, terminate
his membership. Neither does the Station want him to be too
obvious in giving the cold shoulder to the Soviet. The Station
does not believe, knowing what it knows of LOGIOV, that
serious and permanent damage has been done TO LIRIALM-1's
security and believes that he can continue to provide valuable
services to this Station.

1. The purpose of this dispatch is to provide Headquarters
with additional information requested in reference B in the
hope that it will assist, the interested components in formu-
lating a clearer picture of the reference A incident. The
Station has consulted at length with Wallace B. ROWTON on the
details that are provided below as well as, of course, with
LIRALM-1, 1968.
2. First, with regard to paragraph 2b of reference B, a
fuller account of the FRADYER/ROWTON/LIREALM-1 meeting at
Sanborns will, it is felt, shed more light on the impressions
that Headquarters had formed of the probable identification of
ROWTON as LIREALM-1's "boss. The following chronological
account has been prepared by ROWTON from his reports and memory
of consultation with LIRALM-1 (the numbers in the left margin
reference to the time at which the events mentioned below took
place)
1610 (January 16) LIREALM-1 met with ROWTON at the
latter's home as planned. ROWTON informed
LIREALM-1, much to the latter's disappointment,
that unfortunately he had not as yet received
the reimbursement for operational expenses
(52,357.35 AM) requested by LIREALM-1 on
10 January 1968, nor had he received from the

Station any contract or other document that
LIREALM-1 might present to LIRELIC-1 as he
had proposed. ROWTON explained to LIRELIM-1
that he had hoped to be able to see Raymond A.
FRADYER before his meeting with LIREALM-1,
but that this had been impossible.
1620 ROWTON then telephoned FRADYER's office (in
alains, open code, and double the board and this
time for the meeting. The himself himself. FRADYER
had ROWTON that he had the money and could
pass it to ROWTON that same afternoon if he.
felt it necessary. ROWTON replied that he
preferred to pick it up and the time for the intent
of the meeting. He made a date for 1630 in the
corridor outside the Koala Restaurant, about
three or four minutes by foot from Sanborns.
ROWTON then asked LIREALM-1 to wait for him
to be given to the hotel. LIREALM-1, he
would join him with the money. LIREALM-1
left ROWTON's home alone, and ROWTON followed
about five minutes later and proceeded (by
taxi) to the Koala Restaurant. ROWTON
distinctly recalls waiting for FRADYER for
1645
ROWTON spoke with FRADYER for about two
minutes in the corridor after receiving the
envelope containing the money. In reply to
FRADYER's queries, ROWTON stated that LIREALM-1
was somewhat distinguished from the same
question. He was some sort of written contract
for LIRELIC-1 and also because of the delay in
reimbursing him for operational expenses (some
of which had been paid by the owner of the
corridor. FRADYER that LIREALM-1 was waiting
for him at the Sanborns bar so that he could
pass him the money without further delay.
FRADYER then regretted that he was unable
to be able to pay for the money to explain the
disallowance of some of the expenses. ROWTON
suggested that FRADYER might take this
opportunity to say a few words to LIREALM-1,
especially since the latter knew that ROWTON
and FRADYER were meeting at the same time
somewhere nearby. FRADYER agreed but said
that he has offered a question of Sanborns
to the bar.
1655 ROWTON then proved decided alone to the downstairs
bar of Sanborn and found LIREALM-1 waiting.
ROWTON explained that he was late because of
the time for the remaining arrangement with FRADYER for a
brief meeting in the gift shop. LIREALM-1
then paid the bill and accompanied ROWTON up
the stairs in the rear to the gift section,
where they found FRADYER looking over the
silver display in the shop.
1700 An apparently casual conversation then took
place, with FRADYER and LIREALM-1 doing most
of the talking and with ROWTON occasionally
examining the silverware on display.

When the conversation ended, ROWTON and

LINESLAM-1 moved to the cuc's room, where
LINESLAM-1 was able to check the amount of
money. For him and sign the enclosed receipt.
3. It was noted from the above that the ROWTON/
LIREALM-1 meeting with FRADYER was not planned in advance-
(as pointed out in reference A), but was a hasty recommendation
made to FRADYER by ROWTON and an equally hasty decision taken
by: FRADYER on the spot. ROWTON and LIREALM-1 had met previously
only in ROWTON's home, except for the 100% of the city.
picked up LIREALM-1. The city in the Ciudad Deportes (near
the main Noxle City, bull ring) between regular meetings to
pass him funds. ROWTON-had never not with LIREALM-1 at
Sanborn, in any other public place prior to this meeting.
4. LIREALM-1 also amplified his written report sub-
sequently in one significant detail. In reference to the
remark of LOGINOV to the office that he had seen his
boss at Sanborns two Wednesdays previously proposed "you had a
drink in the bar. The city was a county you boss," LIREALM-1 told
the
information that LOGINOV had also stated that "you
were having a drink at the bar and a man came up to you and
brought you to your boss." This indicates that FRADYER was
meant as the person described as LIREALM-1's boss.
5. With regard to where and how often the woman and
LIREALM-1 have had operation to be in the front past, as
the person was a woman who reference B, Station flies show
that between 20 October 1967 and 16 January 1968 ROWTON met
with LIREALM-1 at his home ten times. Besides these meetings
with LIREALM-1 at his home, ROWTON's house was a house
with LIREALM-1, when he was a woman who LIREALM-1 in his car for brief
time. The person has been funds. Since the LOGINOV/LIREALM-1
episode, ROWTON has met with LIREALM-1 at obscure bars to avoid
possible positive identification of ROWTON in the event.
LIREALM-1 was under surveillance, and the proposed his
reports to ROWTON who had been weekly meetings via a P.O.
100% of the city out previously by LIREALM-1 under alias.
In the only telephone contact that has existed between them has
been brief calls to ROWTON's home by LIREALM-1 alerting ROWTON,
in double talk, that he has left an envelope at the drop.
6. With regard to the frequency of LIREALM-1's meetings
with LOGINOV mentioned in paragraph 1.
LIREALM-1's contact with LIREALM-1 only four meetings during
the day, the 100% of all of which occurred at the French Club, and
one of which, on 2 November 1967, was a casual encounter at
which very few words were exchanged. It is single minute,
however, that at the 12 November 1967, he said that he has done
the 100% of the city in the showers after the match, the
latter "joked that (LIREALM-1) should bring some of his friends
from the Embassy" to join them in playing tennis. LOGINOV
added, also apparently with a slight number of people
and the 100% of the city's work was promptly reported,
did not consider it to have any special meaning since he knew
from personal and direct experience that: LOGINOV is a born
provocateur who cannot resist needling people and the
foreigners) with the same time. ROWTON's WOFIRM often
comes from the ROWON conversations, not only with FRADYER, but
the persons of other nationalities. It was decided, however,
to again warn LIREALM-1 at his next meeting with ROWTON
on 16 November, when LIREALM-1 submitted his report, not to
involve himself with LOGINOV. LIREALM-1 assured ROWTON that

his continuing contacts with LOIGNOV were at the latter's
initiative and that LIREALM-1 would not make any attempt to
follow up or show any unusual interest. LIREALM-1 did not
report seeing LOIGNOV again until 13 January 1968 (two months
later). this firm, as usual, on the tennis community.
7. Headquarters will recall that the HUMALM-1 relation-
ship with the Soviets dates back many from prior to the
date ROWTON took over his last year. The life reveals that
the 1968-1969 was 1969/01 on 22 April 1967, and that at
that time, LOIGNOV proposed to LIREALM-1 that they meet
regularly, every Wednesday, for tennis and occasionally take
in a movie with their wives. This leaves no more than the
pace was set by LOIGNOV himself since he undoubtedly saw in
LIREALM-1 a potential target. The idea of the notion was further
complicated by the character and modus-1's operandi of LOIGNOV,
as woll as the limitations of our own.
4. A principal idea of having the Case Officer with
regard to LIREALM-1's exposure to the Soviets has been his-
regular attendance at the French Club. Since the French target
of the 1968-1969, one's left to LIREALM-1 after the
elimination of the Soviet, Indonesian, and UAR operations, it
was considered necessary for LIREALM-1 to continue his normal
contacts with the French. Ho could have dropped his membership
in the club to avoid further involvement with the Soviets,
but this would have broken a long-established pattern and
deprived him of his principal and the most distant time. It was
therefore the first one's first product.
Subsequent developments appear to confirm the remark on
Station's view that LOIGNOV based his provocative remark on
a hunch or, at most, on a strong suspicion between
LIREALM-1. As-mentioned in paragraph 1, the conference B, such
that the 1968-1969 was 1969/01. American and a Soviet
"is almost inevitably construed on both sides to have intel-
ligence connotations. The Station wishes to emphasize,
however, that whatever suspicions were aroused in the mind
of LOIGNOV concerning LIREALM-1 were already generated months
before he joined the BPRUVN Section.
10: In conclusion, the Station feels that nothing has
been noted in the subsection of the organizational activity of FRADYER
and the American state either of them has been identified
as an intelligence operative. ROWTON has had no contact of any
kind with Soviets in this area, nor has he detected any
surveillance, either physical or technical, and a person
or home. Both he and FRADYER, in 1968, continue to
maintain maximum security. To avoid any further exposure to
such persons as LOIGNOV and LIREALM-1, on his part, has been
able to improve his cover by opening an office and making his
over activity as plausibly commercial as possible.

a. Why LECINOV would have said, "I saw you talking with
your boss the other day" we do not know, but the fact that he made
such a bual remark with a slight and certainly implies that he did
not have ordinary commercial business in mind.
b. In the context of the dispatch it sounds rather as
though LECINOV was reforcing to 1 meeting between LECINOV/1 and one
other man, not two, in which case it was probably NECTIN and not
FUNDYER when he identified as the bes. (No accuone that LECTIN and

LIREAL/1, but in 100001's case the less because of accepted
risks in lis style of operating and since we have always assumed that
his cover was thin
what is important to how in this case is
where and how often NOTC and INILW/1 have had operational meetings
in the past. Considering the use had assured the
neciting of the business.
4. Another point to be resolved is the frequency of LIREAL/1's
meeting with LIGNOY -- free the Reference we infer that the tonnis
gansos were a frequent occurrence, although LIREAL/1 had been told
alainst a year ago to break content. Even if the time was could not
have been avoided as the same time was they were they not
referred to. The cases on these on even added significance as we understood
the Station and Headquarters had been in agreement for sono tine
that LIREAL/1 was to avoid any continuing contract.
In this case, the LIREAL/1 was not a great reaction to the meetings of the carlier
lindsight in this case certainly proves the question. The most serious
judgment. (Experience shows that the second social contact botricn.
an American and a Soviet is almost inevitably construed on both
sides, and the most important to have an intelligence connotation.)
5. The fact that LIGNOV did not mention the Sanborn's meeting
to FRADEYER can hardly be read to mean that LIREAL/1 is clean in
LOGNOY's eyes, although FRADEYER would naturally have been anxious to
see what, if anything, would happen when he next saw LIGNOY face
to face. it is true that we have no evidence that LIREAL/1 has been
"definitely" branded as a "society" that was that if he is own highly
suspect. The "society" was a cause for deep conduction.
6. Various levels and components at Headquarters are trying to
evaluate and debate this episode, and we would like to have your
recommendations as an aid to our decision. From the few facts that
we have. we believe we must proceed under the asse of the LIREALM/1
is suspect or possibly compromise the question of the Soviets.
Accepting this, do you have been a LIREALM/1 has further utility in
the first time. We would like your views as to his proposed targets
and handling procedures. After receiving further details as
requested in paragraph 3 and your recommendations, Incundquarters will
advise you its decision.
7. We recognize the Station is as disturbed about this breach
of basic operational judgment as Headquarters and do not wish to
belabor the point. We trust that this experience will be a
lesson will learned and that in the future the Station's clandestine
operational procedures will be truly clandestine and professional
in style for all of the Station activities, not just LIREALM/1.

Action Required: FYI
1. Since joining the staff of the PBRUNEN Section of
this Station in October 1967, LIREALM-1 has been handled by
Wallace B. ROWTON under the over-all supervision of the
undersigned. His three main activities have been 1) to
be
established by the National Association of the National
penetration of the Mexican PRI, 2) to continue to develop
rapport with and report on the local official French community,
and 3) to determine the degree to which LIRELIC-I can develop
the 100% of the local government's personnel. LIREALM-1 has continued
to see a number of contacts with the local government's
the PBRUNEN Section, either at Station directive or by social
encounter. One of these contacts has long been Valentin
Sergeyovich LOGINOV, Second Secretary of the Soviet Embassy
and the National Association of the National Association of
playing tennis at the French Club, where both LIREALM-1 and
LOGINOV are members. Station several times asked LIREALM-1
to brock contact with LOGINOV, but this has not been possible
since LIREALM-1's continued membership at the French Club
is desired for operational reasons and LOGINOV, who probably
joined the club for similar reasons, has continued to be one
of its active members.

2. In January 1968 LIREALM-1 presented an account to
for reimbursement by the Station to which the Station took
exception. Some of the entertainment of marginal stock
involved totals which the Station's own stock is issue.
The "Sponsor" is a fairer some deliberation LIREALM-1
had to pay for part of these expenses out of his pocket. On
17 January 1968 ROWTON called the undersigned to ask about
reinbursement of those excisees to the Company. The
"Sponsor" is a fairer this purpose in the passage
way leading to the KodaL Restaurant, as ROWTON indicated that
LIREALM-1 needed the money as soon as possible. At the agreed
time the undersigned passed the Plan for the second issue.
The "Sponsor" is a fairer that LIREALM-1 was waiting in the
downstairs cafeteria of the Sanborns building. The undersigned,
who had not seen LIREALM-1 at Christmas time and genuinely
regretted the fact that the latter has been the same. The annual
report was to be made to see LIREALM-1 for a
600 minutes. When the undersigned-refused to go to the
downstairs Sanborns cafeteria, ROWTON suggested that he fetch
LIREALM-1 and bring him to the silver shop upstairs in the
same building. A 15-minute meeting (longer than expected)
was the first time in the LIREALM-1, and the undersigned in a
conner of the Sanborns similar to shop. The meeting started a
few minutes before 1700 hours.
3. On 28 January LIREALM-1 saw LOCI NOV at the French
Club. Tho following is a verbatia extract of the report
written by LIREALM-1 on this meeting.
I had joined Val and my wife on her side of
the court for small talk with Val. The apologized
for interrupting our game and suggested the stock back
to playing the game. He said. "We had made a.
"The "Sponsor" means Wednesday. He would call me if his
leg still bothered him or for any other reason he
was unable to play. Now he said he wanted to study
my game so that he was able to get the game. He
said he was able to far as the net where he stopped
me and the following conversation took place.
"I saw you talking with your boss the other
day," Val said with the other.
"I said that he asked. I suspected nothing and
seriously considered the question. I began to
search back in my mind if my cover boss had over
met Val. I recalled that he was a very good val
and my wife on her side of the operation proceeded too rapidly.
for me to answer my own question. The fact is
that Val has never met my cover boss.
"Yes. At Sanborns two weeks, you are
had a chance to get the same when talked to your boss."
"Two Wednesdays ago. At Sanborns? No.
You're mistaken. My boss left about six weeks ago-
almost two months ago. I didn't think that I
can't have to read Val honestly confused. We
began to wonder who I had been with. I've often
met people in the various SanLorns. I was trying
to think who Val was confusing with my boss.
"Yes. Your boss. You and your boss were
talked together at the last two weeks you
embassy.
"No Val. My boss left at least two months ago.
"I don't think that particular meeting at Sanborns
that you are referring to, but I'll drink with
anyone, anywhere, anytime." Val and I laughed.
Until this moment I was answering him honestly and
sincerely and might have been very convincing.

clear than that LOGINOV was not present at the time of the
meeting but was told that LIREALM-1 met with two Americans.
The members of the undersigned's conviction that whoever
saw-LIREALM-1 was unable to have been the same in the
the
th undersigned. The undersigned reasons that had LOGINOV
known that ho, the undersigned, had talked to LIREALM-1,
LOGINOV would have mentioned his name after failing to
be the President of the House. He was a member of the
latter's "boss;" The undersigned believes that LOGINOV, who
is not completely stupid, would have either said nothing or
would have gone all the way in his statements to LIREALM-1
and the members of the undersigned's name. By the same token it
appears that LOGINOV was not very much more than the
undersigned had only met with one other Soviet besides
LOGINOV at the time of the meeting, and that only once; and
that Soviet was no longer in Mexico City when the meeting
with LIREALM-1 took place. ROWTON has never had any contact,
social, and the industry with any of the Soviets.
5. The undersigned is the first to recognize that meeting
with LIREALM-1 at the Sanborns of the Jews a thoroughly
unwise move- He wishes to emphasize that this was the only
meeting at the time that he had held with LIREALM-1 outside
of a safehouse. All meetings between the undersigned and
LIREALM-1 have since been held under the most secure con-
sidered, but the message was the most important in the case,
beyond. While this does not make this decision any wiser, he
also wants to emphasize the fact that it was made on the spur
of the moment, to quote the old cliche, because the undersigned
was the most important. LIREALM-1 because of the latter's financial
difficulties with the industry. He said, he said, he said, he
undersigned unwisely put LIREALM-1's morale for a brief moment
over basic security considerations. He is not in the habit
of doing this as a matter of course. The day before his next
meeting was the most important. He was a working Wednesday,
LOGINOV called LIREALM-1 and asked to be exposed to
had worsened. The week after that LOGINOV showed up for his
regular tennis game with LIREALM-1 but made no mention of
the events. He said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he
undersigned waited to complain on the next two months.
he met LOGINOV face to face at one of the Consular Association
functions. Because of the visits of Soviet athletes and
the members of the LOGINOV busy, however, this meeting did not
materialize until the next two months after the undersigned and
LOGINOV talked to each other off and on for the next two hours
on this occasion during a visit to the local Home Fair, LOGINOV
never mentioned anything about the Sanborns meeting. He has
never brought LIREALM-1's name to the attention of the
undersigned.

details of the above incident by LIREALM-1. He also reviewed
the same incident with the undersigned answer. The

above, this did not occur until 28 March. Nothing in the
operations conducted by the undersigned, LIREALM-1, or ROWTON
has indicated that the Soviets positively identified either
the undersigned or ROWTON so as to definitely brand LIREALM-1
as a WOFIRN operator.

1. On 8 March 1968 after 201-827966 failed to show for two
scheduled meetings (on the previous evening he had agreed to
submit to a debriefing), the area of his hotel was checked by the
undersigned. On a main street near the hotel the undersigned
almost bumped into Valentin S. LOGIOV (201-314128). A few min-
utes were in the hotel, 201-277838) was observed photographing
as a new (including the underaion) of the hotel. The hotel
LOGIOV was standing near BARANOY observing the undersigned.
LILYRIC reports that LOGIOV and BARANOV were absent together
from the Soviet Embassy during the period in question.
2. Another meet with 201-827966 was arranged by telephone
for 12:30 on 9 March, From 12:28 to 12:48 the entrance to the
hotel where the meeting took place was staked out by BARANOV and
BARANOV. The hotel was held at the same time. The hotel was
camera with a larger telephoto lens. Visual identification of
DOLGOV was tentative. However in view of LILYRIC reports that
DOLGOV was absent from the Soviet Embassy for the period in ques-
tion and that all other possible candidates were accounted for,
the hotel and the 100-member personnel. In addition we have photos
the DOLGOV wearing sunglasses identical to the ones he were during
the counter-surveillance.
3. Although we have had previous indications that DOLGOV is
probably a KGB officer the Station feels that his participation
in this counter-surveillance is sufficient to list him as known
KGB.
4. We can also add photographer to BARANOV's technical
duties.

RADOAT/Teraination of Contact with Subject of Reference
REFERENCE: HMMW-16980, 7 December 1967,
1. A graft dispatch on Subject of Reference was prepared in
August, but through an oversight; was never typed and seat out.
As stated in that draft, Mexico City Station no longer has any
operational interest in Subject and does not plan to seek an
operational Approval for her. We regret this delay in reporting.
The text of the district department, and the
Department of the State of Australia. August 1967 that she planned to leave
for the United States within the next two weeks to marry an
American citizen and would thereafter settle in New York City.
She identified her fianco as:
Marty HARRIS
Age 35
152 E. 35th St.
New York, N.Y.
Tel. 686-0544
She said he is a textile engineer, but that she did not know the
name of the firm he worked for. HARRIS, according to Subject, is
Jewish. She said they will be married in early September in a

syngogroge in Philadelphia, which is HARRIS's parents' home. They
will thereafter take up residence at HARRIS's current New York
address.
3. Subject said that she had originally set MARRIS while he
was working in Mexico and had maintained a correspondence
with him. Iq July of this year, he called her from New York and
asked her to meet his in Cozuel the week of 24 July. During a
week together in Cozuel, they decided to get carried. Subject
said she thought that one day she would like to return to Mexico
with her husband to live, but that their present plans were to
remain in New York indefinitely.
4. In view of Subject's plans to leave Mexico indefinitely,
we now longer have any operational interest in her and do not plan
to make a new way to do this.
5. Subject stated she had had no social contact with Valentia
Sergoyevich LOGHOW (201-255-412) since December 1965, although she
had seen him several times on business since thon. She reported
on 11 May that her only noteworthy encounter with his since
December took place in April in connection with efforts on her
pulsified and the most important work. He was supported by GROVEY
Halded at granting the visa because of alleged personal disilts of
the applicant, but finally gave in as a "personal favor" to Subject.
He stated bluntly, however, that Subject should realize "a favor
must be repaid by a favor" and renewed in such more direct terms
of the same kind of the group of the group. The group of the
friends who was or was inclined to be sympathetic toward the Soviet
Union. Subject replied somewhat lippantly that she'd keep the
request in mind in case she not or thought of anyone in this
cigarette. He said, "I would be noted that LOGHOW had case
specifically and her if she had a good group of people, but that
she had dodged the question and he had not pursued.
6. LICOZY-5 told Francis J. COIGNS in June 1967 that on 5 June
LOQINOV had pressed his for inforunat on on the local Jewish reaction
to the Arab-Israel war. LICOZY-5 also stated that on E June
Subject, who was very excited about the war and had even gone to
the House. He said, "I would be not further to serve in Israel, had told 'in
that wona she returned home. He said, "I would be not the House
LOQHVO was waiting for her on the street and tried to pump her
for information on local Jewish reactions to the war. LICOZY-5
stated that Subject told hisa she gave LOQHVO hell for the Soviets'
support of the Arabs.
7. LICOZY-5 started that Subject told him that in March she had
been the first time and had been asked about her contact with
LOGHVO. She added, according to LICOZY-5, that she had seen the
same LOPURA officer (no name given, according to LICOZY-5) a couple
weles earlier. LICOZY-5 said that she also told him that LOGNOV
had asked her to introduce him to "one of her pressivist friends"
or "Someone in LOPURS."
5. The above represented a capsule account of Subject's
report of the House, and officer, Ruth H. LAVENDRI. GOINGS
played innocent until he got the whole story, but finally admitted
that we had talked to the girl. COIGNE told LICOZY-5 that Subject
had no idea that he was in contact with us and had in fact worried
that her activities in our behalf might create trouble for him.
Asked by COHVE who advice be had given Subject, huctest said
that he had been asked for truthful with the LOPURS officer and
to the careful with LOGHVO.
6. On 2 August, during a very friendly "farewell" lunch,
LEVENDRI'S asked subject both about her most recent contacts with
LOQHVO and whether anyone know of her contact with LOPURS. (See
had previously given the strongest assurances that she could be
counted on to keep this contact confidential.) Sith respect to

the first question, she stated that LOGINOV had cace to her
office a couple of times on viaa and Boviet travel busines, but
that she otherwise had not seen him. Although given ample
opportunity, soe maid- nothing about LOINGOV having waited for
the next day, he said: about or about his questioning her about
local reaction to the 1eramb war. As for the second
question, she asserted LAYENDERIS that she had told no one of
her contact with him or LAVENDER.
10. We are inclined to believe that Subject lied about nut
tolling anyone of her contact with us because it would have been
extremely embarrassing for her to admit that she had failed both
to follow instructions and to keep her promise. While it is un-
derstood, he said that the 1eramb war, he said, "I think
the second day of the Iarsali-Arab war) suggests it was the
result of her agitated state of mind, her anger at the Soviets for
their support of the Arabs, her possible imminent departure for
the 1eramb war. He said, "I think it was a very good
respect for LICOZI-5 as a follow pro-Zionist. (Subject, whose
mother is Jewish and vho because vornatically involved with Israel
and Zionisa after visiting Israel a couple of years ago, told
LIVENDRIS on 2 August that she had indeed gone to the Israeli
and 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000th

CONTACT REPORT
SUBJECT
: Elizabeth Duncan WILDS
DATE OF MEETING : 12 December 1967
1. A headquarters officer made arrangements by telephone for
me to interview the subjects on 12 December. She was told the I would
arrive at Toledo at 10:30 and call her: However, I made developed
mechanical trouble and I called her from Pittsburgh to advise that
I would be 3 hours late. I arrived at Toledo at 13:30 and called
her. We agreed that I would como to her mother's apartment at 14:30.
The interview lasted from 14:30 to 18:30. During the last hour we
were joined by her mother but, since she is senile and hard of
hearing, we were able to continue talking without interruption.
2. I introduced myself as Peter Clark from the Embassy in
Mexico, Subject accepted me without question and immediately began
tolling. He was a member of the President of the Department of
the political officer. The telling took only 10 minutes. I had
considerable difficulty in taking her through a chronological account
and holding her to one subject. It became obvious that she is a
very self-centered person who is not interested in others unless
he was a member of the President her which LGIMOV obviously did.
She is impossible on names; dates or times, asking me at least three
times during the interview to repeat any name. On the other hand
she was completely cooperative and did not appear to be withholding
or distorting information.
3. The following account of her contacts are pieced together
from her chaotic account and, thus, is by no means perfect:
a. She was in Mexico about 10 days on her most recent trip
and met LGIONOV about a week before she left (ca 10 November). She
met him at a party given by a Spanish couple (names forgotten) at
their home in the southern part of the city to which her host, Dr.
H. and her husband, who had been married in the United States, was
which included Mexicans, foreigners and diplomats. She met LGIONOV
through a German man whom she had just met (van Henrichs or Kondrichs,
no meaningful traces.) She talked to LGIONOV on and off,for an hour.
After an exchange of amenities she remarked that he spoke good English.
He said it needed improvement and asked if she would be willing to
give him lessons. She would like to but must leave in a week. He
asked it as much any American friends who could be able to
explained that she had friends when she lived in Mexico from 1954 to

1058 but they are 211 come now, however she offered to make
inquiries and suggested that he go to the American Embassy to find
a teacher. He answered that both the American Embassy and his own
would frown on the idea and would not think well of it. Later she
asked what he would do with his English once he had learned it.
He answered that he would like to go to the United States. "The
American Embassy was a very good thing. "He said, "Well we all
have to better ourselves". During this discussion he got the story of
her life including the fact that she has written a book which is
still in manuscript (see below). He expressed interest and asked
to read it. She said she had a copy and he asked her to drop it off
the world. "He was also said that he doesn't like Mexicans but pre-
fers the company of Americans who are more like Russians. Upon
parting it was agreed that she would drop by his embassy to give him
the manuscript.
b. Two days later, Mr. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M.
to her in the outside reaction area. She left him the manuscript
"He was a very good book up until she returned to Mexico. He
gave her his card. He told her that she shouldn't call his because
his phone was always tapped (she assumed he meant it was tapped by
his own people). He added that he supposed the same thing happened
at the American Embassy and asked, if she went there ofton. She
said, "He was a very good book. "He was a very good book in
inquired about her American friends in Mexico and she answered that
she had no curront ones. He again said he would like to meet
Americans and asked her again to look for an American who could teach
him English. On parting he said he would call her before she left
(he knew that she was leaving in a few days to take care of her sick
mother).
c. He called a day or so later and came over at ca 10:00
to Dr. MARIN's house where she was staying (not on LIENVOY). He
asked when she would be back and how could he contact her in the
United States. She gave him her mailing address and promised to
answer if he wrote. He again asked her to find him an English teacher.
He said, "He was a very good book. "He said, "He was a very good
Smiling, he answered, "Yes, who doesn't dream of going." He added
that he can't go anywhere until he learns the language. She asked,
if he would like to make a change. He answered that he has to be
careful because he has a mother and family in the USSR. (From this
Subject inferred that he would like to change and is only afraid of
penalizing his family). He felt on the note that she would try to
find him a teacher and would contact him upon her return to Mosaico.
d. Subject and Dr. MARIN agreed that LOKNOV was a fine
person and they should help him get a teacher. Dr. MARIN suggested
that Subject go to the American Embassy since they give English classes.

(Compont: Mexicans still commonly believe that the Mexican - North
American Cultural Institute is part of the Embassy). Therefore
Subject went to the Embassy on the morning of 16 December and was
referred to a Mexican girl on the second floor (USIS). Subject told
the Embassy, the President of the Embassy, and the President of the
the Institute. As she was leaving she thought that the Embassy
would be interested in her story and thus fell into the hands of the
political officer. She then went back to the Soviet Embassy but
LOGINOV was not in so she left the list of teachers with the guard for
him. She left Mexico the next day, 17 December.
4. LILYRIC photo coverago shows that Subject was at the Soviet
Embassy from 13:35 to 13:42 on the second floor leaving the American
Embassy in the United States. He noted in a taxi. LILYRIC also reports
that LOGINOV was out from 13:14 to 13:52 on that date which confirms
Subject's statement that he was not there. LILYRIC photo coverage
also shows that Subject visited the Soviet Embassy from 11:20 to
12:30. He was not the President of the Embassy. He was not first
visit to the Embassy). Again, LILYRIC has LOGINOV in the Embassy
from 09:07 to 13:45 on that date, thus confirming that Subject
actually did see him. Thus her first meeting with LOGINOV at the
party was probably on 8 or 8 November 1987. On 7 November LOGINOV
was at the reception in the Embassy. LIEINOV has no information on
a second report. He was not the President of the Embassy.
5. From her account it was obvious that she was extremely
impressed with LOGINOV both physically ("he is such a handsome man")
and as a person. From her conversations she concluded that he liked
Americans and was interested in meeting them, that he is really
interested in learning English so that he can go to the United States
and the American Embassy. In want his own people to know about those
breaths and intentions. He said, LOGINOV, did a line job in de-
briefing her and in keeping the fact open. This type of activity
has become standard for him in Mexico.
6. Although the subject of his marital status never came up,
Subject assumes that LOOINOY is single, "He acts like a single man".
He loves parties and dancing and sports. (Again, standard behavior
for him.)
7. BIOGRAPHIC DATA:
Elizabeth Duncan WILDE was born Elizabeth DUNCAN on 28
December 1918 in Tallahassee, Florida. Her parents were prosperous
farmers outside Tallahassee who lost everything in the depression.
They then moved to Toledo where her father and brothers gradually
built up a successful construction business. Her father died about
10 years ago. Her mother is 61 and is expected to live two or three
months. In 1942 she married Elliot H. JACKSON in Dallas, Texas.

They were divorced 4 years later. In 1948 she married William P.
STORY III in California. They divorced in 1948. In 1954 she came
to surveyed the 1956s to benefit scientific Institute for the correction of
the` society located at Redmond, New York, NY 10024. He said, "I

Russel H. WILDE in Norwalk, Conn. They have been separated for seven
years. WILDE who is 15 years her senior was for 37 years a member of

rently living with and caring for her mother at 2829 North Kondale
Dr., Apt. 101, Toledo, Ohio. Telephone 419-474-0348. She has no
children. She had a generous allowance from her current husband.
3. ASSESSMENT:
Subject was obviously a very handsome woman who appears to
have spent her better years running through a series of wealthy
husbands and lovers. As noted above, she is extremely self-countered
and is uninterested in other people as people. Thus she is a poor
villiant, but it is not a good thing. She is a good man who
went into great detail. on how American "ZIONISTS" control all the
information media in the United States and even influence government
policy. This is a "conspiracy" which is currently engaged in sup-
porting the "villiant" of the state. He said, "I have been a
This is the subject of her book, noted above. She has also had 4
accidents in the last four years (two fires in her home and two
automobile accidents) which she considers a plot against her. She
is
expected as an old, vindictive, and a more powerful man who has
concerned the most important role. Although Subject is not nearly as bad as
the above distillation would suggest, she is slightly unstable. Sho
is very much interested in heiping us against LGGINOV and stated
several times that she would cooperate completely. She is clearly not
suitable for a long-term or complicated relationship with LGGINOV but
could be used on a short term basis to introduce another person or
to smoke.
9. At the conclusion of the interview, Subject was told that,
although she had every reason to interpret events as she did, LGGINOV
specializes in contacting and developing Americans as he did her.
From her story, there was no reason to believe that ho was displaying
vulnerabilities. Thezofore we have no reason for her to attempt to
prolong the relationship or cultivate him. On the other hand she has
to contact him in order to get back her manuscript. She is not to
suggest further contact but is to report to us any further contact

initiated by LOGINOV. (Obviously dissporated, Subject. agreed to obey
instructions. After she has reobtained the manuscript she is to call
the Station (x870, Betty calling for Bill Smith) and set a time for
the moeting "at the house" (Dr. MARIN's) or at "the Cafe" (Cafe Mis-
sissippi). Subject expects to return to Mexico sometime in the spring
of 1968.
10. Dr. Federico MARIN is Subject's host in Mexico, He is
a
pediatrician who comes home of hospital or sanatorium (name and location
and known) in M. C. (X7) a. he served as a medical officer with the
U.S. Department of World War II. Subject first met him and his wife in
1954 when she opened her institute. Thoy have been close friends
over since. His wife died a. your ago. She gave his address as a
one of the most important people. She was a member of the
Duroo 54, telephone 11-63-60 (no Section 1). She was a
telephone member of the other. She is that I would not contact him
by the member of a Mexican, he wouldn't want to get involved between
sovieties and Americans. However, when Subject returns we intend to
set him through her to investigate his possible usefulness and as a
means of further assessment of Subject.
11. PLANS:
Debrief Subject after her next contact with LOGINOV and
meet and assesse Dr. MARIN for possible use.

invitations for the departite of one of LIRCERT-1's previous
provisions, and the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of the 100% of
interrupted and stated, "I'm inviting the teacher and I will give
him the invitation." KOVALSV made no further comment on the subject.
Later, when alone, KAZANTSEV told LIRCERT-1 that he was the "nusber
two man in the Soviet Eeabans." even though he holds the number three
positions. He referred to himself as the Charge d'Affaires. This was
the first time that KAZANTSEV had ever opieen of his rank or position
to be 1957.
3. On 17 August KAZANTSEV studied for one baur with LIRCERT-1.
LIRCERT-1 commented that KAZANTSEV's level of fluency exceeded all
of his other students. According to KAZANTSEV, upon his return hore
in June, he was required to take his English langage examination and
scored a final mark of 4.5 out of a possible 3. KAZANTSEV lost the
100% of the 100% of the 100% and not read any English language books
during the previous month.
4. On 24-August, KAZANTSEV stated that his wife had been having
stomach trouble of a undisclosed origin. She had just returned from
the hospital where she underwent tests to determine the nature of
her illness.
5. During the class of 29 August, KAZANTSEV read an article in
the English language newspaper, The New, pertaining to the diminution
of the male sex drive among heavy smokers. This triggered a long
monologue by KAZANTSEV on the evils of pornographic literature.
RAZANTREV found this aspect of western society disasteful and serving
no useful purpose.

possessing very strong and fixed ideas. KORNYUKIIN did not appear
to be aved by KAZANTSEV's official position and spoke openly and
forcefully to him.
20: On 29 November, during the course of a discussion,
KAZANTSEV and KORNYUKIIN again became embroiled in an animated debate.
KORNYUKIIN debated KAZANTSEV in an effective and energetic manner
seemingly unafraid of correcting or disputing KAZANTSEV. The
argument was not personal nor was there any apparent evidence of rancor
between the two.
20: On 29 November, KORNYUKIIN studied along with LIROCKET-1,
LINCKEST-1 soon discovered that KORNYUKIIN was soneuvhat of a chameleon
in his personality in that thes's completey difference without the
presence of KAZANTSEV. KORNYUKIIN manifested a friendly, affable, and
re右pensive manner, gratefully accepting any criticism from LIRCOKET-1
regarding his use of the language and giving up all pretensions of
the most important role in the development of the world. The most important
that KORNYUKIIN wants to be liked and that his character ambivalence
may be a front in order to impress KAZANTSEV. During their conver-
ation, KORNYUKIIN commented that he was having seme difficulty in
sidjusting to. Socice and ite weather. In discussing Indian, KORNYUKIIN
stated that India was better off than China, but that the indians
were immangable, unorganised, and uncontrolable. KORNYUKIIN started
for the purpose of imposed with Burma thana either India or Mexico.
NISCELLANEOUS
22. During the 28 September class, LROCERT-1 was sought out
by Yeongeny Nikolayevich GOLITSTYN (201-774322) who began talking to
LIRCOKET-1 in fairly adequate English, capable of making a conver-
sation. GOLITSTYN commeated that he preferred to study his English
along rather than in a class with a-tutor. GOLITSTYN also stated that
he would be required to take his English exam in the near future and
the first time. KORNYUKIIN was a very good example of the first time
prepared for it. GOLITSTYN stated that he wanted "to maintain his
20% bonus" by passing the English exam. LROCERT-1 views GOLITSTYN
as somewhat of a bumpkin; not particularly intelligent, but a piddler.
He appears to be a loser in his relationships with others of the same
nationalities.
285412: During this same class, Valentin Zeroycevich LGINGOV (201-
285412) spoke briefly with LROCERT-1. LIGINOV asked LIRCOKET-1 if
he would have time to teach English to his eight year old son.
LIRCOKET-1 stated that the hours requested by LIGINOV for lessons
would be impossible to accommodate. LOGINGV then began talking of his
society. The first time, he was a very good example of the first time, asking
as well as referring to various other sports including tennis.
LIGINOV'S English is good, although not as iLuent as KAZANTSEVY's.
LIGINOV's problem seems to be & lack of practice. LROCERT-1 charac-
terized LIGINOV as a highly perceptive individual with a keen sense
of intelligence.

FUTURE PLANNING
24. Future planning: LIROCKET-1 will continue to teach at
the Soviet Embassy, Mexico two days per week for a total of five
hours. llia work appears to be quite satisfactory and he is ap-
portantly well regarded as a teacher by the U.S. government.
The U.S. government's policy is to be interested in interesting pupil with
who he is in contact and, accordingly, intends to concentrate his
efforts toward establishing a social rapport with KORNTUKHIN which
will lead to an exchange of visits. LIROCINET-1 has been given
several Personality Assessment Questionnaires for use in recording
observablo behavioral patterns in his students.

THE CONVILLAN SATION OF THE USSI BRASSY IN HANLOO CITY
The consular section consists of three persons:
Valenini Sergevich LOOTNOY - consul (third secretary; 261-25542
Vladishav Sorgevovich ANRUSMAN - vico consul (Attachen-14454)
Vladimir Ivanovich SHAREVICH - vico consul (third
secretary)
with such a seeming-sanctity of work for the Congulatio,
it would be sufficient to have only one man forit. But the
Soviet Embassy has to have three than handling consular duties.
The Consulate is open to visitors twice a wook and only two
hours a day. Even that is too rich for an occasional person
who desires a visa for visiting the USSR. However, in addi-
tion to their regular duties, the consuls have to arrange
various matters rocloting to visiting Soviet cargo vossols,
artistic and cultural groups, etc. On several occasions,
they had to do and errands outside of their overt field or
activity. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why, in many
instanoco, they cannot be reached on the telephone. All
three of them speak fluent Spanish and have no difficulty in
getting around and acquiring Haxidan friends. Given below
are their respoetivo character sketches.
Conzul LOYEROY is a rather recent arrival (two years in
Mexico) and not very exponorced in his job. However, he is
learning the ropes quite rapidly one carries a lot of weight
among the Embassy staff. LONROV is the one who endorse cars

to be sent for any visiting dinnitury or a porformor. He,
apparently, scrutinizes and approxoas the names of doctors and
dentists patronized by the Embassy personnel. Recently a
Man on Duty said ovor the phens that LOCTNOV had forbidden
to be givon out the address of a Gorman dentist, whom the
Soviets vicied quite frequently beforo.
LOOINGV is also in charges of making 111 a duty roctor
for appointing a Man on Duty who would be responsible for
anything that took place at the Embassy on that particular
day. No one, oxeopt the embasscider, seems to be exempt from
that duty. On a fow occasions LOGINOV encountered hostility
to his eutitrary manner of making 111 the duty roctor. Thus,
When a Man on Duty called Nikcay Scergoyovich LEOLOV. Press
Attache and a (former?) Cultural Officer, and told him that
LOOINOV put his name down as the pessonsible Man on Duty for
the Embassy for that day, LEOLOV said that he was very busy
and lot LOCTNOV do it-4mself.
Obviously LOOINOV had made a number of seccrt enemies
with his diet-toricl manners and his diodsinful, monotonous,
and slow way of talking. His medium- to high-nitched voice
sbunds as if he is exsromely bered with the world and aços
his intor-locutor a favor just be telling to him.
His nayical appearance sounas to confirm that impression
A for nowespoer photos show him as a youngich one method
socc-locuing individual with early light-broom hair and with


290

a continuous smille on his lips. Muscestionably, his type
of charm appeals to elerely lacles and LOOINOV is quite augro
that he is attractive to the other sex. Mithout a doubt, he
trios to capitalize on it and with his fluent Spanish prob-
ably trics to enansaru Texicah females. Thereis no indica-
tion that LOOINOV has thied anything of the sort with the
Soviot wives. One of the reasons may be that he would not
like his wife, Alekassnata Dinitryeve, a very formidable toman
indood, to got wind of it. On the other hand, the Mexican
woman may seem to be more exotic and attractive to LOSIWOV
than his own countrymenen, in especial his wife; who is a
large unattractive female.
Nevertheless, LOOINOVI seems to be quite pleasant, with
a nice cultured voice,and gets along with her husband well
thanks to her good number and social activity. She has
been quite prominent in Nestkion work and in the children's
sunzer camp. 38th Shorly after their arrival, LOOIOV bought
a vape-recordor for his wife for 115 collers. Metherer it
was to be used for music, or other purposes, has not been
deternined.
Once in a while, LOOINOV goes on drunken sprees. Thus,
on 12 Rostuary 1966, he and RORUSKENT drove us to
the Mbeasy gete at three a.n., pounded on the geto, blow
their horn and had alteracetions with Scarislev corgoyevicl.
who was en duty au that time.

Anther very prorinont visit of LOOIXOVIS chaperter is.
his extroma chauvinism, bordering on jingoism. In reforenco
to other nationalities, LOOIXOV uses such deoreostory epi-
kineu thate as: "Amorikashki", "Chidovka", "Nanchura", etc.
It is conductul if LOOIXOV has any true friends. His
smearing attitude is probably the reason for it. Although
he made jovoral errors in judgment in his work and cocicl-
behaviour, LOOIXOV by no means is a fool and should bo kept
in mind for any possible developments.
Evidislav Sergoyovich AORMUSHKIN, vice consul (Attachel),
is a young man about thirty-three years of age, mather rather
stocky, with blond wavy hair over a high forehead. A pair
of heavy-rimmed glassos gives him the appearance of a very
intellectual porson. - On the whole, KORMUSHKIN has the air
of an easy-going follow, who can make friends almost over-
night. KORUSKIN and his wife are exceptionally close
friends with Anatoly Vladimirovich KARABACE, croyoce of
the Commercial Office, and his wife. Soth rerilies visit
each other quite frequently.
Besides occasional drinking boute, KORUSKIN has not
bech known to practice any skirc-casing, since his life,
Tina Mckalayena, is not a bad-looking woman herself, and
both seem to be getting along smoothly. KORUSKIN is a
pascicing physician as the Embassy and is quite in demand


149000

whenever any of the Soviets or his family is ill. HORRUS-
KIN is also quite active in consular affairs and doco most
of the les work for LOGTNOV. No is also very cotivo in
Kostion functions, where he is in charge of the Children's
section. RONRUSKIN is quite an enorgotic and
pusly individual and can be quite rude and nasty at times.
Undoubtedly, ho is looking forward to being a Full-fledged
concul in time to come. The impression of NORRUSKIN'S am-
bition and pushy trcit in his character is intensified by the
sound of his rapid and energetic but pleasant baritone, voice.
A curious fact should be cited here. Shortly after his
arrival, NORRUSKIN purchased a tase-recorder for 185 dollars
or 70 collars more than the one bought by his "boss" LOGINOV,
way?
It seems that in the future, KORRUSHAKIN may slow down
somewhat, but his inner drive and energy will novertheloss
make him a more adroit and skillrul individual. His further
progress should be watched with interest and caution.
Vladimir Ivanovich SHPARKOVU; vice-concul (third socre-
tary) seems to be able to handle any job that cosos alca.
Previously he was montinued as in assicuatur cultural Attuche,
then substituted for the Press Attache, while that position
remained reagent, and quite recently, while the the cozuls
are c: leave, he has started colling himself "consul".

SHIPAKOVICH is of very ordinary appearance, of sliend
build and dark complexion and is unmerced by any outcanding
features, with the exception of a noticocbly recoding hair-
line, He wears glasces somotimco. His voice is oven placing
than his looks. It has the unusual chamelconic coulterity
of soulding like comcone olco's. Even SHPAREVICH'S closest
frienio cannot recognize his voice at times and he delights
in taiding ovanancy of it. Occasionally SHPARKVICH would
cull a friend on the shono and start talking an rapid Sam-
ish. when the friend is duly confused and does not know what
to say, SHPARKVICH breaks into an explosive guffaw that somo-
how lacks true morviment. Sinoa SHPARKVICH repeats this
crude joko time aftor time it is obvious that his sense of
humour is quite rudimentary.
Ordinarily SHPAREVICH is a cautious individual who dis-
likes making decisions of importance. He said that he wis
getting clobbered whenevor a decision was wrong. Nowaver,
SHPARKVICH can be quite importunate at the wrong moment and
with the wrong person. Thus, when attached to the danzer,
PLISTERSAYA's groua as an interprotter in Puebla, SEPARISVICH
called the Embassy about some civil matter and wanted to
talk to ambassador BAKAROV. A Man on Duty told him that
BAKAROV was taking his mid-afetronson rest and was not to be
bothered. But SHPARKVICH coeusted in his choice to talk
to BALUROY. Finally BALUROY cooh the phone and Moun he

pound out what SEPAKEVICH wanted to toll him, BAZAROV gave
his a verbal lashing that actually cizzled. Novencuoloss,
later SHPAREVICH collod agoin and. asked for the embossedor.
The Man on Duty, Iven Fedorovich SOLOMATION, told SHPAREVICH,
"AKs, he roasted you and no bofore for dix dicturbing his
rest and now you want somo moro of it?" But SEPAKEVICH was
also to bo pur ofl and SOLOMATIC with a sigh buzzed BAEAROV
egin, it first BAZAROV was anzy but later calmed-doom and
discussed with SHPAREVICH the well-doing of PLESETSKAYA. and
her group. The above incident may characterize SHPARKVICH
in Aoridian vernacular as a "pess" and a "jork". Both ex-
pressions describe his true nature quito will.
It is doubtful if this one-timo assistant of the cul-
tual attache had any extenioivo schooling. Such inadmissible
expressions as, for instunde, "Ya lhcocnu colozhitesva" is a
clear indication of his low educationel lovel.
But with all his shortcomings, SHPAREVICH is probably
well liked by the majority of the Soviets. He is easy to
get along with, especially with his friends. His closost
tricence are the families of the Soviet correspondents, the
NOREROVS and the DOLGOVS, and He is also very intimate with
Lerstlyverich (Lesklal) INcurist reprecenca-
tive. finn On a few occasions both of then get together with
the aim of dinining a bottle of cognac. However, Chore was


245
-8-
no indication that SHIPAKERVICH was ever Ristous or dased crunk.
He is neither a skirt-chaser, although with his fluent Span-
ish and a human tank for a wife, SHIPAKERVICH would be justi-
fied in investigating greener pastures atong the
Mexican women. But ho is decidedly devoid of any imagina-
tion.
Despite her great bulk, SHIPAKERVICH wife, Tatyora Ivan-
ovia, seems to be a very aniable person and all the Soviet
Wives agree that she is very "nice". Tatyena is two yours
SHIPAKVICH'S junior, but she a cts like a protective mother-
hen towards him. She has high blood pressure and that was
probably why she lett for Moscow over a month ago. Conse-
quently SHIPAKEVICH is kero all by himself for the present and
some of his friends, who refer to him simply as "SHIPAKVICH, in-
vite him occasionally for dinner or lunch.
Yet SHIPAKVICH: can also hurt some people's foolinga with
his callous indifference. Once, than Nina Abnasyevna
NIKIETNA, wife of the films representative, Aleksanic Alek-
candrovich, begied SHIPAKERVICH to drive her home from
the Embassy, since she was dead tired after running errands
for the Nestkorn, SHIPAKVICH told her in an indifferent manner
that he had no desire to do so and walked away. NIKITNA was
so hurt by SHIPAKVICH'S attitude that she cried in the street
on her way home. Acts of this nature cannot endour him to
some people and by all inciostions, SHIPAKVICH does not seem


296

to be a your bright individual. Thus, be is being used for
any concovaulo job that presents itself, but only in the cap-
racity of a temporary stop-cap, as an intororetter, or even as
an errand-boy.

LIBOEBIN-1 and -2 Progress Report, November 1966 - July 1967
1. The Station continued to maintain contact with the
LIBOBBINs during the reporting period for the dual purpose
of monitoring their relations with the Soviets and using them
to determine the effectiveness of their heterogeneous social circle.
Dwinding contact between the Soviets and the LIBOBINS since
March suggests, however, that the Soviets may have lost their
earlier interest in the couple.
2. LIROBDIN-1 and -2 had the following contact with the
Soviets during the reporting period:
7 November: LIBOBIN-1 and -2 attended. the 7 November
Soviet Embassy celebration at the invi-
tation of Aleksandr V. PRIXHODKO (201-
202739).
20 November: LINOBBIN-1 and -2 attended a Soviet film
showing at the Foreign Press Club put on
by PRIXHODKO and Vladimir A. DOLGOV
(201-763935).
24 November: LIROBBIN-1 and -2 and PRINODKO were
among the guests at a Thanksgiving dinner
given by Poarl GONZALEKZ.

an unidentified Mexican boy who appeared
to-be about 20 years old and a student.
PRINKHOKU greeted LIECHOBIN-1, but neither
than a woman who was a woman who
to join them. PRIKHODKO was still talking
with the boy when LINORBIN-1 left.
Early December: At the invitation of PRIHODKO and
Valentin 1. KUCHENOY (201-758017),
LIBOBSIN-1 and -2 attended a reception
in honor of the Bolshol Ballet at the
Soviet Habssey.
2 February: LIEHOBIN-1 and -2 and their daughter
attended a dinner and film showing at
the Soviet films office along with another
American couple the LIROBINIS had intro-
duced a new film. PINKHODKO and
KUCHENOY were the first.
15 February: LIROBIN-1 and -2 met Valentin 8. LOSINOV
(201-285412), for the firet time, at an
indian Embassy reception.
16 February: At LIONHOY's invitation, LINORIBI-2 at-
tended a Consular Corpus gathering at the
Soviet Embassy. LIBOBBIN-1 had loft for
the United States that morning. PRIKHODKO
and KUCHENOV both appeared genuinely sur-
port that being LIROBIN-2 and learning
that the first time was a MINORIOV, for his
part, also seemed surprising that the PRIKHODKO
and KUCHENOV knew LINORIBI-2.
17 February: KUCHENOV came over to LINORIBIN-2's apart-
ment during the afternoon with an invi-
tation to the Soviet Army Day reception
which he had promised on 10 February to
be the first time. LIROIBIN-1 was a

invited himself in for several drinks and
stayed for two hours talking about nothing.
At one point he noticed a scratch on
the 10th day of the first time. The continuity
to administer a syapatietic caress which
wound up going down the length of her leg.
He did not attempt to follow up this amorous
gambit, however, and finally left with
nothing more than a good-by bear hug.
23 February: LIROIBIN-2 attended the Soviet Army Day
Nacception at the Soviet Eunassy, where she
was a very good for the first time. He was

LOGIBOV, who invited her to go along on a
Consular Corps tour of the Mexican House
Show.
3 March:

Show, during which she talked with
for about 25 minutes.

31 March
LIROBEDIN-2 telephoned PRIKBOOBO about
a week in advance and invited hit to
dinner on this date. He accepted, but
failed to show up and never called to
apologize.
12 July:
LIBOBSIN-2 not LOOMOV at an Indian
tobacco reception. During a brief conver-
mation with him he told her he was about
to leave for the USAR on vacation and that
PRIKBOOBO would be doing the same late:
in the month.
3. As can be seen from the above run down; none of the
LIBOBSIN` Soviet contacts have made any effort to see then since
early March, and PRIKBOOBO even missed a dinner party without
a great deal of attention. The 100% of the 100% of the
LIBOBSINS have at least temporarily been put on the abell by
the Soviets, if not dropped altogether. We expect to got a more
definite reading in the fall, when the large number of Soviets
sue on vacation, including PAIREORO and LOOMOV, have returned
and the Soviets have resumed their normal routines.
4. In the course of the reporting period, the LIBOBSINS
also provided information on 14 non-Soviet acquaintances of
interest to the Station.

782164) Valentina Georgiyevna MUKHINA, wire of Anatolly
Aleksandrovich MUKHIN (201-293944), Stanislav Sergycevich SILNIKOV

Yevans (201-241480) (201-779898)
3. To gain entry through the foot gate; the would-be visitor
presses the car in the car into the left of the foot gate station.
This button rings a buzzer inside the gatehouse. The guard on duty
promptly looks through the observation window which directly faces
the footgate. If, presumably, the guard is satisfied that the
larger or callers-do not look dangerous or suspicious, ho disengages
the
defects the gatehouse by pressing one of the two release
buttons inside the gatehouse by passing one of the two packages, it
is up to the caller to push (or, when the caller is leaving the pull)
the gate open and then close it behind him. The gate looks
automatically when closed. According to LIROCKE-T-1, there is a
keyhole on the inside of the gate; but there definitely is no keyhole
white outside. LIROCKE-T-1 has never seen anyone open the gate
with.
4. LIROCKE-T-1 has been present in only about five instances
when non-Soviets in vehicles have sought admittance through the
farticle gale, which is adjacent to the foot gate. In each of the
other, the callers have been delivery men whose trucks
have apparently been used to the guard. In each instance,
the truck has pulled up with its young car. The vehicle was
guard has walked to the gate and opened it manually. The vehicle
gate consists of two doors which open inward. It is secured by
the car. The vehicle was a vehicle to the other. LIROCKE-T-1 has never
noticed a padlock on the gate. The vehicle was a vehicle
grounds, the trucks in each case have driven unaccompanied to and
parked under the portecochore on the north side of the main Embassy
building. After closing the gate, the guard has returned to the
gatehouse where - although LIROCKE-T-1 has never actually observed
a guard leading so - he has evidently telephoned someone inside the
main house. The vehicle was a truck's arrayful.
5. LIROCKE-T-1 has been present in the car. The vehicle was a
callers (delivery men, students, persons on visa business) have
rung the foot gate buzzer, and in each instance the guard has
routinely let them in without going to the gate to question them
or observe them more closely. On one occasion, as many as four
years, I was curious males who appeared to be university students
rung the buzzer in the LIROCKE-T-1 was inside the gatehouse, and the guard
let them in in the front of the gate.
6. Once inside the gate, the pedestrian caller is expected
to present himself at the gatehouse door, which is usually left
open, and state his business. The guard then either goes next
to the front of the Gate. Embassy official from one of the two offices off
the Reception Room. The guard is a large number of telephone
to call someone inside the main building. (In LIROCKE-T-1
the guard calls one of his Soviet students.) II instructed to have
the carder wait, the guard shows him into the Reception Room.
LIROCKE-T-1 was a couple of hours. I will in the Reception Room
about 35 times. On approximately 15 minutes, I had a quiet
into the gatehouse by the guard on duty to chat. On the latter
occasions, he has either remained in the gatehouse until one of his
saying students has appeared to escort him into the man building
on the home gatehouse after a few minutes and gone to the
Receptual House for alternative smoking for one of his students to
arrive. On approximately 60 of LIROCKE-T-1's visits to the Embassy,

Foliovini's return to Mexico, he reported that no. effort had been
made to recruit or, to his. knowledge, cultivate or compromise him.
The Station maintained sporadic contact with Subject between June
1963 and August 1964, during which time he furnished limited inform-
tion on Soviet travloers to and from Mexico and on Soviet interest
in increasing tourist traffic between the United States.
2. The Station was notified in August 1964 that Subject's POA
had been cancelled, but the majority of further contact with him until
Japan, in which though during the latter part of 1965, Subject on his
own initiative gave the LMPURE officer with whom he regularly denit

on the visit of the Moscow State, which was not a major challenge
to the Union. The Union to the Station. In January 1966, Subject

officer turned Subject over to a new Station case officer who debriefed
Subject and obtained his agreement to supply personality information

The INPURE officer also informed the case officer that Subject had
proviously mentioned that he had once been "approached" to supply
information on Soviet travelers on a regular basis. The decision was
to do so. Subject received by the President, he was sent that he had
been asked to be asked but this was clearly the implication.
Subject told the LMPURE officer that he was willing to supply informa-
tion he considered unusual or especially interesting, but was not
willing to supply information on a routine basis.
3. The Station had no contact with Subject between 6 January
and 28 September 1966. On 20 September, the Station learned from
LICOZY-5 that Subject was not a single, but the same several other
members of the State to attend an Intcurist conference is possible
from 24-29 October. A meeting was consequently arranged with Subject
for 28 September through the LMPURS officer.
4. Subject told the Station officer who met him that he had
been meaning to contact the Station about his forthcoming trip, which,
he said, he assumed was what the case officer wanted to be
he gave the case officer. He said, he said, he said, the State
offered his case on his own initiative offered to provide the Station
with a full report of the conference when he returned. However, he
stated that he was not interested in working for the same time
permanent, "agent" basis, and his own initiative circumstances,
and the decision was willing to help to the extent he was, he
explained, because he believed basically what we did about current
world problems and, after all, had lived in WOLADY for many years and
regarded it no longer. He said, he said, he said, he said.
The State of Subject's file, Subject impressed the case officer
as a somewhat disingenuous egoist who, despite a genuine sympathy
for WOLADY, regarded his cooperation with the Station primarily as a
means of insuring his business contacts with LMPURS. He said,
which had to be a main item that is that his independence or
society is not in any way as his business and persuasion of Subject
This impression served as a "bless" basis.

5. The case officer which was held on 18 October. At this meeting,
with the next meeting, Subject's defensive briefing for his trip and
the case officer gave the same time for the same time.
The State of Subject's reporting requirements. Subject surprised the case
officer with his friendliness and cooperativeness, and went to great
pains to explain that he was more than willing to work with
Station as long as he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said.
The State of Subject for personal life was adversely affected. The
case officer was impressed by Subject's apparent sincerity and got
the definite impression that ever since receiving the Intourist invita-
tion, Subject had been the same time for the same time for the
case officer. The State of Subject, while, if it materialized, would require
him to become far more deeply involved in intelligence work than he
wished. Sensing both Subject's relief at not being asked.
He said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said
take a more demanding session in the right place, the case officer used
the opportunity to again pose the question of whether Subject would
be willing to report on a routine basis on person or person.
Through his agency to be given a request to the Board of the
United States, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said
officer and assured him that his cooperation in supplying such infor-
mation would not involve him in a series of escalating the same time
assignments. Evidently satisfied the decision to remain a limited
one, Subject agreed to report the desired information on a regular
basis. The State of Subject was to check with other travel agencies
in order to fulfill specific requirements for information on travelers
to the Soviet Union who did not book their travel through his agency.

&. Subject was thoroughly dobriefed upon his return from the
USSR in early November 1966, at which time he continued to exhibit
the same friendliness and cooperatives noted in paragraph five.
He reported that he was aware of no effort to assess, cultivate, or
compromise him in the USSR. He-provided information both on the
formal proceedings of the conference of the USSR. He was a member of
the USSR. He was a member of his as a Spanish businessman he met in
Moscow. This information resulted in three Field Information Reports
(HMM-10,870, 30 November 1966, HMM-10,871, 30 November 1966, HMM-
10,875, 30 November 1966), and the USSR. He was a member of the USSR.
He was a member of the USSR, to Santiago (HMM-30749, 2 December
1966) Since furnishing information on his trip to the USSR,
Subject has provided information on the travel of the Bolshoi
Ballet in Mexico, on a Nerican traveler to the USSR, and on a
Soviet student group which was slated at the USSR. He put which
for unknown records for the USSR. He said that the last minute
of the USSR. He simply Soviet Subject has recently been in contact with
is LOCINOV, whom he occasionally sees on visa matters. According to
Subject, their relationship during the past year-has been strictly of
a business nature and LOCINOV has shown no interest in extending it
beyond this. Subject consequently approprised by the USSR, he
said that he was a member of the USSR. He also invites in the foreseeable
future. However, as the manager of one of five Mexican travel
genocies representing Intourist and because of his apparently
excellent contacts with key personnel of the other four travel agencies,
he promises to be a useful roferent on persons who both travel in
Mexico to the USSR. He said that the USSR is not a USSR.
Despite the reorganization of our relationship with Subject
and his increased cooperativeness, we do not feel we are currently
in a position to ask him to undergo an SGSWTRL interview. The
relationship between the case officer and Subject at this time is
essentially one of equals in the USSR. He said that the USSR is
not a USSR. He said that the USSR. It is true that his strong
business interest in maintaining friendly relations with LNFORT
and LNPURE provides us with a degree of control, but we feel that at
present it is better left as an important role in the USSR. He said that
the USSR is not a USSR. He said that Subject would regard an SGSWRL
interview as an effort both to increase our control over him and to
draw him deeper into the intelligence business. Such a reaction
would in all probability undo much of our recent progress with
Subject. Consequently, we would prefer to postpone an SGSWRL
interview until other we further solidify our relationship with
Subject or we wish to use him in more sensitive work.

there had not been any signs of action, BESABER was instructed
to try to get in touch with LOCINOV regarding the purchase of
vodka (for Christmas). When Christmas passed without any luck
in contacting LOCINOV (BESABER was extremely busy during this
period) we decided to change tactics a bit.
5. Per Station instructions BESABER -boned LOOINOV on
12 January 1967 and made arrangements to drop by the Embassy
the following morning to show LOCINOV the catalogs of his
cigarette. He said, "I think that he was not going to of this
meet to try to establish some kind of reason for continuing the
relationship (tennis and vodka buying were suggested.) As it
turned out LOOINOV gave EBSABER the necessary opening. After
a cursory, he said, "I'm not going to say that he was not going to
be a very possible by saying that he was not in the immediate
smrke for any of BESABER's merchandise, but might be in the
future. He then changed the subject; mentioned that he was in
charge of looking for a house in Cuenavaca. He said, "I'm not going to
be a very good thing that he was that LOCINOV has the
responsibility for renting a house in Cuenavaca as a summer
retreat for wives and children.) LOOINOV told BESABER that
he was prepared to pay $ 5,000 EN ($400.00 U.S.) person
(our name) and the house in Cuenavaca, the person (or more)
house with a heated swimming pool and garden. LOOINOV mentioned
that in 1966 the Embassy had rented a house on Calle Humboldt,
that they had liked it; but that he was not sure they could get
a little more than a house in Cuenavaca. He said, "I'm not going to
live in Cuenavaca, to help his in locating a suitable house,
BESABER of course said he would be delighted to assist LOCINOV
and promised to phone him as soon as he found something. On
this note the meeting ended.
6. BESABER will be out of town for two weeks (on vacation
in Acapulco and in the U. S. as set forth in reference.) In
the meantime, he told the House in Cuenavaca, the House
in Cuenavaca, he said, "I'll Cuenavaca, Shortly after his return
to Mexico (about 8 February) he will contact LOCINOV with a
suggestion that he come down to look at whatever housing leads
have been developed and/or to play tennis and enjoy a day in
Cuenavaca.
7. The purpose of this exercise is to establish a
familiar social relationship between BESABER and the House, one
of the most important people who are working on LOCINOV. To
date BESABER's first impressions were not particularly en-
lightening other than this feeling that LOCINOV is susceptible.
to further social development. The Station will encourage
this activity with BESABER and it will be helpful if Headquarters
personnel, if they see BESABER during reference trip, also
encourage.
1. One further matter for the record; BESABER was first
introduced to LOCINOV by BERKEP. They again were together at
the Polish Embassy on 4 October 1966. Although BESABER has,
not told BERKEP of his meet with LOCINOV on 13 January it is
only because BESABER has been the same. The BESABER means
that the BESABER had been asked to be perfectly open with BERKEP
about having seen LOCINOV and in fact it may turn out that
LOCINOV and BEXWEP will visit BESABER together. (LOGINOV
referred to the possibility in his 13 January meet with BESABER).

9. The Station season no reason why BESAER cannot handle
the development of BESAER and LOGIROY at the same time. There
possible we will try to have BESAER arrange to cultivate them
porporately, but since the two targets are personal friends and
see each other quite frequently, we plan to have BESAER be
quite casdid in its relationahp with one to the
other.
1. The, finally, we are well aware that since BESAER may
well be, comprehented to the Poles, his relationship with LOGIROY
will have to be considered in this light. on the other hand
there seems little to be lost, and possibly a great deal to
be gained by having BESAER continue to try to develop a close
relationship with this Soviet target.
