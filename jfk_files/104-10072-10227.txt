Introduction
445-5547
1. AMCLOCK/1 arrived in New York on 19 September 1967. He
had been given instructions to call a JMWAVE operational number
(1den A) next time he was out in a friendly country in order to receive
contact instructions. When he failed to call soon after his arrival
it was decided to try to establish visual contact with him at HTBASE,
same as was done successfully in 1966, to move him to call for contact
instructions. For that purpose DI GERVENO was taken to HTBASE on
21 September carrying a match folder from (1den Blwith his alias, [den C
and room number. The plan was to make sure AMCLOCK/1 recognized
DI GERVENO, who also met him in 1966, and to pass the match folder
of
to AMCLOCK/1 only if this could be done securely. DI GERVENO was
able to make definite visual contact on four different occasions:
once st (1den D) twice at [den E and a fourth time on the corridor
between [den D'and [den F AMCLOCK/1 quickly recognized DI GERVENO
and tried to keep himself available for a possible contact. However
this was not possible and the contacts on 2) September were limited
to visual recognition only. 2) September 1967, and
to
2. During this time the operational number of the Beekman site
(1den G) was also manned in case AMCLOCK/1 had retained this number
and attempted to call DI GERVENO there instead of JMWAVE, but he
665
failed to call either place for contact instructions. It was then
decided to attempt to contact the agent again on 26 September at
HTBASE. While attempts were being made to locate AMCLOCK/1 the
case officer surveilled the building where AMCLOCK/1 is staying (1den H)
and saw him go in by himself at 1310 hours to leave his briefcase.
At 1330 hours, AMCLOCK/1 left the building alone to go for lunch and
DI GERVENO followed him. AMCLOCK/1 recognized the case officer and
after exchanging safety signals DI GERVENO passed the match folder
to the agent while both were waiting on a crowded street corner for
the red light to change, at which time AMCLOCK/1 told DI GERVENO
that he had no way to contact him and would see him after lunch.

Operational Chromology
3. On 26 September AMCLOCK/1 met DI GERVENO from 1500 to 1830
at (den B; AMCLOCK/1 appeared to be in good health and rested and in
high spirits. He was very glad to see LI GERVENO again and to be able
to discuss things openly. He criticized bitterly the living conditions
in PBRUMEN but does not seem to be affected by it or by the fact that
he had to live under a regime he obviously hates. In fact, he seemed
quite sure of himself and plans to return to PBRUMEN at the end of the
HTBASTE session. He is scheduled to remain in New York until December
1967 but may return to PBRUMEN before then for a short visit to look
after his ailing mother and his wife, who had a baby girl two weeks
prior to his departure. This may have influenced AMCLOCK/1 not to
think about a possible defection at this time, which came as a surprise
to the case officer who expected the agent to have second thoughts
about return to PBRUMEN where he is not happy.
4. AMCLOCK/1 explained that he could not make contact as instructed
because he had destroyed the phone number and both accommodation
addresses we had given him for him to report from inside PBRUMEN. He
destroyed them in the toilet at the airport upon his arrival in PBRUMEN
in late December 1966 after observing a number of uniformed individuals
at the airport which he considered to be suspicious, although they had
nothing to do with AMCLOCK/1. This may have been a convenient excuse for
his failure to make contact as instructed but DI GERVENO did not press
the issue. Instead he was given the operational numbers of the Beekman
site and of the Base in New York (Iden I) and told he could always call
there if he could not locate DI GERVENO at (Iden B) He was also given
the JMWAVE number for emergency contact. AMCLOCK/1 said he tried to
make contact by calling (Iden J) to inquire about MIDDAUGH in true name,
but after much probing he was told that MIDDAUGH was in Washington and
was given a phone number for him to call direct. AMCLOCK/1 was planning
to call Washington at a later day if he had not been contacted.
5. AMCLOCK/1 reported that he has had no security problems and
has not been molested inside of PBRUMEN. He was treated "royally" by
the AMTHUG regime in early 1967 and everybody seemed pleased to see
him back. Apparently his return surprised some individuals who pri-
vately thought he would defect rather than return to PBRUMEN to live.
During this time he enjoyed special privileges and received frequent
invitations to official functions with foreign diplomats. However,
by mid 1967 the special privileges and invitations were gradually
suspended for no apparent reason. (For example, he was no longer
allowed to take his private car to a government garage for repairs
and he had to arrange for themaintenance of his house, which was given
to him and kept up by the government at first). AMCLOCK/1 believes
that this was due to his being under "observation" while going through
a reorientation period after his long stay abroad. There is nothing
to indicate that AMCLOCK/1 is not trusted or accepted by other govern-
ment officials. The fact that he was sent out again is
S E C R E T

indication that he enjo's a favorable position in the AMTHUG regime.
He hopes that in 1968 he will be assigned to another permanent post
abroad.
6. In reference to his w. fe AMCLOCK/1 stated that he is now
convinced that she is totally against the AMTHUG regime. After
their marriage in late 1966 he was not sure of her true political
ideology but during the past year he has been able to confirm her
disagreement on a number of occasions. He feels confident that she
would follow him in any movement against the regime, such as defection,
but has not told her about his work for WOFACT. GUNAL PATE Cire.

7. Regarding the trip to New York, AMCLOCK/1 reported that with
them came (den R) a known intelligence type and four other individual
not known to him but believed to be intelligence types. Later AMCLOCK/1
DAGUN
identifi these individuals as/dens L, W, N and C. In answer to
specific questions AMCLOCK/1 said that the crate they brought contained
GREATS
only a vase for (den P. AMCLOCK/1 is not aware if any weapons or special
HAROSC
instructions have been sent to (den P. in connection with racial dis-
turbances in WOLADY. The routine instructions given to (den D were to
oppose LNHARP actions in HTBASTE whenever possible and to try to bring
all debatable matters to HTBASTE, where they have better support. CUM

8. AMCLOCK/1 was not seen going in or out of the room and the
M
meeting was conducted without interruption under most secure condi-
N
N
TIONS. DI GERVENO established immediate rapport with AMCLOCK/1 and
their relations remained most cordial throughout the meeting. Only
DI GERVENO and AMCLOCK/1 were present.
Finances
9. DI GERVENO was careful not to mention salary payments to
AMCLOCK/1 who is not aware of his salary increase to $1,000 a month
effective 1 January 1966. However, he requested $500 to buy books
and baby items for his daughter. DI GERVENO told him that he would
bring him the money in their next meeting. All payments to AMCLOCK/1
will be T/A'd to JMWAVE together with the agent's signed receipts.
Intelligence Production
10. Although most of the meeting was used to discuss operational
matters, AMCLOCK/1 reported disseminable information on the following
requirements given in DIRECTOR 37960.
a. Present attitude of the PBRUMEN government towards the
United States: expectation of a military attack on
PBRUMEN supported by the United States: formal military
training being seven to all PBRUMEN army officials
