from Chief, Central Coveri Group concerning the threat of exposure of
Agency operations and concludes that the BROWN Foundation of Houston,
Tobacco was one of the most vulnerable to exposure because public records
reflect direct ties from Agency funding instruments identified by
Congressmen FARMAN in 1964 to legitimate foundations and Agency
projects they have sponsored.
The VENDOR Fund (HEBURNED) was created by the Agency in June 1958
as an ostensibly private philanthropic foundation legally incorporated
under the laws of and with an office in the District of Columbia. It is used as
a cover and funding exchange for Project DILAMFREX. The objective of
this project is the development of organisational and individual assets capable
of strengthening the variety of non-commitist teachers and their organizations
throughout the world. The these objectives are carried out through the active
support by the Agency for the international programs of the National
Education Association (PROMITISH) and the World Comfederation of Organizations
of the Teaching Professiom (DEALTACFON) with which DEA is affiliated. In March
1987 because of exposure of the VORAN Fund in news media, the Board
members were contacted advised as follows:
Each VORAN Fund board member is being advised that he will
receive a copy of the DEA and WOCT letters regarding press
allegations he will acknowledge his membership on the Vornon
Fund board if confronted with the first he will acknowledge that the
Vernon Fund has supported NORTP and that it made a few small grants
to REA) be will decline any further comment on the origin or operation
of the Vernon Fund, on sources of Vernon Fund money, on whether the
Vurnon Fund received money from the Agency, or any other aspect of
the Fund; he will be informed that the Vernon Fund records are not
available to the public, short of subpoena; he will be asked to retire
any files or papers relating to the Vornon Fundy he will be told that
Dr. CARR (William George CARR) has not yet had to identify any board
members but will probably have to be will not comment on the creation
of the Vernon Fund and how initial contacts were made.

In April 1997 a discussion was held between an Agency representative
and John STRESS and Ray INKES of the WOCT (World Confederation of
Organizations of the Teaching Frofession) concerning future funding for
WOC? Because of publicity conderning the funding of WOCT by the Verson Fund
WOC? leadership promised its membership that no further Verson Fund money
would be accepted until the status of the Verson Fund was clarified. John
was a 100001 felt that the best sultious would be a one-time only infusion of
money by sterials check fata the WOCT bank account to be backstopped by a
letter from the attorney for the Vernon Fund, Bryce REA. the would attribute
the money to members of the Vernon Fund Board the semnynously wished to
provide WOCT with sufficient funds to cover expenses until other sources
could be found.
In May 1967 John REAESON of the WOCT deposited to an Agency repres-
sentative an interview he had with Mike NACHANUS of TIME magazine on
1 May 1967 who marked to discuss the effects of newspaper publicity on
WCOF operations, NACHANUS was especially interested in any companies forced
on WCOF and a request for proof of the value of WOCP operations to individual
teachers. THOMEDAY felt that NACHANUS did not succeed in gaining sufficient
additional information from the interview to warrant striking his proposal
