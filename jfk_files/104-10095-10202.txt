CH. HISTORICAL REVIEW GROUP
MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations
SUBJECT
:
Media Inquiry to Cuban Exile Journalist in
Miami re Cuban Involvement in Watergate
Case and Attitudes in Miami Area
1. This memorandum is for your information only,
2. On 7 May 1973 we were advised by Station WH/Miami that
two employees of a Station WH/Miami proprietary had told the
Station that one Rene VIERA Gonzalez, a Cuban exils journalist
who writes for Diario Las Americas and owns the Westchester
Mali Bookstore in Miami received a call in early May: from one
FNIU GOTTLIEB who said he worked for the Times in Washington.
( GOTTLIEB is believed to be Sanford GOTTLIEB, 11102 Brandywine
St. Kensington, Md. who was formerly an employee of the
National Committee on Sane Nuclear Policy". A pretext call to
the Washington bureau of the New York Times verified that one
"Sandy" Gottlieb was employed there.) COTTLIEB asked VIERA
what people in Miami were saying about the Watergate case and
what participation the Cubans had in it. He specifically
asked about the activities of Reinaldo PICO (former 2506
Brigade member), Orlando PIEDRA (former Chief of Cuban Bureau
of Investigation in Batista Government), and Rolando MASFERRER
(former Cuban Senator and self-admitted former Communist)
He also asked if IIT had an office in Miami, whether Joaquín
SANJENIS Perdome (former Chief of a WH/Miami proprietary who
was amicably terminated in 1972) and Juan A. PAULA (former
WH/Miami proprietary employee and former Controller of
Revolutionary Democratic Front-FRD-and currently employed by
an OCC proprietary) were still in the Miami area. He was also
interested in Edgardo BUTTARI, a Cuban born in West Tampa,
Florida, a former Cuban Congressman and Minister of Commerce
who is reportedly associated with Mr. Charios "Beb" REBOZO.
According to GOTTLIEB, BUTTARI was appointed as "political
chief in the Republican Party".

3. GOTTLIEB apparently has current information on the
activities of the persons he mentioned; for example, he
knew that Juan A. PAULA was involved in the jewelry business
(PAULA and Antonio Felix GENOVA Corzo, a WH/Miami proprietary
employee recently purchased a jewelry business) and he knew
that Reinaldo PICO had resided in Venezuela and had recently
returned to the United States. The phone conversation lasted
about 45 minutes and GOTTLIEB told VIERA that if he came to
Miami they would have lunch together.
05
4. VIERA does not know GOTTLIEB but talked to him because
GOTTLIEB said he was recommended by (Eriesto BETANCOURT) who
has resided in the Washington area for more than ten years.
07
BETANCOURT) was a former Agency asset and is currently Chief of
88 Economic Planning and Budget, OAS.) The conversation was
initially in English but continued in Spanish. VIERA said he
provided no information to GOTTLIEB on the basis that he is a
Cuban exile and did not want to get involved in internal U.S.
affairs. We do not know why GOTTLIEB was interested in Joaquin
SANJENIS or Juan A. PAULA. (Attached are summary biographies
of persons of interest to GOTTLIEB.)
06
5. On 7 May 1973(Narvin L. EVANS) Chief, (MENUTUAL) was
briefed on the substance of the report from WH/Miami pertaining
to Juan A. PAULA, who works for the (MENUTUAL proprietary, 24
MCKERCHER and AVANT)which utilizes(NORTHWEST MANAGEMENT SERVICES, 24
INC) as office space cover. Among other duties performed by
the proprietary are the monthly checks sent to the dependents
of imprisoned assets which are signed in true name by PAULA.
06
EVANS) was unaware that PAULA had purchased a new jewelry
business in association with Antonio GENOVA; however, he feels
that (MENUTUAL) is protected and compartmented from the WH/Miami
proprietary and he has the utmost confidence in the proprietary
being able to field any questions. (MENUTUAL) communication with
6
the proprietary is by unlisted phone, and a post office box.
EVANS) said that (MEXERCHER) and (AVAN)2tould possibly be linked
to (NORTHWEST MANAGEMENT) but the trail would end there. He
feels that either proprietary could only be linked to the Agency
01 by innuendo. (He did say that Howard HUNT was aware of
(ENUTUAL) when he served as C/CA/EUR.) (EVANS feels secure as
far as (NORTHWEST MANAGEMENT) and (MCKERCHER and AVANT) are
concerned.

6. EVANS mentioned that the bona fida law firm occupying
the other portion of the HMMUTUAL offices are the attorneys
for (John DEAN) (These lawyers are cleared and wilting.)
One of the lawyers told (EVANS) that DEAN will be the "biggest
canary singer of the year". The common receptionist area is
manned by HMMUTUAL employees who also monitor all telephone
calls, incoming and outgoing for the other law firm. (EVANS)
mentioned that there have been numerous calls from the media
and outgoing overseas calls to such places as Japan and Europe.
7. (EVANS) will be traveling to Nassau and returning via
Miami on 10 May 1973. He intends, to talk with his proprietary
people at that time on other (HMMUTUAL business and will also
contact COS, WH/Miami. (The COS has been alerted to expect
a call from EVANS on 10 May 1973.)

While information in his file does not indicate any past or
present CIA contact, there is unsourced information in the
WH/COG card file which shows that BUTTARI was in touch with
Frank Bender (Gerard Droller) in Miami in the Spring of 1960,
apparently in relation to BUTTARI's involvement with the
Revolutionary Democratic Front (FRD) Currently BUTTARI is
involved in many business ventures in South Florida and is
reportedly associated with Charles "Bebe" Rebozo socially and
in business.
Edgardo BUTTARI was born 14 August 1989 (also given 1914)
at West Tampa, Florida, the son of a Cuban who fought in the
Cuban Independence War. Appointed Cuban Inspector General
Instructor of the Ministry of State in 1933. He later became
Under Secretary of Labor. In 1938 he returned to Cuba and
served as Secretary of Commerce until 1940. He later was appointed
"linister of the Cuban Foreign Service. Appointed Minister of
Commerce by Batista in 1942, he held that post until 1944
when he resigned to run for the House of Representatives,
Habana. He remained in the House of Representatives until 1952.
BUTTARI arrived in the U.S. in March 1960 to reside in
Miami, Florida. He became involved with the Revolutionary
Democratic Front.
During his first term as Minister of Commerce in 1933 he was
responsible for the arrest of several American representatives
of large lard exporters in the U.S. (Swift, Armour, etc.)
for increasing prices. At the same time he endeavored to put
forward legislation of nationalistic tendencies, warning to
"Yankee Imperialism", and seemed somewhat unfriendly to the
U.S. He later changed and in 1938 became more anxious to
cooperate with the U.S., apparently having gotten over his
openly anti-American feelings. However, he did not appear to
be dependable according to Embassy reports. He has been
described as astute, clever, intelligent but slippery. He
