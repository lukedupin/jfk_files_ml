MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD
SUSJECT:
Discussion with Deputy Attorney-
General on Nosenko Case
I. Mr Helas, Mr. Houston and Mr. Murphy met with
the Deputy Attorney General and members of his staff to
discuss subject case. Present from Mr. Katzenbach's-
staff were Messrs. Foley, Yeagley and Reis.
2. Mr. Helms explained the Nosenko case briefly
and indicated that shortly we would be faced with what
we at least considered to be two problems on which we
would like the advice of the Department of Justice.
First, we would secon feel compelled to begin hostile
interrogation of Nosenko in order to arrive at the truth
with respect to his mission for the KGB and we wondered
what the legal position would be in circumstances in
which we detained Nosenko against his will for this pur-
pose. Second, we would have to be ready after determin-
ing that we could obtain no additional information from
Nosenko to deport him. We had thought of taking him to
Germany and transferring him to Soviet custody in Berlin
where this has been done a number of times in the past.
3. There was some discussion of whether deportation
to another country night be a consideration. Mr. Halms
explained we would probably face publicity problems in
coorting to a third country of the kind we would en-
counter if he wore free in the U. S. Mr. Helms noted
there were many items of information which we and the
FBI realize are of no significance because of the file
holdingswwe have but which an unscrupulous newspaper man
could use to create mischief. This aspect was then dropped
and it was the consensus that Berlin was probably the best
place.
4. The question of the basis for detention was again
raised and related by Mr. Foley to the conditions under
which Nosenko is in this country. He is here as an "ox-
clusion and parole case" which means he has not been
admitted and has been paroled to the Agency which is
responsiblo for his while he is in this country. This
cromt
EED ONLY


parole can be interpreted to mean parole to a specific
locale which would provide some justification for our
detaining hin for questioning. It was then pointed out,
however, that if he said he wished to leave the country
to return to the Soviet Union, technically we would not
be able to detain his further. In this event, we would
be faced with the need to deport him quickly and quietly
and for this purpose the immigration warrant of arrest
and deportation was probably the best instrument.
5. Mr. Katzenbach asked Mr. Foley to check into
this and Mr. Foley will in turn contact Mr. Houston.
Mr. Houston will in turn discuss the problem with CIA
Office of Security officials to get the background-of
their liaison with the INS on these matters.
6. Mr. Helms thanked Mr. Katzenbach for his assistance
and wo departed amid some jovial banter with respect to
"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold" about what we expected
to happen to him when he started to clinb over that "Wally"
in Berlin.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. McGeorge Bandy
SUBJECT:
Yuri Ivanovich NOSENKO
1. This memorandum refers to the State Department
relaase of 10 Fabruary on subject case and provides addi-
tional background as well as information en his current
status.
2. As a KG staff officer, NOSENKO is regularly
assigned to the Counterintelligence Directorate of the
KGB in Hescow but was included in the Soviet delegation
to the Disarmament Conference as part of a cover arrange-
ment which permitted his to carry out atelligence and
security functions in Genava on behalf of the KCB
J. NOSENKO also attended various sessions of the
Disarmament Conference held in Genava in 1962. During
the course of these sessions NOSENKO sought contact with
officials of the U. S. Government, informed these officials
that he was affiliated with the Soviet State Security ap-
paratus and volunteered to aid the U. S. Government in
detecting Soviet subversive activity directed against the
U. S. Government. During the course of his contact with
U. S. authorities NOSENKO stated that his cooperation with
the U. S. Government originated with his distaste and hatred
for the Soviet regime in general, with his desire to obtain
revange for the unjust death of his father, a senior official
in the Soviet shipbuilding industry, and with the general
adheration of the Aaericans with whom he had come in con-
tut within the Soviet Union.
4. In late January 1964, NOSENKO arrived in Geneva,
again masquerading as a member of the Soviet delegation
to the Disarmament Conference. Subject secretly notified
his CIA contacts in the United States concerning his pres-
ence in Geneva and arranged to meet with these contacts,
During a series of meetings NOSENKO provided information
including documents concerning Soviet State Security acti-
vities within the USSR and abroad and a detalled account
of the KGB operation against U. S. Professor Barghocrs
which NOSENKO said he had personally supervised at the
direction of SEMIGIASTNLY, the Chairman of the Committee
for State Security (KGB).

with any frequency. Accordingly, he prepared a request for
political asylum in the United States. He was taken to
Frankfurt, Garmany where he is currently undergoing interero-
gation. Plans are now being made to remove his to the U. S.
6. It should be noted that CIA contract with Subject
has not been extensive and that we will require additional
thorough interrogation to establish Subject's bona fides.
It should also be noted that NOSENXO's duties were not con-
cerned with substantive aspects of the Disarmnament Conference,
and he therefore is not expected to be able to shed auch, if
any, light on that area of our interest.
7. The possibility that NOSENXO's defection was de-
signed to wreck the conference was most carefully considered.
The decision to accept his was taken on the conviction that
the Soviets would not have chosen such a vulnerable agent
(staff officer of the KGB) for this kind of boye.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Chief, Support Branch
FROM
Chief, Operational Support Division
SUBJECT
AEEFOXTROT
#262622
This memorandum is primarily for the record and will
record the essence of a meeting held on the morning of 12 May
1964, at which the following were present Messrs. Charles Kane,
Jack Bauman, OS: Dr. Charle Bohrer, Medical Staff; Messrs.
Bagley Karr@ovich. (222) McMahon and David Murphy, SR Division.
2.
The essence of this meeting was furnished to the Acting
Chief, Support Branch on 12 May 1964, as follows:
Effective immediately or as soon as practicable, the following
procedures will apply with regard to the handling of the
Subject:
(1) Subject will receive a regular diet with modest regulated
portions. He is to have no dessert or "trimmings,
but may have the necessary silverware with which to
eat properly. (CAUTION--Extreme care should be
ECCLOS.
exercised with regard to controlling the silverware,
and it was suggested that at least two of the guards-
asso
be required to count the silverware in and out; that
asso
the silverware be placed on the tray in a manner
(2) D
where it could be observed before the guards enter
the room, etc. )
(2) D
(2) Arrangements are to be made for the installation of
(2-3)
adequate air-conditioning equipment to insure that a
(2-3)
comfortable temperature is maintained. (It is under-
(2-3)
stood that there is quite a bit of equipment available
through Logistics channels.)
(2-3)
(3) Subject is to receive a bath; change of underwear;
change of uniform; and a change of linen for his bed.
(3)


(4) Subject is to receive a haircut, the shorter- the better.
(5) Subject is to receive one cigarette on 12 May 1964.
(NOTE- These changes with regard to the bath, haircut,
cigarette are not to be considered as something to be
done on regular schedule. We will await specific
instructions from SR Division as to when these items
are to be accomplished in the future.)
(6) Effective immediately, Dr. Bohrer will visit the
Subject only on Tuesday each week.
(7) In addition to the above, it must be emphasized that
our attitude toward the Subject will remain precisely
the same, and our security procedures, including
searches, will continue to be at maximum control.
3. It was further ascertained that we will have custody of
the Subject until at least July. It was suggested that perhaps we may
wish to explore some modifications in the assignment of personnel
or schedule of assignments. In addition, the Acting Chief, Support
Branch has suggested that immediate consideration be given to
devising necessary procedures to be followed in the event of an
emergency involving loss of control of the Subject. This should
be discussed immediately with the responsible DFO supervisors
and specific procedures devised, and all guards properly informed
as to their responsibilities in this matter.
