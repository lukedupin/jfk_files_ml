4. On 8 December 1960 Jose Xavier CONTES Hernandez, who represents himself as a
priest. told Jose Antonio PORTUOIDO Valdor, Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, that
he had information that "the thing they were working on" had gotten underway
and had produced a tremendous reaction in Cuba. 2 He said that a friend, who
is Roman Catholic but very liberal, had returned from a visit to Cuba, where
he said the Knights of Columbus were pretty well entrenched. For this reason,
CONTES said he felt it would be necessary to "take the bull by the home" and
begin things or the Knights of Gállumbus would gain the advantage.
2. PORTUOIDO said that the bombing of the church of Father DOZA in Cuba had
definitely been an act of *auto-agresion" and was clumsily done. He said a
red ring with hammer and sickle was found in the debria. PORTUOIDO told CONTES
that-Carlos OLIVARES, Under-secretary of Foreign Affairs, had not said any-
thing, but, since he, PORTUOIDO, was going to Cuba at the end of December, he
believed that OLIVARES would wait until his visit: 3
3. CONTES said that he would like to go to Cuba and see for himself how. things
were going.
Field Comments
1. According to an untested bourse in the Roman Catholic Church, CONTES
Iernandes was never 8 priest. It was previously reported that Atisbos,
Mexico City newspaper, had reported that CONTES was a Catholic priest and
a member of the Jesuit order until 1950 when he left the order because of
his "bellicious and anarchis spirit".
2. It is believed that CONTES Hernandes, who belongs to a schicmatic Catholic
church, called the Mexican Apostolic Catholic Church, is interested in
establishing a schmatic church in Cuba.
3. Source Comment. PORTUOIDO's remark about OLIVARES came after he and CONTES
had been discussing German Lence, Christista priest who has been stopped by
episcopal sanction from his ministry in Oriente province.
