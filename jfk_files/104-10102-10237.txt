CQNTINUATION OF
DISPATCH
AMTRUNK/1 in turn may be expected to keep AMCAPE/1 fully informed.
There is to KUBARK control over AMTRUNK/1 or AMCAPE/1.
B. This operation has a very high "flag-potential" if any AMTRUNK
agents are picked up by the opposition in Cuba. Not only will
KUBARK stand to suffer, but ODACID will be tied directly in to the
operation, as may also QKFLOWAGE, by whom AMTRUNK/1 is employed,
and AMCAPE/1 and his newspaper. The latter could prove to be most
embarrassing and should be fully recognized as a possibility, if
the AMTRUNK is not a very easy way. The AMTRUNK team fall into
Castro's hands.
C. The security of this operation has certain questionable aspects.
At least six people were told about the operation in varying degrees
prior to the time the team was safehoused. Two of the agents.
AMICE/27 and AMICE/14, did not satisfactorily resolve the question of
the problem of the operation. The problem of the operation was not
is withholding information of an unknown nature from his KUBARK con-
tacts. An undercurrent of friction has recently developed between
AMICE/14 and AMTRUNK/3 which manifested itself in a fistfight on
29 March. This was precipitated by AMTRUNK/3 who called AMICE/14
and AMICE/14, which is necessary, the ultimate insult to a Cuban.
This in turn gives rise to the question whether AMICE/14, with a
possible history of homosexuality (see UFGA-8411), has made
such an approach to AMTRUNK/3.
D. The commitments made to AMICE/27 or which AMICE/27 claims were
made to him are a matter of concern to the Station. This is an
area over which future misunderstanding or aggravation might easily
develop.
E. The Phase I landing point appears highly risky. It is within
five miles of a cruise missile site radar, and in an area frequently
patrolled by sea.
RABEL TRENZ
F. This operation appears possibly competitive with AMICE/3 opera-
tions aimed also at penetrating high military levels for the same
purposes. Given the lack of control in the AMTRUNK operation, the
possibility of the two operations crossing or targeting on the same
individual will be present.
3. In examining the strengths of the AMTRUNK operation, the AMTRUNK
group as a whole represents superior agent material. Three of the
other two operations, adding in training. They appear to have a
number of fairly well placed contacts on the inside whom they ex-
pect to be able to call on for assistance. Although they have
been out of direct touch with a number of these contacts for periods
ranging up to two years, this is frequently the case in this type
of operation. The objective of the operation is worthwhile.
4. Based on the attached operational review and the advantages and
disadvantages outlined above, the 12% of the recommendation of MWAVE
and MWAVE. The 12% of the 12% of the 12% of the possible
moment. Since this operation originated at the Headquarters level,
it is requested that Headquarters advise JMWAVE as to its decision.
In the meantime, training and planning will continue. If Head-
quarters' decision is to continue with the operation at this time,
/
operational plans for Phase I and Phase II will be submitted as
formulated.

PROJECT AMTRUNK OPERATIONAL REVIEW
I. STATUS REPORT ON TRAINING AND PROCESSING, 4-31 MARCH.
The AMTRUNK Team, consisting of AMICE/27, AMICE/14, AMTRUNK/2,
and AMTRUNK/3 were safehoused on 4 March 1963 at Safsite #164
on Plantation Key. Andrew S. PARMERS, KUROAR instructor from
headquarters, was already at the training site when the team
was brought there by the two case officers, Irving N. PEGGINS
and the team. The AMRERS remained at the safesite
until 16 March during which the team was working on the
clandestine methods and techniques. This training included
security, cover and compartmentation, clandestine communica-
tions, agent spotting, selection, recruitment and management,
and the team's ability to maintain the training included
group discussion and participation in a service area.
operational situations, several problems, and daily physical
training. During this two week period, either PEGGINS or
the team, was not responsible for positive day, spending an average
of two or three hours with the same time.
the
cussions and processing. During the week of 18 thru 23 March,
both case officers spent a majority of the time with the group,
debriefing them in detail on their operational contacts, working
on the team. The team's experience was continuing
their training on an informal basis. The week of 25
30 March was spent in PM-type training with emphasis on compass
and map reading, including two night problems, and on weapons
and training. The team was also a member of the under dis-

II. AMTRUNK MISSION OBJECTIVE
The project AMTRUNK Mission objective is to overthrow the
existing Club's government by means of a conspiracy among
high level military and civilian leaders of the government
culminating in a coupd'etat which will oust both Castro and

the communists from power. A secondary and subordinate
mission is to determine the climate prevailing among the
population in Havana for organizing resistance elements capable
of either passive or active sabotage. This secondary mission
is exploratory in nature only, through the first phases of
the 1960s. The 1960s, including the 1960s, and 1965, the
the operation has been split into two initial phases, which
will be compartmented from each other. Phase One involves
the black infiltration of AMTRUNK/2 and 3 on the north coast
of the 1960s. The 1960s, including the 1960s, and 3
Havana for a period of approximately two weeks, and then
exfiltrate black from the same point at which they infiltrated.
Phase Two, involving AMICE/27 and AMICE/14, will consist of
black infiltration through the keys area on the north coast
of the 1960s. The 1960s, including the 1960s, and 3
Havana for a period of several weeks and then exfiltrate black.
These two phases are discussed in detail in following para-
graphs. Phase One and Phase Two are preliminary infiltrations
designed to set up infiltration/exfiltration routes and to
the initial contacts among certain rarest high levels of
figures in the area. The following procedure being these
phases are not designed to be operational plans. Detailed
operational plans for each phase will be forwarded as de-
veloped.
III. PHASE I.
A. AMTRUNK Personnel
1. AMTRUNK/2 is a year old Cuban who is mature for his
years, and in some degree experience in clandestine opera-
tions. He attended<�througescored. University in Havana for
a year old Cuban who is more than 10 years. Prior to
takeover A/2 was allied to student elements of the Partido
Autentico which upheld the constitution of 1940. He supported
the revolution against Batista till it became apparent that
the 1960s, including the 1960s, including the 1965s, and
university years from 1959 to 1961 he was actively engaged
in supporting anti-Castro groups with weapons and materials.
Following the Playa Giron invasion4 great many in the Havana
underground were rolled up but A/2 avoided compromise. He
is a member of the 1960s, including the 1960s, including the
via air in (January 1962. Although A/2 does not consider
himself an ally of KUBARK be has been cooperative throughout
histraining. He is a pensive individual who displays good
judgement. His present attitude towards KUBARK appears to
be one of "wait and see". In the meanwhile, he is con-
scientiously applying himself in preparation for his mission.

2. ATRUNK/3, a year old Cuban, in contrast to A/2, is
volatile, immature and impulsive. On the other hand he is
quite loyal to A/2 and his quick wit is appealing to his
fellow team members. He worked under A/2 in the underground
as an action type, principally engaging in sabotage. His

when in 1958 he supported the revolution against Batista.
In late 1960 he sided with the counter-revolutionaries and
began full time anti-Castro activities. After the crack
down following the Bay of Pigs invasion he avoided detection
of a 1/2 and a 1/2 in the 1958. He said that he was able to
when the situation became hopeless he left Cuba by air for
Miami in 1962. While A/3 has performed satisfactorily
in his training up to date, his performance falls far short
of the 1958. He said that he was able to find a 1/2
function as support for this operation and should not inter-
fere in the actual plans of the operation. Fortunately his
role in this operation is comparatively minor and he appears
willing to comply with whatever A/2 decides. Nevertheless,
direct control of A/3 offers problems in the future.
B. TASKS
1. Conduct black infiltration landing at Punta La Jijira
(AMS 3785 I) and establish contact with the farm manager at
A/J/JJirra/14777 in the Galen section (AMS 388511)
(20065 9936147)
2. Through contacts of A/3 obtain transportation for A/2
to Guanaba or Havana.
3. Although not definite, A/3 may remain at his
(34m and train assets in maritime reception and clandestine
communications. Having completed this he would then be ex-
filtrated at Punta Jijira.
4. A/2 will go to Havana and obtain safehouse and operational
support through his contacts.
5. A/2 will contact and develop two potential assets with
high level connections within the Rebel Army.
6. A/2 will train support and operational assets in clandes-
tine communications as well as arrange for transportation for
his exfiltration.
7. Exfiltration of A/2 at Punta La Jijira or Puerto Escondido
(AMS 3885 II).


C.  IN F IL- EXF IL PLANS 1. The tentative date for the infiltration of A/2 and 3 at Punta La J iji a is 18 May. 1963. The infiltrees will make their way to a rather] farm one kilometer from the coast and from there A/ 2 will be provided with transportation togo to Guan abo or Havana.  2. The ex filtration of A/ 3 will occur three days after his infiltration. This arrangement, as yet, is not definite.  3. The ex filtration of A/ 2 is tentatively planned for 31 May 1963 at Punta La J iji a or Puerto Escondido. A/ 3 feels that Puerto Escondido would afford a more secure point for ex filtration but that a reconnaissance of the area would be necessary before final decision is reached. Prearranged telegram signal would indicate his preference.  4. The above dates fall within a favorable moon phase for maritime operations.

c. A/2 may also attempt to contact the following
operational asset if he has an opportunity to make
contact.
(desty RODRIGUEZ, age 405, 405, married,
former member of the Partido Pueblo Cubano. He
fought with Raul Castro in the Sierra Cristobal Area.
Following the Castro takeover he served as degardovat
sion of the 1970s, he was a member of the 1970s.
Eventually he was given lesser assignments and A/2
thinks he is now working (DANINA) in Oriente Province.
He claims 405,405 assisted his underground group
during 1961 by supplying trucks for transporting
weapons and materials.
E. COVER AND COMMUNICATIONS
1. Cover
A/2 will be issued documentation claiming he is an employee
of a local brewery in Havana. A/3 on the other hand will be
issued documentation as a bus driver within the city of Havana.
Both will also be issued drivers licenses and additional
items such as immunization certificates, Cuban receipts, etc.
The two men will also be outfitted with disguises.
2. Communications
Primary communications will be established through an SW
system. Both men will be given SW instruction and will be
issued accommodation addresses in Miami. This instruction
and these addresses in turn will be passed on to the recruited
assets in PBRUMEN for use as the operation develops. Pre-
arranged signals will also be devised for use by the team via
telegram to indicate their progress and confirm their place
and time of exfiltration. Both members will also be given an
OWVL system to provide them with quick instructions in case
of the event.
F. OPERATIONAL AND SECURITY EVALUATION
1. The operational aspects of Phase I portrays a mission which
has considerable potential but also considerable risk. The
area of infiltration is within five miles of a cruise missile
site and its accompanying radar. In addition boat patrols are
known to work this portion of the coast at frequent intervals.
Once infiltrated the team will not have to travel far before
the event is in the same time. The two men will be given a
father's farm for any length of time and he does not want his
dathes to know of his presence in Cuba. For this reason the
farm will not be able to serve as a safehouse. A/2 plans on
leaving the farm the same day he lands. This presents the
problem of what to do with A/3 On approach is to take A/3
S C A E T


S E G R E T
to Guanba or Havana and safehouse him. This, however, may
jeopardize the operation because A/3 lacks the maturity and
patience necessary to stay put while A/2 goes about his under-
ness. He may take advantage of his visit to Havana to
take a clandestine assignment on his own. When A/2 and 3
step ashore in Cuba, control will vanish. Fortunately A/2
has a sufficient resource of judgement to go about his busi-
ness competently. Unfortunately A/3 gives no such indication.
The reason an attempt will be made to steer A/3 towards
developing as a around his A/3 with maritime
exception capabili.
2. A/2, on the other hand, appears to have a sufficient numbe
of supporting assets to provide for his safety while in Havana
However, he has not seen WANS and OUARTES for over a year. In
addition both men are presently outside of the Cuban Army
and who are not in the country. He has been the most
in recruiting within the Army. Station reports on QUARTED) con-
flict with A/2's evaluation of this man. While there is no
evidence to verify that QUARTED is pro-regime, there has been
an opportunity to be a good reason for 3 which claims QUARTED is an
opportunist who might work for the most important work.
rebuttal. to these remarks is that QUARTED has assisted him in
the past and when the chips were down he continued to aid him
in his underground activities. This still leaves a question
of the fact that the U-ARTEES are not the most important. The
be resolved by direct contact between him and A/2. There are
other security implications which should be discussed in this
evaluation. Both A/2 and A/3 cannot be considered truly se-
mantic. The fact that a man named QUARTED is a
contact in Miami which was to be transmitted by his case
officer. The letter gave an indication that A/2 was seeking
contacts in Havana and conveyed the impression that a trip
was in the cffing. A/2 has written several other letteres
and the following: A/2 was given to the U-ARTEES as a pres-
sion. A/3 on the other hand talked quite freely about his
operation to four friends in New York prior to coming to
Miami and being sateboused. He explained that he was joining
the U-ARTEES as a member of the U-ARTEES. He was
first to Miami and then to Cuba. Once there they would go
to his father's farm) and begin to make contacts. A/3 also
stated that a man named QUARTES would be one of their con-
tacts. This loose talk coupled with A/3's attitude that
KUBARK exists only to serve him makes him a marginal candi-
tory. He was a member of the U-ARTEES. He was a member
three days after his entry into Cuba, the operation will
gain his usefulness and eliminate some of the risk he
presents.

3.4 The above evaluation stresses the operational and security
weaknesses in this operation. In contrast to these weaknesses
are the positive considerations of this approach, A/2 has the
intelligence, competence, and confidence to approach.
cruit two assets with the potential for developing anti-regime
operations at a high level within the Cuban Army. The results
which these anti-regime activities can accomplish is a matter
for conjecture but it appears that they carry potential.
The results of the operation continues, it will bear close
watching in terms of security and control for these factors
will jeopardize the operation as well as KUBARK's position
if not properly contained.
IV. PHASE II
A. AMTRUNK PERSONNEL
1. AMICE/27, senior member of the AMTRUNK group is a 41
year old PBURUMEN citizen from a wealthy high class family.
His father, now deceased, was a prominent individual in law
and politics and was at one time a senator. A/27 himself
was a former president of the American College of
lawyer. In 1959 he became legal adviser to Camilio Cienfuegos
Following the disappearance of Cienfuegos in October 1959,
A/27 began to engage in counter-revolutionary activities.
He was a very close, which time he held the position of Under-
Secretary of Public Affairs, and he was a former president of
activities had come to the attention of the government and
he took refuge along with his wife in the Venezuelan Embassy.
He was given safe conduct from the Embassy to PBPRIME in late
1959. He was a former president of the A/27 insulate, and highly moti-
vated. He has some experience in his career. He was a
activities and has demonstrated an excellent capacity for
learning clandestine techniques. He has a very large ego,
and aristocratic pride, is very sensitive, and is quick to
understand the role of his leadership. He was a senior opinion
of KUBARK, that he is not a KUBARK agent and he does not
setts any implication that he is working for KUBARK. He
states that he is working for the overthrow of the present
regime in his own country and that he will accept KUBARK aid
and has been all not accept KUBARK control. His attitude
although not host his, is frequently critical, and he pre-
sents a difficult he, and he is.
2. AMICE/14 is a 26 year old Cuban citizen who is also a
law graduate of the University of Havana. He has been in-
volved much of his adult life in clandestine activities.
Subject arrived by small boat in June 1961 in PBPRIME.He
has been appointed by the intelligent and objective, and has
a very highly developed scientific interest in the
from his counter-revolutionary experiences. From January
to July 1961 he made four biaot filtration/exfiltration
trips to and from Cuba. and has an excellent
knowledge of the nortifv...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

with and has evidenced little of the hostilities or anti-
KUBARK feelings shown by AMICE/27.
3. AMTRUNK/4. Subject is a
year old fisherman from the
area who took refuge in PEPPRIME in February 1963.
He had previously assisted A/14 in infils and exffils and will
be used as a maritime guide.
B. TASKS
1. Make preliminary black maritime infiltration by small
boat onto Cinco Leguas Key (AMS Map 4085 III) to contact
individuals who formerly assisted AMICE/14 in infil-exffil
operations.
2. Through contacts on Cinco Leguas Key, organize a ratline
into the mainland, including making arrangements for trans-
portation into Havana.
3. Through the mechanism established above, move to Havana
and obtain safehousing and operational support.
4. Make all necessary arrangements for subsequent exfil-
tration and future infiltrations.
5. Approach and recruit two key individuals with contacts
among important military figures.
6. Establish internal and external communications.
7. Exfiltrate from Phase II.
C. INFIL-EXFIL PLANS
It is tentatively planned to infiltrate AMICE/27, AMICE/14,
and AMTRUNK/4 into the Cinco Leguas Keys area on or about
23 April. Subjects will take a small boat with silent motor
into the Reys area and remain in the area for approximately
the boat which can which time they will remain black, keep
the boat hidden in the boat. The boat contact individuals
known to them on Cinco Leguas. They will be able to
wish contacts at that point to re-activate contacts of AMICE/14
on the mainland at Casualidad (Map 4085 III, Grid Square 1747)
and the boat is used as a maritime carrier. Plans will be
worked out at this time with the boat.
Irritation in the latter part of May. at which time AMICE/27
and AMICE/14 will again go into Cinco Leguas and expect to be
passed on through these contacts to Havana. Subjects will
exfiltrate by small boat on or about 26 April and will be met
by the parent craft in open water to the north of Cayo Cruz
del Padre (Map sheet 4085 IV).
