In late July 1959, Haiti was invaded by a small 9.80 of Cubane, suppos edy
as a prelude to an invasion of the aeighboring Demidican Republic. The
incursion was successfully repelled by the Haitian Government, which
publicly charged RODRIGUEZ with complicity in the raid. RODRIGUEZ the
closed the Cuban Embassy and returned to Cuba after selling hie private
property in Haiti.
While RODRIGUEZ was still in Haiti, two attempts were made on his
life. He accused the Trujillo regime in the Domilanca Republic and,
indirectly, the Haitian Gevernent of complicity in these attacks.
In November 1959, RODRIGUEZ went to Guatemala as Cuban Ambassade
There, he appears to have associated freely with pro-Communist groups. I
March 1960, he was requested by the Guatemalan Government to leave the
country on the ground that he was engaging in activities inimical to the best
interests of Guatemala.
In November 1960, RODRIGUEZ reported to Karachi, Pakistan, as Cuba
Ambassador. His wife accompanied him there and served as his chief
secretary. During the initial months of his tour there, his closest relation
in the diplomatic colony were with officials of the Belgian Embassy,
presumably as a result of the fact that Belgium had represented Cuba when
there was no Cuban representative in Karachi. During 1961, however, his
social contacts were almost exclusively with Soviet, satellite and Chinese
Communist diplomatic personnel.
In late 1961, when RODRIGUEZ apparently had decided to defect, he
confided to an acquaintance in the diplomatic colesay that he was finished
with politics and wanted to devote the rest of his life to agriculture. He ho
at the time to go to the Domilican Republic or to another, unspecified Sout
American nation. At the time of his departure from Karachi by air for
Germany in early 1962, MODRIGUEZ reportedly made ealy a very limited
statement at the airport regarding his defectioua. The event apparently
received very little, if any, press notice in Pakistan.
Insufficient information exists at present to permit a determinicae as :
the genuineness of RODRIGUEZ's disfeffection with the Castro re regime. Fo:
reasons which have not as yet been fully reported, the Department of State
denied a visa to RODRIGUEZ, apparently after he had made the decision to
resiga his post in Pakistan. We understand, however, that, following his

arrival in France in January 1962, he received permission from French
authorities to travel to and reside in Martialique. It appears that he led
France on 31 January 1962 en route to Matricique.
This service would appreciate having the results of any debriefing of
RODRICUEZ by French authorities, with particular reference to the reasons
for his resignation and his plans for the future.
