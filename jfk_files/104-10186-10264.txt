3. In a report dated 19 October 1963, source unknown, it was stated
that one Osaldo RELOVA Penichet was appointed administrator of
"Envases del Cerro, S.A." firm, located on Calzada del Cerro
Avenue, Habana.
4. A fairly reliable source, in a report dated 23 October 1963,
revealed that Osvaldo RELOVA, First Secretary of the Cuban Embassy
in Canada, left Kingston for Toronto on 21 October 1963, on
TCA flight number 885.
5. An Official Candidate, however, in a report dated 26 November 1963,
saf√© that Osvaldo RELOVA Pehicitet, born on 13 August 1930, was
also a member of the Library of the Cuban Embassy in Canada as previous
reports stated. Rather, RELOVA, who was a frequent visitor to
Canada, traveled as an "Embassy Inspector." He carried Cuban
Diplomatic passport D/63/415 with Mexican visa number OF-7090; he
had no Canadian visa. The address on his passport was given as
a request for the US. He was a member of the American American
Canada on 16 August 1963, destined to visit Jesus YANES Rodriguez,
Cuban Commercial Attache in Montreal. He departed Canada for Mexico
on 25 August 1963, in the company of Alberta MENDUCA.
6. A former Cuban Intelligence officer who has been living in the United'
States since 1963 and whose reporting over the past nine months has
proven reliable, gave the following information on 21 July 1964,
on Osvaldo RELOBA Pencicht (presumably identical with RELOVA):
"Only 1961, RELOBA was an administrator of a section
of the County of the American Association of the American
1961 he went to see source to get help with an investigation
on a Mr. BARRAL, Administrator of the Consolidated (sic).
RELOBA was requesting source's aid in the belief that source
was still working for G-2; source did not tell him otherwise,
and the source was not a source of the American MAX and
is trying to instruct everyone around him. So, the second that
RELOBA was born about 1934, is 164 pounds, five feet and
inches in height, has a medium thin build, a long face, and
a long thin neck. He has dark eyes, black hair, is partially
bald, and has a small, thin mustache.
