SUBJECT: Philip Burnett Franklin Agee
1. NAME OF OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE: Elsie I. Scaletti
2. PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF SUBJECT:
I knew Phil during the entire time he was in
Branch I at Headquarters, and during his tour in
Mexico. We came to Mexico PCS at the same time.
This means I knew him from 1965 until he resigned.
In Headquarters our relationship was limited to
business in the office, and that was'not very
frequent. We sat in different rooms. He handled SB
matters. I did the routing of all Branch
correspondence which meant I decided what he was to
see--this was anything affecting Soviet/Satellite/
Chinese matters. My main areas of responsibility
were in the support field. Even though we were both
processing out at the same time, we did not exchange
stories much. However, since I traveled as a
"Tourist" and was not therefore allowed to bring
anything into Mexico, Phil offered to have some of
my things packed with his household effects since
he said he owned hardly anything. One day my husband
and I took some boxes of things over to his apartment
before work. I do not remember the name of the
apartment development in Virginia, but it was the
garden type. His apartment was nice--fairly new
but sparsely furnished. He helped us, unload the things
a.d take them upstairs. Then we parted. I seem to recal
he had some trouble with his car that morning and we
dropped him off at a repair shop on the way to the
office.
At this time, in Washington, Phil was very
pleasant, was nice to work with. He did not appear
to be pushy, even though he did everything he could
to get the Mexican assignment. At this time, despite
his family problems, he did not appear to let these
affect his work. At least from my position he seemed
to get his work done, not to procrastinate, not to
take a lot of time off. From the gossip I heard,
he was separated, and was anxious to get any assignme it
overseas. When the possibility of this Olympic job
opened up in Mexi'co he grabbed it. As I recall; C/WH/1
was sympathetic toward him also, and was happy to be
able to help Phil at this particular time.

We just greete: each other. he said he heard PROCEBT
was coming to Mexico and asked if he were here. He
wanted to call and say hello. I said yes.
immediately informed PROBERT, and suggested the
latter, read Phil's file at the Station as it was
my understanding there was some problem about his
resignation, but did not know all the details.
(This was true as personnel matters in the Station
were kept very close by the front office.) I do
not know if, when, or iow many times PROBERT might
have met witn Phil. At this time Phil looked neat
and well kept, as I recall.
3. SUBJECT'S KNOWLEDGE OF SCALETTI, PROJECTS, OR
OPERATIONS IN WHICH SCALETTI PARTICIPATED
a). Phil could definitely identify me as a long-
time BKTRUST employee
b). Phil probably knew that Mexico was my first overseas
assignment, and possibly that I had a medical
hold before. He knew I had spent "many years"
in Branch I, and was privy to almost everything
going on at the Mexico City Station. He
knew I was assigned to Mexico under tourist
cover but worked inside the Embassy. He knew
my husband was here as a professor at the Universit
of the Americas, and that he did not work for BKTRUS
c). In Headquarters Phil knew I handled mostly athe
support projects plus sucicEXtras as ILLINK) and
20 (L)GLOBE (both NOO)24 ILLINK)had closed down either
just as Phil came to the Branch, or just before.
However, GARY H. REMANDER, formerly with I(LINK) of
was assigned to the Branch then, and talked with
Phil about Mexico, and possibly about I(LINK)1
remember keeping the (LPGLOBE material very close,
in my own safe, and I do not think Phil knew of
20 (LPBLOBE (LIREALM was then in Mexico undeS (LPBLOBE),
but may have learned of LPBLOBE program and LIREALM
through Ex-LIADLIB (see paragraph 4).
In Mexico City Phil knew I was in the Cuban section,
and privy to all operations being run against the
Cuban target. He did not know of operations in
particular except possibly LIARM-1 (now terminated)
who we hoped to use against the Cuban olympic
target. The Cuban Section tried to talk with Phil
many times about the Cuban delegations to the
Olympics, but as I recall, C/Cuba only succeeded in

SECRETISENSITIVE
Ex-LIADLIB ever met socially in Mexico or not.
I am quite certain their work paths never crossed.
LlADLIB is still in Mexico. He has had a difficult
time since his "resignation" getting a job,
keeping a job, and making ends meet. It probably
would be to BKTRUST's disadvantage now for
the two to meet. For this reason, and to assess
ex-LIADLIB-s present state of mind, Headquarters
sent someone to talk with LIADLIB-1 in the spring
of 1972. At that time he still seemed bitter
against BKTRUST.
Other than wishing to make special mention of
EX-LIADLIB-1, I know of no Agency personnel
other than those in WH/I and the Mexico City Statio
whom he knew.

OTHER U.S. GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL
I know of none except the Olympic Attache in Mexico
under whom Agee worked from July 1967 until the
end of the Olympics.
