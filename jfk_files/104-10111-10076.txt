a denied area. His exemplary conduct and personal courage
during the resulting two and one-half years incarceration
permitted the maintenance of a very difficult cover situation
and successful extraction of all three men.
Upon his return, Mr. Christ joined the Office of Research
and Development soon after its inception, assisting in the
definition and establishment of the various divisions. Under
his early guidance, the over-the-horizon radar program developed
finally into an operational system. His sensitivity to the
needs of Agency operational elements based upon his experience,
his technical expertise and his dedicated desire to broaden
the technological capabilities of the Agency precipitated
his development of a major coordinated program of accelerated
R&D to provide the clandestine services with a number of new
audio surveillance techniques of which the laser probe is an
example, and his conception and direction of the Microtechnology
R&D program. Within this program, the success of the micro-
power transistor led to the award of Medals of Merit to two
scientists under his supervision. Other progeny of the micro-
technology concept are three novel intelligence gathering
systems to function in the air, in space, and in the sea
environments, one of which is approaching operational status.
Mr. Christ has also been responsible for pioneering efforts
in the area of Audio Surveillance Countermeasures, first pro-
posing the application of computers to the problem.
Mr. Christ's imaginative leadership and inspiration to
those working with him, his broad scope of interest, his resource-
fulness, and philosophical devotion to the cause of the Agency
and the United States have provided this Agency with an individual
whose unique efforts and accomplishments over his 20 years
service are worthy of this recognition.
