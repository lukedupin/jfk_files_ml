Chairman, Subcommittee on Cuban Subversion
SUBJECT: Report for July - August on Actions Taken to
Combat Castro-Communist Subversion.
Attached is a draft of the Subcommittee's report for
July and August on actions taken to counteract Castro-
communist subversion in the hemisphere. The draft has been
prepared on the basis of the material which you furnished
with certain modification. The CIA member will note that I
have extracted from his submission the items of action taken
and placed these in the body of the report. The intelligence
information contained in the submission I have made into an
annex. I think it is very useful to have the intelligence
data form part of the report, and request that in the future
the CIA member prepare his submission in two parts.
May I have your comments on the draft by close of
business October 1, 1963.

Central Intelligence Avency
a. Developed highly useful information on frequency
of Cuban "chartered" flights to Brezil, names and nationalities
of passengers and crew, and lax measures of control followed
by Brazilian authorities. Transmitted this information to
tation chiefs in the Latin American countries of the non-
Braziliana travelling on these flights.
b. Maintained close watch over travel to and from
Cuba. See Annex B for table of known travel of Latin Americae
during July and August.
c. As a result of information furnished by him by the
CIA Station in Buenos Aires and with the Station's urging, the
Argentine Minister of Interior indicated that he would make
every effort to prevent Argentine delegates from attending the
International Union of Architects Congress in Havana.
d. At the urging of the CIA Station and the Eubasey
the Bolivian Minister of Interior Issued in mid-July an order
prohibiting the granting of travel permits to Cuba on other
bloc countries to Bolivian nationais.

e. Fartly as a result of the efforts of the CIA
station in Santiago, the Government of Chile prohibited the
entry into Chile of organizers of the Cuban sponsored Second
Latin American Youth Congress, which had been scheduled to take
place in Santiago in August. This was one of the factors which
led to postponement of the Congress.
f. After considerable prodding by the CIA Station
and the Embassy the Minister of Public Security of Costa Rica
un presented legislative proposals to the Costa Rican Assembly
which will require all persons intending to travel to Communist
countries to have their travel approved by a newly created
Costa Rican security agency.
s. CEA Station in Mexico City developed information
concerning the clandestine arrival of passengers in Vera Cruz
on Cuban merchant ships. Efforts are being made to obtain more
information and to encourage stricter controls by the Mexican
authorities.
Department of State
a. Instructed Embassy Comkry to try to persuade
Guinean authorities to deny use of airport facilities by flights
on Habana-Mosco route. These efforts achieved a temporary
withholding of permission for future regular flights, at least

until such time as the Soviets develop their own refuelling facilities
at Conakry.
b. Instructed Embassy Rio to approach Braxillos
authorities to express our deep concern at the growing frequency
of Cuban non-scheduled flights to Brazil and request their
cooperation in surbing them. Also instructed our Embassies
in several Latin American countries to work with CIA station
chiefs in furnishing the names of nationals of those countries
travelling on these flights to local authorities and urging
them (1) to inoritute tighter controls on their own citizens
travelling to Cuba, and (2) to express their concern to the
Government of Brazil/bver Cuban use of Brazil as a way station
for transporting subversives.
c. As a result of representations made to the British
government about Cuban flights to the Cayman Islands carrying
Latin American subversives, the British developed an administrative
scheme which will effectively prohibit the use of British
Caribbean dependencies by Cubana as transit points for passengers.
The British intend to require transit viasa of passengers passing
through their areas, and to reject applications for such visas
except in certain special cases. Persons not possessing viasa
would be prevented from leaving their aircraft, or would be

d. Instructed Embassy Mexico City on August 29 to
inform the Mexican airline CMA that the United States is
opposed to a proposal that CMA operate charter flights to carry
refugees from Havana to Central America. CMA, as a result,
stated that they had no intention of proceeding further with
this project.
e. Instructed U.S. Mission in Curacao and the Ha que
to investigate a report that KIM was planning to renew si
scheduled Curacao-Habana flights and to reiterate US opposition
to resumption of air service to Cuba. KIM assured our Embassy
that there is no plan to initiate service, scheduled or non-
scheduled, to Habana.
f. Instructed Embassy Ottawa to express our strong
objections to a proposal that a Cubana charter flight pick up
a second group of U.S. students in Montreal to fly them to Cuba.
The flight was not authorized.
g. Instructed Consulate Georgetown to investigate
Cubana approaches to secure flight facilities. Mision reported
on August 1 that the Governor had no knowledge of any talks
between the B.C. Ministry of Communications and the Cuban Govern-
ment regarding landing rights for Cubana planes. The Governor

H.M.G.
1. Urged the governments of Mexico, Canada, Jamaica
and the Netherlands to refuse to assist the Cuban government
in its efforts to find a short route for return of the 58 American
students who illegally travelled to Cuba. Also informed Pan
American Airways that we were opposed to a Cuban request for
a FAA charter flight to fly the students from Habana to New York.
1. Instructed our missions at Port of Spain and
Barbados on several occasions to approach these governments to
express the concern of the U.S. at Indications of Cuban interest
in the use of their aviation facilities.
Embassy Fort of Spain discussed with the Foreign Secretary
of Trinidad various legal moves available that would enable
COTT to control novuments of aircraft within their territory,
aiting examples of such countries instituted by Mexico. Canada
and Ireland. He indicated receptiveness to the proposal that
the list of suggestions be made available to the aviation officials
concerned.

urged the government of Chile to refuse visas to Cuban delegates
to a preparatory meeting planning for the II Latin American
Touch Congress scheduled for August in the Chilean capital.
Insdility of Cuban delegates to obtain Chilcian viasa for this
meeting is one of the contributing factors to the Cuban sponsors
announcing during August that the meeting had been postponed.
it. Sent general instructions to our missions in countries
which participate in the International Union of Architects asking
them to urge the cooperation of governmental authorities in
preventing or discouraging the attendance of their citizens to
the VII UIA Congress in Habana, September 29-October 4, 1963.
Followed this up with instructions to individual peste to try
where feasible to dissuade architects from free world countries
from serving on the jury for the selection of a Bay of Figs
nouncement.
1. Urged Canadian Government to block a plan to
commence food parcel shipments to Cube, on a Commercial basis,
that would have required the establishment of scheduled wealy
chorter flights by Canadian planes.

Responding to the urging of the CIA Station police
of the State of Guanabara seized large quantities of propa-
ganda brought into Brazil by passengers on the special Cubane
flights. For example, some 50 pounds of printed propaganda
was taken from the various passengers who arrived on the 16
August Cubana flight.
3. Control of Clandestine Movement of Guerrillas and Arns
Department of Defense
a. Continued surveillance of the area surrounding Cuba
during the month of July at the same rate and with the same
emphasis as prior to 1 July 1963.
b. Continued to maintain U.S. Forces, primarily from
within the Atlantic Command, available to assist other Caribbean
governments in the interception of suspicious craft in
territorial waters, as might be requested. No such requests were
received from any other government during the period covered by
this report. However, U.S. Forces did keep track of the
location of the Soviet merchant freighter MITCHURINSK, which

was suspected of carrying subversives and arms from Cuba to
British Guiana in mid-July. MITCHURINIK was under U.S.
surveillence from its departure from Havana until United
Kingdom forces assumed the task of keeping this ship under
surveillance upon its approach to Georgetown, British Guiana.
Subsequently, British police search of MITCHURINKE in British
Guiana waters revealed nothing of a suspicious nature.
Central Intelligence Agency
At the repeated urging of the GIA Station in Lima
the Peruvian Government late in August published a new anti-
terrorists law providing a penalty of no less than five years
imprisoment for persons who participate in guerrilla activities
or in the illegal manufacture of weapons or explosives.
The Peruvian National Intelligence Service is working
on a lead furnished by the GIA Station in Lima concerning a
200 ton vessel reportedly involved in arms traffic.
Department of State
Instructed our Consulate General in Georgetown to
investigate reports that commercial cargoes (which could conceal
illicit arms traffic out of Cuba) had developed between British

the military focal point for relaying information concerning
the movement of subversives). Filled, partially, the authorized
billets in the U.S. Southern Command Intelligence Center and
took under consideration the problem of an increase in the biliet
structure in the Center. The Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Southern
Command together with his intelligence officer visited Honduras

CIA Stations throughout Latin America continued in a
great majority of countries to furnish to the local internal
security organizations with whom they are in liaison informa-
tion concerning travelers to and from Cuba, as well as such
information as came to CIA's attention concerning the movement
of funds, ams and propaganda saterial. In many instances, the
furnishing of information to the internal security service by
the CIA Station was paralleled by the furnishing of similar
information to the foreign office by the Ambassador or his
representative. The response to this information has varied
greatly. The Central American countries, in general, began to
pay attention to the information and take action on it. At the

The main developments treated in the Agency's radio and
press coverage included Castro's July 26 speech urging revolu-
tions in Latin America, the discovery of terrorist weapons
of Cuban responsibilities for terrorism, the statement by State
Department Press Officer Richard Phillips that "potential

CIA Intelligence Annex
1. Travel to and from Cuba
Brazil
Chartered Cubana Airlines flights between Cuba and
Brazil have become a major means of transporting non-Guban
Latin America on and from Cuba. The five such flights since
late July have carried nearly 400 non-Cubans.
The first of the recent series -- on 25 July -- brought
71 Latin American passengers to Havana for the 26 July celebre-
tions. The other four flights -- on 15, 22, 28 and 29 August
transperted over 200 Luis Americana to Brazil from Havana.
Some of the aircraft involved returned to Cuba with smaller
numbers of passengers. Many of the 200 Latin American passengers
had been delegates to the 26 July ceremonies, but others had
apparently been in Cuba for longer periods and some had probably
received training there. Of the passengers on these four flights
to Brazil, 75 were natives of Caribbean area countries. Their
circuitous travel through Brazil was evidently designed to help
conceal the fact that they had been in Cuba.
Costa Rica
Two Costa Ricans were among the passengers on a
chartered Cubana plane which was turned back to Havana at Grand
Cayman on 11 July 1963. One was Los Marina Hernandez Salazar,
the only Costa Rican woman know to have been sent to Cuba for
training as a guerrilla warfare instructor. She had been in
Cuba since September 1962. The other Costa Rican passenger was
Carlos Guilion, former head of the Costa Rican Society of
Friends of the Cuban Revolution, who had been in Cuba since
November 1962.
Ecuador
The CIA Station in Quito reports that the military
Juntta, which assumed power in Ecuador on 11 July, can be expected
SECRET
NW 50955 DocId:32424014 Page 20


SECRET
to follow the guidance of the Eunbessy and the Station in
controlling travel to and from Cubs and the Soviet bloc. The
activities of Cubsan subversives in Ecuador, at least for the
pressut, have been greatly inhibited by the nas arrests of
Commists and pro-Cubens and by the outlawing of the Communist
Party by the junta.
Hogularas
It is reported that the Honduran Communist Party has
issued orders to its members not to attempt to travel to Cuba
at the present time. This action is apparently the result of
the increasing vigilance of the Honduran government and the
greater implomentation of strictes travel controls.
2. Movement of Cuban Promanda
Cunbents
According to an unconfirmed report received in July,
a Bureau of Information of the Communist Party of Guatemala is
being fomned in collaboration with Fennes Latinu and is to be
managed clandestinely. It expects to receive news by
radio from Cuba and print bulletins for distribution by radio
stations. This may indicate a pattern by which Funes Linina
will attempt to distribute on a more clandestine basis in other
areas in Latin America.
Honduras
It was reliably reported that in mid-July 1963, a
small coastal freighter lunded 14 large bones of Communist
propagands on the northern coast of Honduras, the boxes having
been transferred at sea from a larger vessel.
3. Movement of Guerrillas and Aun
Argentina
Estratist members of the Feronist Party, apparently
under the leadership of such figures as Hector Villalion and
John William Cooke, are apparently receiving encouragement and
promises of large sums of money from Cuba in support of their
efforts to train and organize subversive groups in Argentina.
NW 50955 DocId:32424014 Page 21


SECRET
-3-
Villalon has stated that his plan calls for expanding and
accelerating subversive activities in Argentina culminating
in a complete take over within two years. There is no indica-
tion that Feron himself has agreed to this plan. It has been
reported that leaders of the Communist Party of Argentina have
been greatly amoyed by the tendency of the Gastro regime to
support the revolutionary Peronists without having consulted
the Communist Party of Argentina.
It is reported that the so-called Army of National
Liberation (AML) of Argentina, which is a relatively small
Castrolst organisation directed from Cuba by John William Cooke,
has in recent weeks been negotiating for the purchase of arms
and has been offered submachine guns, basokas and other weapons
by two or three private suppliers. It was reported, however,
that the ANL was having difficulty getting enough dollars from
Cuba to make significant purchases possible.
Bolivia
The Bolivian Ministry of Foreign Relations on 23
August protested formally to the Cuban Chargé d'Affaires in
La Faz against the Cuban Embassy support to the miners during
the recent crisis. Subsequently, however, Foreign Minister
Fellman informed the Cuban Chargé that he need not fear that
the Government of Bolivia would break diplomatic relations with
Cuba. There has, in fact, been no hard information linking the
Cuban Embassy with the present mining crisis in spite of some
unconfirmed reports of Cuban support.
Brazil
Cuban Ambassador to Brazil, Raul Ron Kouri, is reported
to have attempted to encourage peasant league leader Francisco
Julico to revitalize the leagues in northern Brazil. According
to some regents efforts are being made to unify the leadership
and bring dissident elements under the general direction of
Julico. Other reports indicate that, although the Cuban Embassy
is providing guidance and possibly financial support to the
movement, it had not yet resolved the internal dissension in
the leagues.

Colombia
From Colombia reports have been received of increasing
Cuban assistance, primarily in the form of training courses by
instructors who have been trained in Cuba, to the Worker-Student
Feasant Involvement (MOE). A email guerrillo band encountered
by the Colombian army in July 1963 was broken up when five
members of the band were killed and two others captured. A
sual! quantity of arms and a considerable amount of books and
pamphlets on revolutionary warfare, photographs of Nidal Castro,
Gamilo Cienfuegos and Mao Tse-tung, and bulletins of the MOEC
were found at the camp site. Recent reports have indicated an
increase in the terrorist efforts of the MOE and increased
promises of assistance from the Guevara with regard to the
training of additional MOEC members.
Costa Rica
In mid-July an increased number of guerrillas were
reportedly being trained in Costa Rica by Adolfo Garcia Barberenn,
wall-known Micaaguan revolutionary leader and member of the
FLN (National Liberation Front -- a Communist-dominated, Cuban-
supported, anti-Mieragua revolutionary group). In early
August, Alberto Serrato, leader of the FLN in Costa Rica, left
with a group of Micaaguans for the Costa Rican-Micaraguan
border. The purchase of arms and supplies and the recruitment
of Micaaguans for a movement against Micaagua are also reportedly
underway in Costa Rica.
Hector Bogantes Zanera, Costa Rican agitator, left San Jose
in mid-August for the Micaaguan border to superzise the passage
of Mieraguan guerrillas from Costa Rica into Micaagua.
Bogantes, who recently returned from attending the May Day
celebrations in Cuba, was assigned this responsibility by the
Costa Rica Committee Party.
Honduras
The Hindurian argued forces began to move against a group
of pro-Castro guerrillas operating against the Micaaguan Govern-
ment and active in the vicinity of the Micaaguan-Hondurian border.
The Micaaguan National Guard has been conducting operations
on its side of the border against the inurgentas since July.
The dense jungle and difficult terrain, however, will impede the
efforts of both forces to eliminate the guerrillas.
NW 50955 DocId:32424014 Page 23

Information on the guerrilla force is scanty and
conflicting. It is apparently composed of members of the National
Libertation Front (FLN), a Communist-dominated and Cuban-supported
revolutionary organization active primarily in Honduras and
Nicaragua since the fall of 1962. The strength of the force
is not known.
Micaragua
A captured guerrilla of the FLN (National Liberation
Front - m Comunist-dominated, Cuban-supported, anti-Micaraguan
group) confessed that he was a member of a group of 46 who
entered Nicaragua from Honduras on 22 July. He said that their
mission was to establish a base camp in the Isabella mountains,
Department of Jinotega, in order to indoctrinate the peasants
and to train them in guerrilla tactics. He admitted that he
had received six months' guerrilla warfare training in Cuba and
that other FLN leaders had received similar training. He also
said that the FLN training camp in Honduras was near El Largate,
on the Patue River.
4. Transfer of Funde
British Guiana
In British Guiana, Guiana Import-Export Corporation
(Gimper) received a one million dollar advance payment deposited
by the Cuban Alimpar Corporation for goods to be delivered to
Cuba in the future. Gimper has, in turn, loaned this money to
the Government of British Guiana. Ch, Gapan's People's
Progressive Party is the major atockholder in Gimpex. Mohamed
Kasim, Manager of Gimpex, has indicated that Gimpex will be
able to secure additional loans from Cuba in amounts sufficient
to tide the Jagan government over any foreseable crisis. It
was also reported that Gimpex plans to buy aircraft, spare parts
and other machinery in the United States for reahipment to Cuba.
General
Reports continue to be received from many places indicating
that the suitcase full of currency is still one of the most
common methods used by the Cubans for transmitting funds for
use in supporting subversive activities throughout the Hambphere.
Instasses where such funds have been confiscated by the police
have occurred recently in El Salvador, Panama and Ecuador.
