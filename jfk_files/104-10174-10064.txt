MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief/E/IB/S
SUBJECT:
Project WUBRINY - Possible Operational
Support of Madrid Station Objectives by
Edward G. TICHBORN (P)
REFERENCE:
OSMA 23, 350 Dated 11 January 1968
1. Per Mr. Long's request, the undersigned on 30 January 1968
discussed with Edward G. TICHBORN (P) possible support of Madrid
Station objectives as raised in ref. It was confirmed that:
a. WUSALINE/iberia can be used as an information collection
mechanism in cases where information requirements can be couched
in plausible economic and commercial terms for contractual surveys.
b. TIGHBORN can assess and develop selected Spanish contacts
of Madrid Station who may be visiting. New York and who desire
introductions in US commercial circles:
c. TICHBORN can develop Spaniards in New York as may be
of operational interest to the Madrid Station. TICHBORN has not
made an effort to develop Spaniards in New York but is willing and
able to do so for any designated as operational targets. If desired,
TICHBORN thinks be can meet the Spanish Ambassador to the U.S.
through a friend, Senator Jos√© Montoya of New Mexico.
d. TICHBORN feels that he could write an article concerning
leading Spanish industrialists and bankers for publishing in a pro-
minent publication, such as "Life International. " TICHBORN
believes that he has excellent bonafides for such a task because
he previously published in "Life International" a four-page spread
on Birth control in Latin America. This article was favorably
reviewed. TICHBORN suggested a related article on the popula-
tion explosion in Europe and its effect on business as a possible
topic for interviewing leading Spanish businessmen. TICHBORN.


- 2 -
as a result of journalistic collaboration with Katherine Aine
Porter, is represented in New York by a topliterary agent,
Monica McCall. TICHBORN thinks that it would take him two
to three weeks in Spain interviewing top Spanish industrialists
and bankers. He would send letters in advance to these targets
informing them of his proposed itinerary, the purpose of his
trip, and enclosing copies of his previous articles with favor-
able reviewer comments. He could be essentially a free lance
journalist or have a business purpose as well. In the latter
connection, it is of interest that following TICHBORN's trip to
Spain, WUBRINY/I sent a geologist to WUSALINE/iberia to look
into acquisition of silver properties in Spain. This purely com-
mercial development appears to be a direct result of TICHBORN's
trip and thus enhances TICHBORN's commercial bonafides.
2. It is understood that E/IB/S has a copy of TICHBORN's report
for dispatch to the Madrid Station per ref.
3. Personnel concerned with Project WUBRINY will be glad to
work with E/IB/S in any follow-up to the possibilities noted above.

INSURANDUM FOR: Chief, EUA Division
ATTENTION
: Chief, E/IB
SUBJECT
: Possible Exploitation of ICAP Iberia, S.A.
1. Reference is made to the meeting on subject with
Mr. Osborne Day, DOS/Hardi, Mr. Stephen Munger, DE/ED, and
Mr. Gale Allen of DOCO just prior to Mr. Dow's departure for
Madrid. It is recalled that Mr. Allen agreed to pass the most
recent information on ICAP Iberia, S.A. to E/IB for transmittal
to Mr. Day in Madrid. Mr. Day would review this information
together with that known to the station and determine if the
work of the City of the City of the Royal for the Madrid Station. In
the event of an affirmative detail, the Commission's office
that he would be interested in the assignment to ICAP Iberia
of a DO career commercial operations officer who would be carried
on the DO t/o but would be assigned operational tasks by the
Married Station.
The Board of America, S.A. (use brochure attached as Tab A) is
a Joint venture company formed by a DO proprietary company, ICAP
Corporation, New York, and the Spanish Corporation banif S.A.
It is domiciled in the Banif offices at Juan Bravo 2, Madrid,
Spain, and currently has no staff. Two of the Banif Directors,
Miguel Begevarg and Juan Antonio Ruiz de Alda, concern them-
than the U.S. Government of the United States, and the United
ICAP Iberia serves mainly as the clearing house for Banif business
requiring support by ICAP New York and for ICAP business requiring
support by Banif in Spain. Recently in a letter dated 4 October 1966
at the University of the United Ritz de Alda, suggested to the
President of ICAP Corporation that the Secretary be assigned
to ICAP Iberia to "keep issues alive, look for the purpose, and obtain
the backing of our organizations for the completion of the your to
to be done." The stage thus appears to be set if WOPACT should
desire to assign an officer to ICAP Iberia, S.A.


SECOET
3. The operational potential of ICAF Iberis. S.A., other
than non-oCicial commercial cover, must necessarily depend upon
the activities, personal, and contacts of Banff As may be
noted in the descriptive note on Banff attached as Tab B, the
proposed Act of 1989, and the Act of 1989, as securities;
new business, underwriting, and investment. These activities;
cut across most aspects of economic and political life in Spain.
Banff's personnel have impressive backgrounds and its clients
and references are of a very high level.
4. Attached as Tab C are three additional perchlets on
Banff covering its research and study department, its financial
services, and its investment bulletin.
5. DO would appreciate your comments on assigning a WOPACT
officer to ICAP Iberia, S.A. Normally, when a DC commercial
mechanism provides a cover opportunity; the Area Division supplies
the officer to be assigned. DO would, of course, welcome such an
adoption to the commercial market. This is a new product of
also be willing to consider a suitable career trainee for assignment
to DO and thence to ICAP Iberia, S.A.'as part of Do's development
of career commercial operations officers. Mr. Alice of DOOO,
Code 11, Extention 62888, may be contacted for further information
on this matter.

FROM
Chief, DO Distal
Subject: Information about Spain (and Portugal)
1. I have a request which seems to me to be right up the alley
of your friend, WUBRINY/1. I would hope, therefore, that he. will try
to do us a fairly rapid and yet analytic lobe.
2. The request is for as accurate information as possible on
the following questions:
a. What or who, or both, represent the most significant
power elements in the economic or commercial field in Spain
today? Wherever possible, even in the cases where potent
companies have been named, specific individuals having the
positions of authority should be identified. In addition, where-
ever possible, relationships between these individuals and
American interests whether a company or another individual
should be specified.
b. What American interests, corporate or personal, have
major investments or holdings in Spain? What are the nature
of their investments or holdings and who are the individuals
basically responsible?
c. To the extent possible, provide the same answers as
requested above for Portugal. Since Spain is of greater inter-
est, this question should only be answered to the extent possible
without too great an expenditure of time. If on the other hand it
is felt that good answers can be provided with regard to Portugal
given extra time. I would suggest that the Spanish answers be
submitted as soon as possible and the Portuguese information
given at a later date.
3. I would appreciate it if you could let me know as soon as pos-
sible WUBRINY/1's reaction to the above requests - can he got the answers;
will they be in considerable detail and how long does he think that it will take?


2
P.S. It is assumed that, if it is possible to do it at all, the
above- request can be carried out without stirring a lot of curiosity
and consequent inquiry.

Attached under separate cover is a press clip of a front-page
editorial which appeared in Newspaper B on 16 December 1961. According
to TICHSORK, the "press interview" was arranged on 15 December through a
telephone conversation initiated by an assistant staff writer of Hera-
paper B. At that time, TICBORN was regueated to prepare a written commen-
tary on the topa as presented in the press clip, and on the evening of
15 December, TICHEORK's drafted commentary was submitted to a minor staff
writer of Newspaper B. While the subject press article was presented as
a personal "interview" with by-line authorship given to the writer as
indicated, TICHEORK reports that he and the credited author have never been
in contact with each other. Subject clip is being forwarded for Head-
quarters information and interest.

Although the sweet sound of 20 hillion dollars created a momentary
amphoria at the Punta del Fate conference several weeks ago, it is now ob-
vious that Presideni Kennedy's prodigious "Allarza para el Progreso"
faces a difficult mercatal future.
The delegates had scarcely returned home when the Goslart-Brazilian
criais erupted and thereby threatened the very beginings of Konneely's hope-
ful proposal. And certainly no seasoned chaverver of Latin Amerlean poll-
tics can assume that the Brazilian crisis has been resolved by the quickly-
deviated modus operandi which permitted Joao Goulart to assume the presi-
dency. Goulart Inisted the constitutional amendment limiting his powers
be submitted to Brazilian voters in a referendum, clearly indicating he will
not be content with a mere figurhead status. With the conservative mili-
tarists still adamant in their opposition to a fully-powered Goulart, a civil
war (a prolonged and bloody one) may be in the offing. Meanwhile, the cre-
ators of the Alliance for Progress final themselves in a watchful, hopeful
dither.
But, aside from the Brazilian problem, the Alianes already had and
still has a number of formidable obstacles which were readily observable
from the outset. Fully granting the immense possibilities offered by this
economic Magna Carta for the Amerlcas, it wcdin be foolish to overlook or
to minimize those music harsh realities of which dreams are not made.
Among the toughest realties facing the Alliance is the Congress of
the United States, which has always been reluctant to approve lang-range


foreign aid. Even before the U. S. declaration had returned to Washington,
Senator Thrusto: Morton grumplly informed the press that the Republican
Party would have no part of Dillon's "wild schemes." Then, in a week of
nov-yov-have-11-saw-you-don't hickaring in the House and Senate, the Al-
liance spenders were given to understand that the carte is not quite so
blanche as they might hope.
Even assuming a more generous Congressional attitude toward long-
range financing rather than year-to-year appropriations, some observers
were inclined to alopticism in re Treasury Secretary Dillion's lmpiled prom-
ise of 30 billina dollars over a ten-year period. Answering the attempts,
Dillon assured the Punita del Kato delegates that a large ahare of the 20 bil-
lion would come from auch already-ostablished and soon-to-be-expanded
agancies as the Export-Import Bank, Development Loan Fund, the World
Bank, the International Cooperation Administration, International Finance
Corporation and the Inter-American Development Bank. He also expects
increased investment by private entities. But, notwithstanding such assur-
ances, certia financial experts view Dillon's figure as overly optimistic.
They point at, for example, that Dillon's expectation of 300 million dollars
from the World Bank is unrealistic in view of the fact that it extended only
148 million dollars in credits to Latin America in 1960.
As for Secretary Dillon's expectations for increased investments and
loss from private sources, the skeptics would appear to have even greater


reason for gloom. On August 11nd of this year the U.S. Department of
Craszercu pultition a report andicating a sharp unprecedented drop in
private U.S. investments in Latin America. Whereas in 1959 said invest-
ments totaled 218 million dollars, the total catapulted to a mere 95 million
in 1960, a loss of more than 80 per cent in one year. Much of the blame
for this sudden fear can be traced to the Cuban revolution and the sudden
upsurge of revolutionary ferror ciewberc in the hemisphere. Hoveter,
fiscal exports are quick to point out two other factors: (1) the termination
of heretofore accelerated expansion of mining operations and (2) the sud-
den deceleration of activity in the petroleum industry in Venesules In the
latter case one cannot disinta the impact of Castro's expropriation pelicles
as reflected in neighboring republics.
Traveling through the U.S. (reading and hearing press and television
commentaries and talking with certain members of Congreas), one gets the
impression that the Allanza's primary problems will be of an economic na-
ture. But, here in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America, one has the
feeling that the political obstacles will be equally if not more troblosome.
For President Kennedy and his aides the size que non of the Allanza
la a program of structural reforma -- administrativa, fiscal, agrarian, etc.
by all or most of the participating countries. Perhaps the late, the U. 8.
has realised that the Castroism it so vehemently abhors and fears has its
most affective base where aquolar and disease and social injustrice abound
in the presence of arrogant wealth and power. Whereas Uncle Sam ance
supported and codiled the Trujillos, Jirones, etal., it now


-4-
espouses political and social reforms of a fundaneotil nature. But it is
this very lassistance ca reform (Kennedy has indeed reiterated the phrase
"revolution"), this panchant for social change, which has evorked the most
skepticism in Latin America.
In solema heraldic language the 31 nations of the hemisphere prom-
ised in writing that the needed reforms would be accomplished, but there
must have been many a crossed langer gulcing the pens that agined the final
document. Will El Salvador's powerful well-entronched "fourteen families"
stand idly by while as agrarian program anatches away their vast coffee
plantations? And what about the land-rich haccendados of Bolivia. Nicaragua,
Pern, Brasil and other hemisphero republics? For all the vagus llusory
promises of basic reforme at Punta del Sato, one cannot ignore this unavold-
able truth: most of Kennedy's hoped-for reforms will acriously affect the
personal economic fortunes of the govaruing cliques in the countries involved.
One seriously dosita that these genticuen shall willingly preside over the 11-
quadation of their personal sempires. This in spite of the fact that all of them
are fully (er at least partially) aware that, unless voluntary drastic reforms
are accomplished, their vast holdings will be taken from them foreibly by
some emerging local Fidal Castro. And it may well bo that their stubbora
resistance to change is buttressed by the millions of dollars they have pro-
videntially stashed away in Swiss and American banks during the past few
years. In short, they may be engaging in a prolonged "holding actions" to
the sure knowledge that their days are numbered.

In any event, the promised agrarian or flecal reforms may paradour-
cally lead to either of two extremes, both of which would frustrate the stated
intentiona of the Alliance. On the one hand, Government X might plane its
program in the hands of timid conservativee who interpret "evolution" as
"tutes see with minimal changes." Or the whole matter might be referred
to do-nothing, what's - in - it - for - me congressional bodies, with little
ar no prodding from the serectity's branch of government. On the other hand,
Government X might indolge in hasty Improvised measures bera of public
clamor and political flaccidity, all of which could produce one of those night-
mare fracanos which embarrass oven the most ardonat revolutionary. Most
of Latin America considers itself decades behind in the socio-economic do-
velopment of the West, and the urge to more quickly and drastically is ovary-
where evident.
Now a word about Mr. Dillon's expectations in the realm of private
investments as part of the Allman para el Propreso. According to reports
in some of the business journals, prospective investors from Europe, Japan
and the United States have certain mingivings about the program.
First of all, these busincasman feel that the Alliance offers only
minimal encouragement for pril's investment in Lata America. Indeed,
some are quick to point out that in his initial speech at Punta del Este, Seure-
tary Dllion did not ance menten private enterprise -- nor in any of his sub-
sequent comments before the committee on labor. They feal, therefore,
that the Alliances is oriented toward government to-goverment loans and


public works projects on massive scales beyond the acope of the individual
extropr casur.
Secondly, therof's considerable doubt as to the real intentions of
Latia American governments in re fiscal reform. It will be exceedingly
difficul, they may, to alter the long-standing pattern of heavy reliance on
import duties and stiff taxes for foreign corporations. Income taxes are
comparatively low and tax collection notoriously lax and subject to easy
envision by individuals, merchants and local corporations alike.
Thirdly, these foreign investore are especially dubious about the
agrarian aspects of the Allanra. They are predictably apprehensive about
expropriations of their immense landholdings for distribution in small par-
cela among the landlens campelations. (In his state of the union speech on Sep-
tamber Ist, Mexico's President Lopes Matoes reported the recent government
acquiation of three huge latitudinio heretiores owned by Americans.) But
aside from a disinclination to see themasives "done in", certain Coreiga
broadnessamen contand that small faras (or eidos) are not nearly as produc-
tive acre-per-acre as the larger estate -- that even the "cooperatives" of
the Fidel Castro type will prove "necenomic. " Rather than expropriate
and divide the existing highly productive lusurdics, these gentiexen propase
immediate and widespread coelisation of unused lande. This, they argue,
would be cheaper because there would be no cost of indemnification for ex-
propriated properties nor a distastion of productive capacity. For this
reason they far prefer the colonization means of Peru and Brasil to the
more drastic style of Mexico and Reivia.

However, all of the aforementioned uncertainties are of less concern
than the emulpresent x factor; the imjact of Fidel Castro on all of Latin
Americos. How, why, and to what extent can Fidelismo affect the Allianza
para al Prozese? Some observers feel that Castro is indeed the real (II
not de jure) father of the Alliance; that without his cataclysemaic emergence,
the United lutes would hato continued to ignore the posr-comata repubilles
of the south. (n the 1950's only 3% of our foreign aid went to the 31 nations
which comprise Latta America. Laos alone received more aid than all of
these countries combined.) But, more Importantly, the Chban premier has
aroused the expectations of the heretofore aulien masses throughout the homla-
phero, and their respective leaders have become acataly aware of the rumbling
discountant. Some of these politicos would no doubt welcome a sudden disposal
of the Castro amoyuneo, but none of them would have participated in a move
to openly chustise Cuba at the Punta del Este conference. As a matter of fact,
"Cho" Guevara managed to accomplish a few minor tribunhs despite the cool
recoption he got from most of the delegates. His post-conference meetings
with Prosidant Prondial of Argentina and ex-Pretaient Quadros of Bresil
are not to be taken lightly.
Although the United States managed to obata all of the denired signa-
tures on the final declaration at Uruguay, it would be maive for us to suppose
that we can once again count on the heretodore solid backing of Latin America.
There is, in fact, an increased spirit of metralism or independence (call it
what you will) throughout the hemlephere. Note, for example, that churleg

the conference the then vico-prasident (now president) of Brasil was on an
and shortly after the conference, President Lopes Mateos told an opening
seanion of the Mexican coagrens that his country has been and will continue
to follow an independent course, tree of any adherence to either of the great
powers.
It would appear, thusfore, that the Alliance for Progress faces a
tougher and more disvious course than the Good Neighbor policy of Franklin
Roscervil. And it is equally apparent that unless the plan does succeed,
there will be a prolonged period of unrest, bloodshed and misery -- perhaps
oblivion.

MICHURADUN FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Final Arrangements for Edward G. Tichborn's (P)
Contract Status in Mexico.
REPERENCE: Memorandus for the Record, dated 17 May 1961
1. When I talked with Tichbora (P) on Wednesday, 17 May,
to arrange a meeting vitia that for Messara. Collins and Mcccy,
he stated that he was not anxious to leave on Saturday for
Mexico City and wanted to know the total details could be
taken care of at our arranged meeting with the Board of
that he could depart on Saturday, the 20th. As I told Tichbora,
I
achieve somewhat surprised that he planned to leave as 8002
to
the
add. know he was anxious to get settled as soon
as possible. I said I would do everything possible to make
the final a meeting with the would leave as be planned.
2. As a result, Mr. Charles Pelle, W/C/A, Mr. Mitchell
and the undersigned of co/PAG, and Tichbora was Friday the
15th at the Roger Smith Hotel to talk about the meeting
with the contract, to briet his in operational details,
Station's office, and they have had also arranged that one
of their agents connected to the American Institute of
the University of Florida meet Tichbora and briefing.
This individual did attend the meeting briorly and
anticipated that perhaps at a later date, this organization
might be unell as cover for Tichbora in case of his cadaverous
and eight also be used as a vehicle for bringing prehising


standate to the US. Tichborn (P) was told that he ahould
write a letter to this individual upn his arrival in
Mexico City alroring him that he had arrived.
3. Most of the time was taken up with talking about
terms of the contract. Briefly, Tichborn will have a
reduction of the contract. The time was taken up by be
paid a salary of 80,000 per annum. In addition, for any
tripe made outside Mexico in connection with his assignment,
be will receive travel and operational expenses plus per diem.
As will also receive mileage for his automobile won it is
an additional time to be given to the customer's
fees related to his registering (probably as an auditor)
at the University of Mexico; Poletecnico, etc. in connection
with his assignment. He will paid on a monthly basis, the
amount of the contract is 1000 per annum. The time is potable
need to be worked out on the cover firm to be used in making
such depoits and this is being taken care of by both PAG
and WID (it might be possible to use the same firm as in
the past, Ashmeand, Emailford Associates). Tichborn was
noted to be received from the contract. The time was
under "operational expenses" such as air flight insurance,
purchase of personal clothing, parking of automobile while
on TCF, broken eye-glasses, etc. He was also told that
any quantiable itema should be checked out with his Station
contact and all truckers and submission of accounting would
be mailed.
h. Tichborn was told that he would be contacted on
29 May (be plans to drive to Mexico fifty and arrive there on
about 25 May) by someone from the Station using an assumed
name which was provided him. Tichborn will be staying at
the Hotel Mantejo on avondia Reforma; be can also be reached
to the City and the City's office. The time was to be
be legitimately employed as legal representative by Mr. John
Mason, owner of Producciones Marc IV, Melchor Oanapo 863-8,
Mexico City 5. A clearance is being obtained by WH on Manson
although it is not planned to make him writing of Tichborn's
activities.


5. Tichborm (P) is to concentrate on spotting students
with political potential, who vould then hopefully be brought
to the U.S. for study. It is also anticipated that he would
be able to be able to to assess the general political
situation in various Latin law. The fact that he has done
in the past, and perhaps also to act as advisor it is
operations when such need arises. Subject brought up the
subject of Mexican politics and stated that during his
work, it is not a major problem. Mr. McCoy they had stated
that it would be helpful if he could be able to be able to
Mexican politicians in order to support on the political
situation as a whole and on the split in the PRI party
and the other. He decided this out today with Mr. McCoy
and he said that Subject would be able to be able to that
this was only discussed in general terms, and that they
had specifically told Tichborm that his operational
instructions would cause from the Station.) Mr. Pannoy
was able to be able to be able to be a should only
concentrate on student effairn for the time of the second that
it would not be to his advantage to begin working in
a field which is already being covered by the Embassy and
the Section. It is thought that he will eventually be
a member of the University of the University, but he should not engage
in such activities until it has been a go-ahead from his
contact. Subject understood and agreed.
6. WED is now writing up the contract and it will be
sent to the Station for Tichborm's signature. It will be
dated 25 May 1961. Mr. Pannoy has agreed to show this
contract to CA/PId prior to forwarding it to the Station.
Other than clarifying cover arrangements for his monthly
salary depabits, there are no outstanding matters to be
settled in connection with Tichborm's contract status.

the student field in the. WH area, but 1011 that it would take
a
inless of six months to arrange, which would not be the
best sation to the current issue at hand. WH is also interested
in having Tichman (P) work in this field and Subject is most
attunsed about this possibility.
5. Tichbura (P) has several operational ideas which should
be or interest to the clandastine services. One ab-ut which
be
fels very eternly and which he should be able to be done
to the next day. The new program re-ains to be done
in the student and professor fields. Aung other related suggestions,
he relies that more politically resaising students enuld be brought
to the U.S. for study. In order to accomplish the objective of
anilating such potential, the students are able to be able to
be able to be entitled be undertaken and that the criteria for
selectica or such individuals should be based on this potential
rather than on. ast academic records per ac which is the current
basis for selection in current exchange process. He people, and
the other, are the most important and most important
londemnity qualities. In Lata universities such students spend
are time on their political activities than they do on their
audenie work, and it is anong this group that the potential
political leaders are to be able to be able to be able to
be able to be. He is attaly our requirements and intrcretes.
Tichbora (P) also fcola that profeasurs could be recruited to
assist in such spitting and also tint there shund be on exuned
exchange of such individuals in the U.S. our efforts along these
suits. The first one of the three years ago, the first one of
effect since our objectives would be different and the type of
student or professor involved would be of a ulfreient caibre
and nature. 10/6 1011 that Tichbara (P) has much potential along
these lines and vas very mach interested in the use of the
tobacco industry. The first one of the three years ago, the
no organization in existence under which such an activity would
be undertaken and hence, 11 it were agreed to follow up on this,
some kind of a private institution or organization would have to
be established and this would require at least six months.
6. The meeting with Mr. Penney of WH was most fruing
Mr. Penney felt that Tichbara (P) has same very interesting, operational
and time, and the most important of the research, experience
and native abilities, etc be would be or definite value to WHD
(hr. Osterst, WH/C/CA had also also revlously esqressed this case view,
although he had not personally net Subject). Mr. Penney was told
of Subsect's ideas in student. processor activities noted in
aera-
graph 5 above, and felt that it would be of definite interest to
-3-


the Division. In addition, the pessibility was discussed in
general terms of utilization. Tichman (P) in another capacity
within the Division: this is the
vide going program of setting u. anti-Castro: of the threapunt
the area. This, however, was only zestined as a secondary idea.
If Subject were utilized in the student professur field, be would
gerance also be called upon from the to time to assist in
the study. The study was the first of the study. The
has due in the past, assisting in clection activities, etc.)
throughout Latin America on a mere or less one-tim basis.
P.1.1990-2011 by HUD of Tichbura (P) in the student field would
be ou a half time basis and Tichbura (P) vould accept the job
offer with the TV film company in Males city mentand in
sugargrab: E above as legitimate employment which would also
severe.
7. Mr. Collias, C/GA, suggested that we might also
consider him in connection with a new political graving of
liberal, democratic, anti C.3.3.3.11 political parties throughout
Latia America which is provesity under consideration. He
said, the "tobacco" is a "tobacco" and "tobacco" in the
the full utilication of Tichbura's (P) taitents in the political
riold. Consequently, I checked out this possibility with Mr.
Pensy who agreed that be would be an excellent choice for such
an aseignest. He suggested that I talk not this possible
to the "tobacco" in the "tobacco" in the "tobacco" in the
did. Mr. Duffin stated that this operation is still in the
preparatory stage and that a project must be approved, cte which
would take a minimum of 10 days to two weeks. (This idea was
that the "tobacco" in the "tobacco" in the "tobacco" in the "tobacco"
to all Mr. Fisld atstious. The question of whether euch a group
would be under the coutrol of State or CIA was resolied on 12 May
and is under our jurisdiction.) Once this project is set up,
the position for which Tichbura (P) would qualify (oast of a
tobacco) in the "tobacco" in the "tobacco" in the "tobacco"
would be full-time and would probably be based in Caracas. The
becouning for this project is still vange at the quest and it
has also not been determined whether this slot would be rilled
to the "tobacco" in the "tobacco" in the "tobacco" in the "tobacco"
tinetable and details are still uncertain. Nevertheless, with the
consent of HUD, I suggested this is possibility to Tichbora (P)
in vague terms (that it vould be full-time, vould be on a higher-level,
would be more in the strictly political field and that be vould
probably be based in Caracas it he were accepted in this connection)
-4-


Tichbora (P) thanhit it over and called so on 15 May stating

REFERENCE: Memo for the Record, "Plans for Debriefing of
Edward G. Tichborn (P) in Washington," dated
9 March 1961
1. Edward G. Tichborn (P) arrived in Washington from
California on 12 March and was debriefed on 13 and 14 March
1961. The debriefing was held in Subject's room at the Statier
Hotel and was tape recorded. Those participating in this
meeting was held in the meeting and Brendan Burns of WED
and the undersigned. Tichborn (P) was held in September
had made, their impressions of the local political scene, his
own assessment of the situation, personal comments on the
economy and government obtained from "almmning" among the
members of the public. Tichborn (P) also pointed out areas
in which we could make a positive contribution and gave a
number of over-all recommendations concerning the political
and eccomatie fields.
2. The WED representatives were very favorably impressed
with Tichborn (P) personally and with his activities while in
El Salvador on the related TTY mission.
3. The American Ambassador to El Salvador had met Tichborn (P)
while there and was sufficiently impressed with him that he sent
a telegram to Mr. Thomas Mann of the Department suggesting that the
26/253263


latter might find it very profitable to contact Tichborn (P)
and it is not the Salvation situation with him (see GAILY 3630,
III 16568, dated 10 March 1997). The "Cup" was
apprised upon his arrival that if he did meet with Mr. P. Vass
that he should not conceal the fact that he had gone to E1
Salvador on behalf of CIA. (In the meantime, Mr. Mann was
being informed of this relationship by WHD in order to avoid
the lack of the evidence of the evidence of the evidence
anxious to talk with Mr. Mann and Mr. Paxton was attempting
to set up an appointment with him. However, Mr. Mann was
occupied on other matters and Mr. Paxton therefore suggested
that the "Cup" was not a "Cup" in the case of the "Cup" as
meeting was "suggested by Mr. Devise for 2:30 (P) and the
16th, but Tichborn (P) stated that since he had an appointment
at the White House at 3 pan that it would not be possible.
Mr. Paxton asked Tichborn (P) to call Mr. Devise on this and
was the "Cup" in the case of the "Cup" in the case of was
heard from Tichborn (P) by Mr. Paxton or by CA/P&Q. We had
however, talked with Tichborn (P). Wednesday morning when he
called for Mr. Paxton's number and I asked him if we could be
any more assistance and he replied in the negative.
4. Administratively, Tichborn's (P) salary ($1,000) was
paid him in cash as he requested on 14 March. * Expense money
for his transportation to, and his stay in, El Salvador were
made to the other companies. The money was spent in the
taken care of there. The only funds which are now due Tichborn (P)
are his expenses while in Washington for the debriefing. He
stated that he would forward his hotel bill, airplane tickets,
and other receipts upon his return to California. He was
cautioned to mail the true name receipts (plane tickets, hotel
bills, etc.) in one envelope and his accounting sheet, signed
in pseudoway, in a separate one.
5. WHD is transacting the tapes of Tichborn's (P) de-
briefing and we will receive a copy thereof when completed.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Plans for Debriefing of Edward G. Tichborn (P)
in Washington
1. On 6 March Edward G. Tichborn (P) telephoned C/DAG to
interim that in had returned from his "DY assignment to El
Salvador. Be felt that his strip ban been a successful one and
that he would have a meeting report to submit. He also suggested
that he felt it would be useful he were debriefed by the
interested parties at Headquarters.
2. C/PAG and I agreed that this would be the most useful
manner for obtaining all of the details of his activities while
in El Salvador, as well as providing an opportunity for WH
officers to pose any question they might have. Consequently
I contacted Messrs. Belman and Marshall of WHD and suggested
that Tichborn (P) came to Washington on Sunday, 12 March and
an experiment on 13 and 14 March. They agreed this would be
an experiment.
3. Mr. Marshall wanted to check on the financial aspect
of Tichborn's (P) trip East. He asked if he would receive an
additional salary for that time period. I suggested (as C/PAG
to the budget) to be included in the budget. The budget was
that this debriefing be included in the salary he was informed
he would receive for this assignment. (This figure would be
$500 per week, or $1,000 for two weeks.) Expenses covering this
projected trip to Washington would; however, be separate.
Also mentioned to Mr. Belman that this would be to
Tichborn and that I felt be would be assigned to the time to
bring the total time he was on assignment for WH to two weeks.
Mr. Felman agreed that I should call Tichborn (P) and ask him
20/253203


to come East next Sunday since he felt it extremely important
that they talk with him first-hand. (Mr. Homan did not seem
to be particularly concerned about the question of salary in
this case.)
4. As a result of this go-ahead from Red Holman, I
called Tichborn (P) on 7 March. Enclined the question of
salary as best I could be able-talk, and he said he under-
stood. He also said, he had informed C/PAG that he could
not be able to do it. U.S. for more than a ten-day period at
the time, but that he could then come on to the next day.

he will also sign the amendment to his contact and the out-
standing financial matters will be taken care of.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: DTV Assignment of Edward G. Tichbora (P) to E1 Salvador
REPERENCES: A. Memorandum for the Record, 18 January 1961
B. Memorandum for the Record, 23 January 1961
1. In early January we had suggested to WH/Salvador that
they might find the services of a political consultant of value
in their area. The Division checked this out with the Station
of the United States. The idea worth looking into and asked for
additional details. This was a matter that has forwarded to the field
and in reply, the Station requested that the new to the individual
concerned to E1 Salvador to assess the political situation and
to give them any related assistance possibility.
2. As a consequence, Mr. Davis contacted Edward o. Tichbora (P)
by telephone and told him of our interest. Due to the Station's
request which we wanted to fill promptly, and also to Tichbora's (P)
personal schedule (and the possibility that he might receive an
adoption of the administration in the near future) we
wanted to get his to. Salvador, who was a member of the
solution with Tichbora (P) and with the Desk, it was decided that
he would leave California on 23 February and arrive in Salvador
the following morning.
3. In his telephone conversation, Mr. Davis was forced to
rely on the slytes of "double talking" for the purpose of security;
however, the possibility that his services might be required had
CROINT

already been maintained to Richmond (P) when he was in Washington
on personal matters in January (see Ref. B). Mr. Davis also
attempted to "second guess" Tichborn's (P) feelings on this
assignment when arranging the details with MHD. The fact that
he might receive an appointment was the major factor under
consideration, especially in the sense that first, we did not
want to expose Tichborn (P) as a KUBARK agent and secondly,
we did not want in any way to present Tichborn (P) with any
problem of the first one.
6. Mr. Davis told Tichborn (P) in guardiet language which
was apparently well understood by him that the COB ("our senior
partner") and the Ambassador ("the senior partner of our cousin
firm) would be vitting as to his KUBARK connections and that
undoubtedly JURGGETIANT (an American cut-out and contact of the
tobacco industry) and the U.S. Government's U.S. Government
businessman and Station contact with who is with a working)
would also be vitting. However, as agreed with WH, the locals
other than JUWAI-1 would be unwitting as to his KUBARK connections.
Tichborn (P) was informed that he would be "visiting" Salvador
and his "old Friend" JUDGPIANT and this cover story was to
be accepted for the next year.
7. Mr. Davis said initially pointed out to Tichborn (P)
that since WH felt he should talk with the Ambassador, we
wanted him to be aware of this in the event that this possibility
arose at the Station's request. Mr. Davis added that of course
we would not want the Ambassador to take umbrage, etc. at
which the American Society's activities and that we had been assured
by someone (Paul Poirier) and the President of the United States
that the latter could be counted upon for his cooperation and
discretion. Tichborn (P) then asked specifically whether he
had to be given a total with the Ambassador and Mr. Davis informed
him that this would be a "discretion" of the United States.
had informed us that this was a possibility since Williams is
new to his post and the Station is trying to work closely with
him from the beginning; WH felt that if Williams later learned
that Tichborn (P) had been in the area without his knowledge,
he might take offense.) In this event, the Station was advised
to request the Ambassador to use our channels for any communications
to the Department concerning Tichborn (P).


6. M had also told the that they might have to inform
the Department of Tichborn's (P) trip to El Salvador and
then decided that this would not be necessary. However, on
23 February, a final decision was made that this would have
to be done and since C/W works so closely with State. PAO
did agree to this but requested that this information be in
general terms only and that Tichborn's (P) name not be given.
WE agreed that it could be done in this way. WE also stated
that this information will be passed to Mr. Devine and would
be in the same time to him.
7. Tichborn's (P) instructions were that he would be
met at the airport if possible by JUEGGTANT (whose true
name and description were provided); if he did not appear,
Tichborn (P) was to go to the Intercontinental Hotel and
wait there to be contacted by either JUEGGTANT (Jerry
Guaglin) or the CNS, Ben Stotta. Upon meeting Tichborn (P)
JUEGGTANT, as a recognition signal, would say 'I am a friend
of his wife.'
8. Tichborn (P) asked if some expense money could be
provided him in El Salvador and be was assured that this
vould be arranged. Since time (and the airlines strike)
did not permit his coming to Washington for a detailed brief-
ing on the political situation in Salvador and on his specific
mission, these matters plus the funds for expenses will be
handed by the U.S..
9. Two cables were sent to the field concerning the
subject of Tichborn's (P) arrival in El Salvador (DIR 26346,
OUT 76088 and DIX 26522, OUT 76527). These cables spelled out
Tichborn's (P) cover, the need for special discretion on the
part of those individuals who are vitting of his relationship
with the industry. During or contact arrangements, the fact that
detailed briefings by the Station would be necessary since it
had not been possible to undertake this at Headquarters, his
pseudonym and approval for the Station's providing him with
certain funds.
10. In summary, PAO's interest was to arrange for Tichborn's (P)
arrival in Salvador as soon as possible and at the same time to


protect his KUBAIK status and assure that this present mission
would not in any way interfere with his possible appointment
to a post in the Administration:

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Edward G. Tichborn (2) - Hernia
1. On 1 February Edward G. Tichborn advised me that in lifting
his bag out of a taxi on his return trip from Cuba, he suddenly felt
a pain in the groin and was afraid that he had a hernia.
2. On the way to the airport he asked me if there would be any
chance of the Government picking up his medical expenses in the event
that he actually had a hernia which required any substantial treatment.
I told him at that time that I did not know what the Government's
position would be, but that I would check into the matter and let him
know.
3. On 2 February, I contacted Mr. Vernon Turner, SGA/PDS; and
explained the circumstances to him. At that time, I also pointed out
that as far as the provisions of his contract were concerned, it was
stated that he was not an employee of the U. S. Government and while
it did not make specific reference to medical payments while he was
working for us, it did not specifically preclude such payments,
and the payments were made by the employer. The Department
employe of the U. 8. Government, in actual fact during the period he
was doing our bidding, he was. I went on further to explain to
Mr. Turner that in all probability we will call on Tichborn to do
the following pieces for us and that while he was being paid, it was doubt-
ful that his reimbursement from us equaled what he would make in
his regular, we practice. Mr. Turner stated that there were a number
of ways that we could alleviate his situation should it become
necessary.
201253203


4. The conclusion reached between me and Mr. Turner was that
I should point out to Richborn that we were under no obligation to
recompense him for his injury; however, that upon the completion of
treatment if he would submit a claim, we should be glad to review
it sympathetically.
5. I passed the gist of the above on to Tichborn on 3 February.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Edward G. Tichborn (P)
1. On the morning of 14 September I called Tichborn and arranged
to meet him at his office at 1230. As an attachment to this memo
I have outlined the standard approach which was followed in Tichborn's
instance; therefore, I will not go further into it.
2. Tichborn struck me as being extremely quick, intelligent very
sympathetic to ay suggestions and anxious to cooperate. He is of
the most important role in the Tichborn's English fluently and according to him
can easily pass as a Mexican. Tichborn is a very good "time
over the years in Mexico as well as attending the University of
Mexico for a year or two. He has also traveled to Cuba and is a
friend of John Manson, head of Screen Gen, Inc. which is the Columbia
University of New York, and the American Association of American
might, at sometime, be of use to us. I shall not delve into Tichborn's
political history as that will be outlined in his FAQ, Part I when
it arrives. He is presently being urged to run for Congress from
this Los Angeles district; however, he has not as yet made up his
mind what he will do.
3. In the period of three hours that I was with Tichborn; I
was very concerned by him and feel more than he would do so
excellent job of briefing any individuals that we might desire him
to brief. I am also sure that if he was sent out on a TTY he would
acquit himself in superior fashion. Tichborn is called upon from
time to time to give advice on the handling of Mexican/American
tobacco industry. I have been working to develop a new program
dealing with Latin Americans, their great sense of politicalmortality,
their inferiority complex and of their unfounds but nevertheless anti-
gringo feelings. Tichborn was particularly interested in the situation
in Cuba and asked my opinion of it. My comment in essence was that
2012/3203


it seemed pretty obvious that Castro was extremely emotional and
tended towards being a demiged the had von the war but wis losing
the peace. Tichborn consurred in this opinion, adding to it that
he felt that Castro was not cognisance of the dangers of Communida.
4. Tichborn knows me as Mr. Darkin. Should there be need for
his services, I am sure he will do his best to accommodate us.

Mexico Station.
3. TICHDORN, 46, is bilingual and has a wide range of
business and social contacts throughout Latin America.
Following graduation from Harvard Law School in 1948, TICHBORN
becam√© affiliated with a law firm in Los Angeles which repre-
sented many Latin American corporations with California

California state politics and served in various capacities in

a political action advisor for Agency-sponsored election.
operations throughout Latin America. In 1961 he became a
full-time contract agent and was assigned to Mexico City,
under personal cover, to establish a degree of security
and the ability to retain their control him to travel readily on
third country political activities. He was a member of
beginning of his relationship with the Agency, he has par-
ticipated in Agency sponsored operations in Cuba, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Argentina, the Dominican Republic and,
the United States and the election in Chile. At present,
he is engaged full-time in the United States, he was a member of
left wing intellectual publication, Dialogos. His cover in
Mexico now is nominal and he attributes his presence and
interests primarily to his activities in the legal field
for his former Los Angeles law firm employer. He devotes
most of the most important information as editor of Dialogos.
5. TICHBORN has contributions, stories, articles and
interviews to United States and Latin America publications,
His major accomplishment in this field has been a politi-
cation of an interview with Catherine Anne Porter in a
recent issue of Harpers magazine. TICHBORN suggests that
he has been a part of a range viable cover for his temporary
assignment in the Dominican Republic. He is a member of
and querying their interest in his preparation of an article
concerning the Dominican Republic political situation and
the forthcoming election. There is no reason to believe that
Harpers would turn down such a proposal and, in fact, it is
believed.
6. Recommendation: The Western Hemisphere Division
recommends that approval be given for TICHBORN's approach
to Harpers to advise them of his planned trip to the Dominican
Republic and request of the magazine an expression of interest
in an article on the present situation in the Dominican
Republic. This will be done specifically as a cover for his
travel to Santo Domingo. In the event Harpers should commis-
sion him to do such an article, TICHBORN will present his
manuscript for Agency approval prior to forwarding it to
SECRET


Harpers. In the event that WH Division or Santo Domingo
Station should wish to utilize such a TICHBORN-prepared
article to surface a specific theme of interest to the
Agency, a request for approval of such action will be referred
to your office prior to taking any action.

Questions
to be re-
solved
2. Based upon the above, what would be an equitable
contract arrangement, i.e., how much money is Lopez
worth to WH Division when most of his time will
be spent working for ICAP and DODS? DODS in-
dicates that after he cbgins to make a contribu-
tion to ICAP (Probably six months to a year) they
would be willing to pick up a portion of the con-
tract costs but they see no justification for such
an action at present. D THINK T. WIEL
ACLOPT 8/17 000.
- 2 -
the operations of ICAP into Latin American and was
looking about for a Latin American specialist at just
the time that WH Division offered Lopez, It appears
to be a fortuitous meeting of the minds, i.e., Lopez
apparently has many of the attributes and some of the
background necessary for the position and Train needs
a man. He will be trained by Train and presumably
will devote a good deal of his time to ICAP activities.
However, he will be mad available on short notice
for any assignment the Agency may have for him.
1. What is extent of the possible utilization of
Lopez over the period of the next year and in the
future? ( D HAUR SOME HAUR WORKE iJERS)

DIVERIEN TECHNIAUUS, COVER. EST.
At the first mating and the one the next-day before I made the
min trip, my principal local political contact presented a possible
cost of operations in the coming election. I asked him if it were a
realistic figure and whether his analysa were realistic. He admitted
that the two years went and I told him to go back and sharpen his pencil
and sit down to the next day. I asked him to say that "when I came
back from my trip we would sit down and go over it did. I would have
and problem by problem. He and his political cohort tried to lay out au
itinerary for me and they recommended the people I would see in each town.
I would be sufficiently wrote down all these names for me and then we
very autifully were very well when it was all over and we started
making up our own list. Some of them are the most important
the list and saw. Also, our boy had a number of people. We both agreed
that this trip would have to be played by ear, since after you arrive
you-have a better idea of want you are doing. The only strategy that
we really agreed on was that I would take a plane and fly from the
south.
I did exactly that. I flew over to the south and then vent on,
smelling around. I used three methods: (1) street interview, shop
interview and in other words, people of no significance, (2) the
Rotary Club routine and (3) talke with lawyers.
Using the first method, I would go into a little shop and would
inquire about how much an article would cost. If the shop keeps could
speak English we then got into a conversation, and then I would make
a purchase. If he couldn't speak English, then I would go to another
month, they could. I bought all sorts of odds and ends - a pencil,
a little bit of time. I would have a great gift a pair of sandals
which I didn't wear because I took the original hand. I would be explained
American all the way. I wore shoes, socks, shirt and so forth. Whenever
a great number of people were attracted to us, I considered this a good
taste. I would know that the interview. As you know, you talk to one native and
there are five standing you - they will surround you. If they
speak your language they will participate. They you't, interrupt when
someone else is talking, but when he is finished each one will get into
the act; this is wonderful.
And then I did the Rotary Club routine; there are Rotary Clubs all
over the dammed place. I was taken to one meeting which happened to be
taking place in a town where I was. In the hotel where I was staying they
had the Rotary International. I looked it over very carefully to make sure
-253203


that they didn't have a list of members, since I didn't want to claim to
be one and then have them find out that I wasn't on the list! Thoro was
no membership list, but they did have the names of the officers. From
the other, I had a way of a guy who lived near Detroit and for the occasion
he became a very intimate friend. He was a doctor and he lived in the
suburbs or some place outside of Detroit. I introduced myself as a member
and said that I had a very good friend also in the organisatian, they could
have checked it out in their book. Unfortunately, une didn't always run
into one of their meetings and in the same time.
The third method concerned with our, lawyers and Bar Associations. In
any town where there was a number, be it a magistrate court or a district
area, the most important, but there was a courthouse and that in it was a
part called the Bar Association; which was a room where those lawyers most
and seconces would serve tea or coffee. If you would have a roughly
find at least one lawyer there. I am willing to be a well in the following
manner: I am so much as I am a member of the Bar. I have
been a member for thirty-odd years and am interested in the judicial
system and processes of your country. In no time, you have a good
systen and processes of your country. In no time, you have a office (I guess
Bar Association sitting at the table serving the office and theirs is even
it was tse because I hate the right to coffee and theirs is even
worse). I am not the most challenging about my trip, my interest in the local
area, I situation, and then start asking questions which I already knew
the answers to. For example, "how do you discipline a problem of
base?" and they would explain their main problems, which court and
how the judges are appointed to be explained to me a million times.
The first one of the two medical experts explained to me a million them
had it is done in our country. I was actually giving them a lecture on
American jurisprudence. I was surprised to hear that the same time
with great pride how able, however, I have just judges are, because I
had discovered that the same time is more than there is as corrupt as all hell. They
have to be why their judges were appointed and about their carers,
and this gave me a base of operations. I explained how in the 1800's
alect judges and that this system has been a very good thing to the
and we finally decided to be a health of a system and that we have
been a member of the institution so that we could now have the same kind
of system that this little country has. I pointed out that the same
they can learn from us and others that we could see something about them
technique. They were very happy and could see something about them
which we have to be a good friend before, you know that the local individual
and the car praise, to get recognition and to have samcne say something
nice about him. He will take it if you can give it to me. I am sure that
he will believe anything you tell him. I'll give you an
exemple: my technique when I think it is. I'll give you an
a newspaper I would somehow arrange to get an introduction through a local
person to the publisher or editor, or maybe both, of the newspapers (be it
a Communist one, want a Political Party, or an independent paper -- I
saw them all). I went with this explanation I was a widower, my wife
-2-

died a few years ago and I was a little emotionally upset (which is
true and wasn't hard to say) and that I was told that one possible cure
was to get away on a long trip and my son insisted that I take this trip.
The interesting at first since you see so many museums, rooms and art
galleries, and the most of them and I was getting sick and tired of things
and was about ready to go home. And I was getting sick and tired of things
interests me - politics. Here is something that is after your own
heart, this local situation. I become Goddamned curious. Here was the
opportunity to tour this country and to put my trip on a profit basis by
the other. I am not sure that I had and there, what might happen in the
future and so forth. I made it logical to me. I am not sure that I
pretty well with a lot of stuff about how I love these people (and that is
true too). My experience with them has been pretty much limited to students.
My experience with them has always been wonderful and I love them. They
can't be more than men and women, I still find them to be interesting young
man and women among that I have a natural affinity for them. They liked
that. I said also that I had a sympathy for their men, their problems and
their traditions.
In my contacta throughout the area I maintained the same story. I
was lucky to hit on the right formula in the beginning and found that it
worked. With very few variations, I stuck to the main them.
Very often I would fall into a good interview. For example, I was
looking for a small businessman with a factory. I asked a man where to
find him and was led to a lawyer's office. This was a very fortunate
mistake; a couple of times they turned out to my advantage. This lawyer
was a very good deal of very well informed and who had previously
been in polities. He was also always concerned with the most of the
he gave me an interview which summarised the informed opinion that I had
run into in that area. (He also took me to the university and introduced
me to the priest who was the head of the school. There I had a chance to
be the most important thing to do. The process to admit that they don't
understand and don't know; that paid off for the uncharacterised the
typical interview I got from the typical informed person who was
viewed I tried to be objective and find out, rather than inspire answers.
Very frequently, I would run into some person who had a bright boy
going into prep school wanting to go to college. I suggested that he might
apply for collect and for a scholarship. I said that I wasn't an official

that there was a possibility for the students to do so. It was to
or even to the U. S. Government, (I actually do intend to
these things and follow it through since they were very helpful to me and
I am very grateful.) There was some truth to what I said to them and I
vamit making up stories out of whole cloth. There was a basis for
everything I said to them although there might have been some exaggeration.
However, in the main, I could tell the story with great consistency for

I went to major cities along the way. Off to the idea I want up to

a tourist and nine I wanted everything to look on the level; I made the
vistt. I stopped at every village. If I could speak English there I
would; if not, I used this young fellow which was sometimes. satisfactory.
But you see, sometimes the willager or the shopkeeper could speak English,
and I would could and would translate and they were much more faithful to
the meaning of the problem. I am very concerned. I think I think I
and that ruined his usefulness. I kept saying that I wanted to know that
they were saying, not what I would like to have them say; that how can I
write a good story if I don't know the truth. He got to the paint where he
is going to figure out what I was after and was going to give me the
right an easy way. I am very concerned. I think I would like to know
into some kids about 13 or 14 years old and used them as interpreters;
they were good. I saw at least a dozen or more of the nevapper publishers
and correspondents, two of the editors of two different Communist newspapers,
and the other one of the other writers, and I have leaders. I also talked
to about five of the secondary people innsa political media.
The more important people in the latter. I talked to the Town Chairman
(mayor) in about half a dozen towns. I also talked with a local official
and to some other old-timers who are not active now, but will be in the
campaign. I feel that as a result of my survey I can give a fairly
authoritative opinion on what the situation is, why and what the future is.
I am confident that my reactions are sound and that my conclusione will
be a good thing.
Question: Did you experience any controls; anyone asking your name,
etc. in the airport? answer: Only in the hotels, or when I entered and
left the country. At the hotels you make a full police report. When the
others whom I engaged in conversation (and told them what I was trying to
learn) asked where I was going next, I would ask them what they suggested
your opinion about the time. I would like to know that you are into it.
Your I tried to be a little naive. I was only concerned once.
Question: Did you ever talk voluntarily or involuntarily to anyone who
you knew to be a publicant Answer: I talked voluntarily to uniforma
cops and asked questions and directions. I chose my questions with great
care. Although it locked very informal, I had it pretty well planned. Since
each question suggested another, it formed a pattern and was very logical.
I would like to know what I was the most important idea to laugh about and a lot
of thinge to praise (this is one thing that I had to see). Keeping in
mind that I was a tourist, I went out of my way to find and she
and I went to many places which I felt were ridiculous. (Subject talks
here about personal experiences in hotels, plumbing, etc.)

Question: Did you know that you vere an object of undue suricci on? Answer:
I presumed that I use. I was an unusual stranger aince tourin is not a
usual thing in that part of the country. Hence I set about to remove any
circuit, and I am a much American, being all over the place and being
curious; but I gave purpose for my work and explained it in each place.
Everywhere I engaged people in conversation with the same time
explaining my purpose, interests and why I had such interests. I think
that in each instance I logically explained my preames and worked into the
cigarette, and I would be. I think the idea of going to the Comments
accompliahed my purpose. I think the idea of interest to the newspapers,
which I might vell have been had they had gone to me.
open. In dining rooms I would find some excuse to say "do you speak English?"
and usually someone did. "Could you explain something to ma - how is this
time? I think that I think in the U. S., etc. " Pretty soon we were sitting
together, ordering a drink to identify the owner of the hotel would come
and-sit with us and tell me he wouldn't think that I think I could nevepaper
editor, etc. As a result, I found that about half of the experts I was
directed to people. I never felt that I was suspect, except by Americans,
and I would, they thought that I was checking up on them since they tried
to avoid me.
Question: Did you ever find, or have the feeling, that you were
followed from the airport, to the other. I had that feeling once, but
I wasn't being followed. For example, I feeling that I had seen
the same man in several places, but I didn't see it. I didn't see him
again. Also, so many of those people look alike, that I may have been
confused. In the reports I engaged people in conversation, always playing
the role of the curious American; but primarily one who is happy with their
country.

Operational Activities:
1. Subject vent to Cuba at the suggestion of CA Staff and with
the concurrence of WHD and the Cuba Station in early 1960 (15 January
31 January). The primary purpose of Subject's mission to Cuba was to
obtain an objective view of the political situation within that country
and to contact and size-up the existing opposition to Castro. Subject
was able to make innumerable contacts with leading opposition figures
and others, primarily through his own ingenuity. As a result he


Obtained a good deal of useful information on these persons, their
philosophies, plans, etc. as well as information of a derogatory
mature on Fidel Castro (which was later exploited in the propaganda

investors who vere anxious to assess legal recourses re revolutionary
laws and to determine the possibilities for future development and
improving the possibility, expressed with Subject's ability and
operational maneuverability.
2. From 23 February-3 March 1961 Subject was in El Salvador
again at the suggestion of CA Start out with the approval of 10th and
the Station. Again, Subject's mission was to provide an oversal-
estimate of the fluid political situation. While in that area, he made
numerous political and social contacts of operational interest and
the development of the operational suggestions during his
debriefing at Headquarters. the Government of this mission has
tourist travel. Headquarters, the Station and the U.S. Ambassador in
El Salvador were all extremely impressed by Subject's ability to assess
the local political situation and to make the necessary contacts with
a minimum of Station assistance. (Detailed report on both of these
missions are available in CA/PAG files.)
Current Statue and Future Operational Potential:
Subject brought his family from California to Washington, D.C.
where he is expecting to receive a political appointment probably in the
field of Latin American affairs. He has suggested that if possible he
is not a member of the family active for KUBARK at the same time.
Since he will undoubtedly have beenËë£ Vain America (possibly Mexico),
and will have some freedom of action, he has been a member of the
while clandestine services throughout the Latin American area. We
agree. CA/YAG is, therefore, arranging meetinga for Subject with WID
and 10th, both of whom have expressed an interest in this possibility.
(More details will be forthcoming on this.)

I was given medical discharge in 1942 after it was
discovered that my eyesight was below minimum requirements.
I had memorized the eye chart at induction medical exam
in order to pass minimum requirement of 20-200. Actually,
I have never had any difficulty since my sight is correctod
to 20-200 with class.
