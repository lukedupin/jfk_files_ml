TIDEN A, ex-BKHERALD Staff Employee
1. We met with IDEN A, a retired BEVERALD staff employee, on 7
January 1976 at his home in Tampa, Florida. IDEN A had requested the
scoting through contact with an attorney in IDEN B. IDEN A spoke for
several hours about his life since retirement in 1971. What follows is
a long consumption of his comments, and at the memo's conclusion his reasons
for bringing this situation to our attention. [Forwarded under Separate
Covance Act 1976, 1977, 1978].
2. IDEN A, who had a major role in the Bay of Piga activities, and
who was associated with JNUVEA along the period 1961-68, has maintained
many contact within the Cuban community in Florida. NCOLLAR, which
was aware of the involvement of some ex-BKHERALD assets (Cubane) in the
drug importation business, had been able to penetrate this group in
the period to late 1973. IDEN A, in the meantime, had moved to Key Nest,
Florida, purchased a lobster fishing boat and equipment, and become a
reacted member of the community.
3. IDEN A late 1973, a former BIKIERALD asset (ATTABY Project) who had
been born in the 1973, in 1978, came to IDEN A in Key West, claimed he
had. escaped from jail in Cuba in 1970 (where he had been jailed for drug
ruhning between Cuba and WOUDIAL), and also had information on drug
traffic. He asked IDEN A to contact someone who had a candidate
and was explainingness to be of assistance. IDEN A replied he had
and could only whom this later, IDEN D (ATTABY-27), another
former asset, flew to Key West, and in the next IDEN A and informed
him NCOLLAR had sent him down to check. IDEN D identified
his LCOLLAR contact as IDEN E, an ex-BKHERALD asset. BIKIERALD
contract employee. At about this time IDEN F, a former BIKIERALD staff
sleeve, moved to Key West and informed IDEN A that NCOLLAR was being
stuffed with BIKIERALD employees in its Intelligence Division, and that
the leader of the division was IDEN C, another BIKIERALD staffer
and that he was a member, IDEN A received a call from IDEN H, another
BIKIERALD retires, who asked about IDEN A's access to boats IDEN H wished
to purchase for a relative type of fix wife, the relative residing in Venezuela.
He photographed every boat in the Key West harbor, and it was apparent to
IDEN A he was NCOLLAR-involved. Later, IDEN F approached IDEN A and said

too DUMPERLO pubic in kind wanted to meet with DEN A. DEN A agreed
to a meeting, and DEN F introduced DEH I and DEH G. DEH A kens
IDEN I, but was aware of DEH E only-by reputation, which was unavory.
IDEN E claimed to be a BRIERALD employee, as did IDEI I. DEH A, of
course, knew otherwise, but said nothing. In March 1974, DEN A got a
call from DEN J of the DEN K, Hami. He was an ex-ENKERALD officer,
and he said DEN G wished to speak with DEN A in Hami on an urgent
basis.
1. I DEN G told EDEN A that he wanted the latter to work for NICOLIAR
to entablin intelligence networks in the Cuban community in key West. He
said no one also could do it, and he promised to provide at the start
US$100/week plus expenses plus money to pay DEN A's agents. He said
his money would not be reportable as income. When DEN A asked about
the effect of his own ex-BRERALD status, DEN G replied BRIERALD does
not want or need to know of this arrangement. DEN G acknowledged that

would not even show up. At one point I DEN J asked DIEN A to write a
paper on the capability of ex-BRiERALD assets who were drug traffickers,
and who had been trained in infiltration and affiliation, and
WORLD coastal defenses with drugs. DEN A banged how the assets could
circuvent any government effort to stop the drug traffic. The paper
"carred LINCOLLAR to death," according to DEN A. At the end of June 1974,
DEN J asked DEN A to journey to Washington to brief top LINCOLLAR
and the other "carred LINCOLLAR" to be an all expense paid trip, and
IDEN A flew up and sayed one week. The men who can lose received for the
journey was only US$150. During the week, IDEN A had many meetings with
IDEN G and his deputy, IDEN M, a former IDEN N staff employee. IDEN G
indicated at that time than he was impressed with DEN A's own success
in key West.
In the year, DEN A sold IDEN G he had sent lots of proportions.
And been to arreste, and therefore no bonuses. DEN A said he would not
longer work for just US$100/week. IDEN G replied he assist be able to
make IDEN A a LINCOLLAR consultant to protect his retired status. IIa also
promised "IDEN A a large lobster boat (taken from those confiscated in
LINCOLLAR raids), and an additional US$500/month to meet expenses and
sangeut payoffs. IDEN G also spoke of using IDEN A in LINCOLLAR activities
and the other "carred LINCOLLAR" to the same time. IDEN A is a
these matters. During this period, IDEN A also provided LINCOLLAR (at its
requires) with the names of potential sources of information in the Miami
area. Several persons were appragnated by LINCOLLAR using IDEN A's name,
and a number of former BIRTHDARD assets were picked up in this manner.
Included in this group are IDEN 0, IDEN F, and IDEN Q.
In May 1974, IDEN F came to IDEN A at a part of and, while drunk,
said he had been asked to recruit DEN A for LINCOLLAR activities.
In June he made initial work with the Department of Animal gathering. IDEN A
made no comment (other than requesting that IDEN F shut up). IDEN DEN A
was recruited by IDEN G and IDEN J, they had made quite a point of saying
only they would be aware of IDEN A's LINCOLLAR ties. Later in June 1974,
IDEN A said he had been asked for working with LINCOLLAR. In July 1974,
IDEN G said Iu did not like having the same time. IDEN N was a member of
officer in Miami, dealing with him since IDEN L was known to be an
LINCOLLAR officer. IDEN G wanted to have IDEN A deal directly with him
in Washington, but IDEN A objected, saying the arrangement was too
cubergsome. In late July, IDEN G introduced IDEN A to his new contact,
IDEN I.
10. In November 1974, it became apparent the drug ring in Key West
on which IDEN A's group was reporting was becoming spooked and overly
cautious. Through several of his agents IDEN A learned this resulted

from a direct approach to the violators by NCOLLAR officer IDEN E. who
hold come to Key West unknownt to DEN A. Through friends in Mland
DEN A found out IDEN F. was in charge of IDEN A's operation in Key West,
had a household relationship with IDEN F which went back for many years
(and was responsible for the breakup of IDEN E's first marriage). had big
real estate doals going in A. that, had a Swiss bank account, and was still
using RERERALD cover in Mland.
11. IDEN P, who was aware of IDEN F's NCOLLAR connection, and two
other NCOLLAR assets in the Miami area, had agreed to assist LNOULAR
only if NCOLLAR officials could guarantee IDEN E would never know of
the same number of days of their informant reports. IDEN I arranged
for this through IDEN G. The two days of the agents' files were placed in
IDEN N's safe. IDEN A subsequently has been given a monthly sex
all of IDEN P's rapports. Later, when the revelations in the IDEN
P
paragraph were known, IDEN I told IDEN A there very many allegations about
the U.S. state but he had mentioned this to IDEN G. IDEN G had asserted
him he would have to pay a Washington to discuss the matter, but nothing
over came of it. Irons! July, IDEN B was taken into NCOLLAR on the orders
of NCOLLAR Director IDEN B, and it was specified that no clearance or
background check would be made.
12. IDEN I and IDEN A decided to approach IDEN F to learn more about
IDEN E. During a one hour discussion, IDEN F said he had been appointed
LNOULAR oversight officer within BURRAALD for persons who would go to
LNOULAR assets and had known IDEN E for a long period of time, and
had brought him along with the industry. IDEN A believes IDEN F
also engineered the absences of a security company. IDEN E has
since he did not want his homosexual relationship with IDEN E. NCOLLAR.
At that point IDEN A called IDEN G and filled him in on what had been
used to the IDEN N's. IDEN E's admission that IDEN E had told him IDEN A
was an NCOLLAR asset. IDEN A met with IDEN C the IDEN F. but said he would
check on IDEN E. IDEN A met with IDEN C the IDEN F. said he would
him in further, and IDEN G ordered a full investigation. In the meantime,
the told IDEN E of his meeting with IDEN I and IDEN A, and IDEN E
wrote that IDEN E was not a regular NCOLLAR officer (IDEN I) had over-
atopped the bounds of propriety in the IDEN A's and the IDEN A NCOLLAR
asset (IDEN A), and that IDEN I and IDEN A were running the IDEN
on IDEN E. IDEN E described the situation as "interolerable". The LCOLLAR
inquiry, then, turned from IDEN E to improper actions by IDEN I in
the missing an LCOLLAR employee with an asset. The Internal Affairs
discussing the IDEN IDEN E broke and concluded by Nay 1975
that the charges against IDEN E were accurate6. In the meantime, IDEN I
was interrogated by IDEN N on his relationship with IDEN A.

his financial relationship with LNCOLAR would be terminated and then

sold the boat for a sum equal to his debts. DEN A's wife quit her job
without notice, and he estinates his actual financial losses are
USS2S thousand. NACOLAR has indicated the USS3 thousand payment is
"all DEN A will get", and he is decerined to get here.
16. DEN A believes many of his agents think he did receive a payoff
from LWOOLLA following the arrests, and that he took all the money and
the money, and the money is not a whole of the two of his agents
wore burned, and DEN D, DEN P, and others in the New area quit working
for LNOOLLA when they learned of the treatment he had received and/or
received death threats themselves. DEN T. As a result, DEN A cannot
return to kay Wast, and his lobster business no longer exist.
17. The purpose of DEN A's contacting the RRIERALD is first to
let us know what has happened to many of its former employees and assets.
IDEN A believes RRIERALD should know of the false proxies that were used
to be a very easy employees to work at LNOOLLA. As documentation,
he provided DEN I's a very good way to be a new one that has been
for retention. DEN I has, incidentally, been taken out of the Inclalence
Division of LNOOLAR and placed in enforcement work in Mland. DEN I
is currently seeking to return to BRIERALD. A company, and DEN I
has, the company's office, and on the treatment of BRIERALD personnel
who transferred to LIOOLAR and the company's own, named is DEN I.)
Hio and the other ex-BRIERALD employees working at a total level are fed
up with LNOOLAR, and are convinced they will now receive a new
in that organization. Since DEN A believes the recruitment of BRIERALD
employees, both to LNOOLAR will be a continuing thing, he feels we
should know the business of life is LNOOLAR.
F'Forwarded Separately
18. In addition, he notes LNOOLAR is receiving many retired BRIERALD
people to the company's business, including the victims. DEN A believes
these persons, in many instances, are being both used and abused; Any
flap which occurs as a result of LNOOLAR in management will bounce
back on BRIERALD, since it appears BRIERALD is involved in the LIOOLAR
operation. Indeed, DEN C has given the impression his activities have
been cleared with and approved by BRIERALD. Those assets who are being
turned off by LIOOLAR management are going to be lost to KRIERALD as
well as to KNOOLAR. Some of these persons could be significant assets
in your business.
19. A flap may not be so far off. In recent weeks IDEN U, who is
writing a book about the role of the Cubans DEN V and IDEN U in the
IDEN X affair, called IDEN A and said he has information that DEN C's
wife and IDEN T's business manager make a trip to Florida recently.
Also IDEN U said he has learned that a former BRIERALD man who is a

Chief, Miami Field Office
SUBJECT: IDEN A, ex-BKHERALD Staff Employee
1. We met with IDEN A, a retired EKHERALD staff employee, on 7
January 1976 at his home in Tampa, Florida. IDEN A had requested the
meeting through contact with an attorney in IDEN B. IDEN A spoke for
several hours about his life since retirement in 1971. What follows is
a long summation of his comments, and at the Deco's conclusion his reasons
for bringing this situation to our attention. [Forwarded under Separate
Covers, 1971-1973].
2. IDEN A, who had a major role in the Bay of Figs activities, and
who was associated with JMAVE during the period 1961-68, has maintained
many contacts within the Cuban community in Florida. LINCOLLAR, which
was aware of the involvement of some ex-BKHERALD assets (Cubans) in the
drug importation business, had been unable to penetrate this group in
the period to late 1973. IDEN A, in the meantime, had moved to Key West,
Florida, purchased a lobster fishing boat and equipment, and become a
respect to the U.S. Government.
3. In late 1973, a former KHERALD asset (MILBY Project) who had
been terminated in 1963, IDEN C, cause to IDEN A in Key West, claimed he
had escaped from jail in Cuba in 1970 (where he had been jailed for drug
running between Cuba and WODUAL), and said he had information on drug
traffic. He asked IDEN A to contact someone in LINCOLLAR and indicate
IDEN C's willingness to be of assistance. IDEN A replied he was retired
in the city of the United States. He said he was a former KHERALD
former asset, flew to Key West from Miami. He met IDEN A and informed
him LINCOLLAR had sent him down to check on IDEN C. IDEN D identified
his LINCOLLAR contact as IDEN E, an ex-BKHERALD asset and former BKHERALD
contract employee. At about this time IDEN F, a former BKHERALD staff
employee, moved to Key West and informed IDEN A that LINCOLLAR was being
staffed with BKHERALD employees in its Intelligence Division, and that
the employee was a member of the U.S. Department of Health.
4. A few months later, IDEN A received a call from IDEN H, another
BKHERALD retiree, who asked about IDEN A's access to boats IDEN H wished
to purchase for a relative of his wife, the relative residing in Venezuela.
He photographed every boat in the Key West harbor, and it was apparent to
IDEN A he was LINCOLLAR-involved. Later, IDEN F approached IDEN A and said

two BRIERALD people in Miami wanted to meet with IDEN A. IDEN A agreed
to a meeting, and IDE: F introduced IDEN I and IDEN E. IDEN A knew
IDEN I, but was aware of IDEN E only by reputation, which was unsavory,
IDEN E claimed to be a BRIERALD employee, as did IDEN I. IDEN A, of
course, knew otherwise, but said nothing. In March 1974, IDEN A got a
call from IDEN J of the IDEN K, Mirani. He was an ex-BRHERALD officer,
and he said IDEN G wished to speak with IDEN A in Miami on an urgent
basis.
5. IDEN G told IDEN A that he wanted the latter to work for UNCOLLAR
to establish intelligence networks in the Cuban community in Key West. He
said no one else could do it, and he promised to provide at the start
US$100/week plus expenses plus money to pay IDEN A's agents. He said
this money would not be reportable as income. When IDEN A's
agreed to the effect of his own, every other employee would be
paid, and he said the amount of this arrangement. IDEN G acknowledged that
US$100/week was a small payment, but said any information resulting in a
seizure of drugs, the arrest of drug traffickers, or damage to drug rings
will be assessed by a board within LNCOLLAR, and money (thousands of
dollars) rewarded for this assistance. IDEN A would then be free to split
the money with his agents. IDEN J, who was at the meeting, added that
within a year IDEN A should be able to afford the best and largest lobster
boat available.
6. IDEN G and IDEN J impressed IDEN A with the dangerous nature
of his assignment. They stressed cover as the most important consideration,
and IDEN G said, "I' don't want to go to any more funerals". They added
that if IDEN A got into trouble, there were 150 LNCOLLAR agency, the
opportunity to make the same thing to be a good thing. He said, "I can
numbers and code names, and was told LNCOLLAR would arrange for his
airlift cut (through the LNTUCK Air Station) if needed. If his NCLOLLAR
affiliation was blown, IDEN G said there would be compensation provided
up to US$40 thousand, as well as the other employee who had a
significant amount of money, but IDEN A assumed this meant six months
living expenses and assistance in job search activities, as well as
reinsbursement for moving expenses. IDEN J and IDEN L, another ex-BRHERALD
official, were to come to Key West one week later to brief IDEN A on the
local situation. In the meantime, IDEN A was to prepare a report on what
he knew about drug traffickers in the Key West area. Too we were
the two did appear in Key West. The little they knew about Key West drug
activities was included in IDEN A's report, which also contained much
of the same.
7. IDEN A subsequently set up an intelligence net, and began sending
back reports. IDEN A was frequently summoned to Miami for meetings with
IDEN G. Often. these meetings were a waste of time, and on occasion IDEN G

would not even show 'P. At now point I DEN J asked DEN A to wife a
paper on the capability of the BRINGLAND interest. The terms of the
and who had been trained in infiltration and exfiltration to penetrate
WOOLL coastal defences with drugs. I DEN A showed how the assets could
circumvent any government effort to stop the drug traffic. The paper
"scared NCLOLLAR to death," according to TIEN A. At the end of June 1974,
IDEN J asked I DEN A to journey to Washington to brief top NCLOLLAR
officials on his conclusions. It was to be an all expense paid trip, and
IDEN A flew up and stayed one week. Total remuneration received for the
journey was only US$150. During the week, I DEN A had many meetings with
the president his deputy, I DEN A, a former I DEN A staff employee. I DEN G
indicated that time he was impressed with I DEN A's reports and access
in key West.
B. Later, I DEN A, was a member of the head sent lots of reports, but there
had been a new I DEN and therefore I DENOUNses. I DEN A said he would no
longer work for just US$100/week. I DEN G replied he might be able to
make I DEN A a NCLOLLAR consultant that I DEN A was a member of the
promised I DEN A a large Lobster boat (taken from those confiscated in
LNCOLLAR raids), and an additional US$500/month to meet expenses and
agent payoffs. I DEN G also spoke of using I DEN A in LNCOLLAR activities
in Jamaica and South America. Nothing ever was forthcoming on any of
the following: I DEN A's reported, I DEN A also provided LNCOLLAR (at its
request) with the names of the U.S. state and local governments, including
area. Several persons were approached by LNCOLLAR using I DEN A's name,
and a number of former BKHERALD assets were picked up in this manner.
Included in this group are I DEN 0, I DEN P, and I DEN Q.
9. In May 1974, I DEN F came to I DEN A at a party and, while drunk,
said he had heard I DEN G wanted to recruit I DEN A for LNCOLLAR activities.
I DEN A was a member of the head and the local gathering. I DEN A
madds no comment (other than requesting that I DEN F shut up). When I DEN A
was recruited by I DEN G and I DEN J, they had made quite a point of saying
only they would be aware of I DEN A's LNCOLLAR ties. Later in June 1974,
I DEN F said he knew I DEN A was working with LNCOLLAR. In July 1974,
I DEN G said he did not like to think that I DEN A was a member of the
head and the local gathering. I DEN A with his since I DEN L was known to be an
LNCOLLAR officer, I DEN G wanted to have I DEN A deal directly with him
in Washington, but I DEN A objected, saying the arrangement was too
cumbersome. In late July, I DEN G introduced I DEN A to his new contact,
I DEN I.
10. In November 1974, it became apparent the drug ring in Key West
on which I DEN A's group was reporting was becoming spooked and overly
cautious. Through several of his agents I DEN A learned this resulted

from a direct approach to the violators by INCOLLAR officer IDEN E, who
had came to key West unbeknownst to IDEN A. Through friends in Miami,
IDEN A found out IDEN E was in charge of IDEN A's operation in Key West,
had a homosexual relationship with IDEN F which went back for many years
(and was responsible for the breakup of IDEN E's first marriage), had big
real estate deals going in Miami, had a Swiss bank account, and was still
using SKHERALD cover in Miami.
11. IDEN P, who was aware of IDEN E's INCOLLAR connection, and two
other NCOLLAR assets in the Miami area, had agreed to assist NCOLLAR
only if NCOLLAR officials could guarantee IDEN E would never know of
the current business. The number of their informant reports. IDEN I arranged
for this through IDEN G, and the three agents' files were placed in
IDEN M's safe. IDEN A subsequently has learned IDEN E routinely saw
all of IDEN P's reports. Later, when the revelations in the preceding
paragraph were known, IDEN I told IDEN A there were many allegations about
the fact that the IDEN E was not included in IDEN G. IDEN G had assured
him he would be brought to Washington to did in IDEN A. Whether, but nothing
ever came of it. Ironically, IDEN E was taken into local NCOLLAR on the order
of NCOLLAR Director IDEN R, and it was specified that no one could
background check would be undertaken on him.
12. IDEN I and IDEN A decided to approach IDEN F to learn more about
IDEN E. During a one hour discussion, IDEN F said he had been appointed
the recruiting officer within the IDEN F. He said he had been appointed
the President of the IDEN B. known IDEN E for a long period of time, and
had brought him along in BKHERALD hierarchy. IDEN A believes IDEN F
also engineered the absence of a security check on IDEN E by NCOLLAR
since he did not want his homosexual relationship with IDEN E revealed.
At that point IDEN A call for IDEN E, he said he had been appointed
the President of the IDEN F's admission that IDEN E had told him IDEN A
was an NCOLLAR asset. IDEN G denied knowing IDEN F, but said he would
check on IDEN E. IDEN A met with IDEN G the next day in Miami to fill
him in further, and IDEN G ordered a full investigation. In the meantime,
IDEN E, did not have a number of questions about IDEN F. He said he
wrote a memorandum saying a fellow NCOLLAR officer (IDEN I) had over-
stepped the bounds of propriety in his relationship with an NCOLLAR
asset (IDEA), and that IDEN I and IDEN A were running an investigation
on IDEN E. IDEN E described the situation as "intolerable." The NCOLLAR
inquiry, then, turned from IDEN E to improper actions by the IDEN
E. and the IDEN E. did not have a number of questions about
section of NCOLLAR did continue the IDEN E prove and concluded by Nay 1975
that the charges against IDEN E were accurate. In the meantime, IDEN I
was interrogated by IDEN M on his relationship with IDEN A.

13. In August 1975, IDEN G informed IDEN A that control of his
operation was being transferred to the Hamid regional state
his financial relationship with LONDON, and the U.S. state and the
re-established locally following September 1975. "On 9 September 1975,
the U.S. state has been passed 39 persons in Key West. IDEN A knew
nothing about the arrests in advance. He called IDEN G to find out what
was happening, and IDEN G said he also was unaware of thea. He asked
IDEN A to continue reporting on these developments. The next day IDEN A
met with a source who told the U.S. state. He said he said he said
he said he said. He said the U.S. state. He described the leak as coming from an
ex-BKHEAD officer who hated IDEN A. IDEN A's source, who was in touch
with drug ring members, told IDEN A the codename of his LNCOLLAR operation
(IDEN S), and IDEN A learned IDEN F had spread this word all over town.
IDEN A subsequently reached the U.S. state. He said he said he said he said
he said he said he said he said he said he said he said he said he said he said
would not get out of town alive). There had been eight informant deaths
in Monroe County (Key West) in 1975, all unsolved murders. There was
every reason, then, to take up the U.S. state. He said he said he said
he said he said he said he said he said he said he said he said he said he said
panic button, and asked for more information. IDEN A requested that the
emergency evacuation apparatus be used, but LNCOLLAR refused. Finally,
LNCOLLAR said "We don't know what you expect us to do since you've been
terminated". IDEN A, who had been terminated by LNCOLLAR/Washington,
had not been picked up subsequently by the Hamid Regional State.
14. IDEN A, deniring to keep a low profile, could not talk to many
of his agents in Key West, but he said he said there were expecting a
definite of the U.S. state. He since the ring that was rolled up was one the
agents had reported on for many months. IDEN A checked with LNCOLLAR
on this, and was informed his net's information was not used as the basis
for the arrests. IDEN A learned that IDEN F had passed the U.S. state.

sold the boat for a sum equal to him debts. DEN A's wife quit her job
without notice, and he estinaten his actual financial bases are
USS2S thousand. LNGOLLAR has indicated the US$315000m payment is
"al 11 DEN A will get", and he is determined.
16. DEN A believes many of his agents think he did receive a payoff
from the price of the price of the ship. The price of the book all the money and
tan, leaving them exposed in key Went. The cars of two of his agents
were burned, and IDEN D, IDEN F, and others in the Miami area quit working
for LNGOLLAR when they learned of the treatment he had received and/or
received death threats themselves. IDEN T. As a result, IDEN A cannot
return to Key West, and his lobster business no longer exists.
17. The purpose of IDEN A's contacting the BKHERALD is first to
let us know what has happened to many of its former employees as it was.
IDEN A believes BKHERALD should know of the price of the firm's were used
to
be a new or new company. The price of the firm's at LIGOLLAR. As documentation,
he provided IDEN I's grievance letter to LINGOLLAR which is attached* and
for retention. IDEN I has, incidentally, been taken out of the Intelligence
Division of LINGOLLAR and placed in enforcement work in Miami. IDEN I
is currently seeking to return to the company. IDEN I have been asked to
be a new company. IDEN I do on the treatment of BKHERALD personnel
who transferred to LINGOLLAR. (IDEN I's home phone in Miami is IDEN I.)
He and the other ex-BKHERALD employees working at a lower level are fed
up with LNGOLLAR, and are convinc.d they will never receive fair treatment
in that organiatic and a new IDEN A believes the recruitment of BKHERALD
employees. IDEN I have to LNGOLLAR tell be a continuing thing, he feels we
should know the realities of the company.
* [Forwarded Separately]
1. The new IDEN A's "he notes ENCOFLAR is rating many retired BKHERALD
people and former BKHERALD assets in its act"ities. IDEN A believes
these persons, in many instances, are being hou's used and abused. Any
flag which occurs as a result of LNGOLLAR immanagement will boun
back on BKHERALD, since it appears BKHERALD is involved in the
operation. Indeed, IDEN C has given the impression his activities have
been cleared with and approved by BKHERALD. Those assets who are being
turned off by LICOLLAR management are going to be sent to BKHERALD as
a result of LNGOLLAR. Some of these persons could be significant assets
in years to come.
19. A flap may not be so far off. In recent weeks IDEN U, who is
writing a book about the role of the Cubans IDEN V and IDEN W in the
IDEN X affair, called IDEN A and said he has information that IDEN C's
wife and IDEN Y's business manager made a trip to Florida recently.
Also IDEN U said he has learned that a former BKHERALD man who is a

may be passed to higher authority for recollect. It is anticipated that
final action will be required by top echalon Dra officials in order to
antiofectorily resolve all or part of the issues.
2. I wish to fill a grievance on the following subjects which constitutes
commitments made to me by representation of DEA at the time of my recruitment
from CIA into the DEA Narcotics Intelligence Division.
a. I was unofficially told by DEA a representativis a the time of my
initial recruitment interviews but that the retirement plans were the
same in both agencies and that everyone who uses time in government would
transfer with me with no break in service. I am now informed that
a previous service will not count toward retirement under section
8335(c), title 5, USC less Enforcement Retirement. This leaves me
with no chance to accumulate the required time for retirement.
b. I was told by the DEA representativea that in order to expudite
my transfor from CIA it would be necessary to bring me directly in
schedule "A" status, however, action asid be initiated shortly after
of the 100 to place me in compostive carce? status, I have been on
any with DEA for two years and then now, and I as out in schoual.
c. An 8 recruitment entipment the DEA representatives stated to me
that ofter two years of confidentiality, service with DEA I would be a

Publication of Items Relating to Cuban Operations
1. We met with, Crayston Lynch, a retired Agency staff employes,
on 7 January 1976 at his home in Tampu, Florida. Lynch had received
the meeting through contact with OCC. One item of interest to Lynch
concerns a book he wishes to write on Cuban operations during the
period 1961-67. Lynch currently is in the process of preparing one
month to be held in the program. The program was held in the
spoke with George Grille, who is writing a book on Matergate burglars
Bugenia Martines and Bernard Barker. Crile indicated he and co-author
Taylor Branch plan to follow that book with one on the Agency'3 Cuban
operations, and focus on Lynch and William Robertson, two major figures
in the 1960s. The program, Since Martines was deeply involved with
Loych as a ship captain, has been leading the Bay of Figs and in subsequent
opment against Cuba, including the United States, the American Society,
2. Lynch believes the story Martines will provide will be somewhat
inscurate because he only saw developments from the vantage point of
a ship captain. Lyach (whose cohort Robertson is deceased) believes
only be exz provide an accurate recounting. The Martines book is
scheduled for printing in the summer of 1976. Lynch would like to
be a very good thing. He said. Indeed, he believes they will not
publish their book if they know that is a going to publish one on the same
subject. What Lynch wishes is an indication of general Agency reaction
to any manuscript he might write on this.
3. Lynch wishes to write about the operations of the AMILAC
group (Commandos Mombisi) during the period 1961-67, when Lynch
conducted about 100 infiltration and exfiltration operations in Cuba.
Any manuscript he drafts will, of course, be submitted to the Agency
to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors, and the
if there is a blanket prohibition on describing Agency operations
which occurred in that period and place. He notes that Martines, not
fettered by Agency restrictions, will provide Crile and Branch with
his recollections, Lynch believes he can cover the asterial in a way
which will not hurt anyone or expose anything. He had no intentions
of getting into the commando raid recounting business until he heard
from crisis recently.

4. Since time is important on this matter, Lynch shall appreciate
a fairly quick response on this question. He recognizes no final
decision on his manuscript can be made until Agency officials review
it. At the same time, however, it may not be too difficult to ascertain
the presence or absence of a blanket restriction on writing about this
are.

employee (now retired) Gray's stand lunch told John over the telephone
that he wants to consider a CIA officer on sore undefined problems
and the other. He said employees. It seems that Lynch, who was
involved in the Bay of Pigs operation and is an open protononist of
CIA, is writing a book. He is in contact with Greeney with respect
to OCC's need to review the book before it is published.
2. Greeney, who believes that Lynch may be connected with.

some importance and, agency to his request, and indicated that it
could be advantageous for the Agency to remain on good terms with Lynch.

DOMESTIC COLLECTION DIVISION
OPERATIONAL INFORMATION REPORT
This report is believed to contain information of operational interest and may not be disclosed to personnel outside
the Directorate of Operations without the prior permission of the Domestic Collection Division.
US citizen, individual with longtime relationship with Bulguo
Cantillo. Source is a retired Apericy staff employee.
1. Eunioi Cantillo, a Cuban national who resides at 6791 S.W. 2nd
Street, Hlenni, Florida, is a former Cuban general. In 1956, when
he was the Chief of the Cuban Air Force under Cuban dictator Satista,
Cantillo's uncle cama to this with an one sample the same was
described as a "certain" of the American American House. The uncle
suspected the ore was uranium. Cantillo brought the specimen to
the US, where it was assayed by an unamned US survey company as
being the richest uranium sample the fira had ever tested. Cantillo
was the most important source of the American American American
of the men, recognized archaic Cuban lase did not protect their
find, so the general attempted to get Satista to change the mining
statutes. Batista suspected the general had come across something
eimificant, andthe sent a team of men to the Planar del Rio area
and the American American American American American
also tried to work out a deal where he would be a partner in the
seunture as a pre-condition to changing the mining laws. He was
unsuccessful in convincing Cantillo to permit him to become a
partner. At that time, the revolution reached full intensity, and
Saritola left the country.
2. Cantillo's uncle is still in Cuba. Despite Cantillo's imprisonment
by the Pidel Castro resign for nine years, he has never told anyone
to have been the most proximately one year ago, Cantillo
approached a retired Apericy staff employee and informed his of the
uncle's find. He did so after all these years because of the
developing relations between the US and Cuba. Cantillo feels the
society of the American American American American American
possess about the riches that exist in his own nation, and that
Castro and the USSR would capitalize on the find if they were to
become aware of it. In his view, the US shoula know of this
potential before it conducts negotiations with Castro. The general
is willing to provide the name of the assay company, no that
documentation can be obtained on the purity of the uranium.
3. The general's US contact notes Cantillo is not the sort of man who
5
speaks inaccurately about these kind such as the. He described Cantillo
as a "solid guy", and says the information Cantillo has provided
3
2
probably is reliable.
