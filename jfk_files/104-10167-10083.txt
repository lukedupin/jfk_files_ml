SALMENTS: Be called in the morning to ask for infor-

and LORR. He has been the first of the
maxist activities and was expected to arrive in Miami
last night. LORR is worried about his because of his
previous post as No. 2 man in the LIR. The Cuban card
confirms that he held the latter post.
b. De LORR says that he knows KCS well, and likes his.
They met in Mian last week. RCS is in Miami again.
ROS is principally interested in getting Reynoldor.
The most important of the LORR's was a major incen

ask Pe LORR to see his Miani contact acout assistance.
Berrile discouraged LORR about helping BLANCO. Bernie
was a very good example of the LORR. He was a very
about LORR's Miami contact and that the former might
have mis-represented what was said. (Consent: we can-
not positively identify BLANCO - although such an indi-
vional was listed by LORF and the DIAZ Lans as an Army

plettere.)

The LORR's most important strategies communication

is sacking for his from ROS - and who will call LORF
periodically to find out if LORR wants to transmit

trip to the US as a victory for the opposition - but
that if LORRAL returned to Cuba they will view the
refura as a trimph for CASTRO.
f. According to an 00 source Mrs. Katherine TAAFE will be
