Mleni Besch, Fiorida
1. DOREROSE and DI USALDO arrived by taxi at the Sands
Local at approximately 2330 hours and in the lobby passed the
Subject, has traveling compenion, Mra. DI SILVA (cother of
Drasilian charge CANBOA) and Mr. & Mre. Kurt PIASTERRE (See
Contact Report dated 3 May 1963) with whom they had spent the
evening. While the two case officers were negotiating rooms
with the deat clerk, VASLOUCH/2 made a point of asking for her
key which indicated her room number and the case officers were
therefore able to get rooms on the floor just below here,
(NOTE: Our contacts with VASLOUCH/2 were dependent upon the
amount of time she could spend away from her unvicting travoling
compansione.) As previously arranged, DI UBALDO vent to the
Subject's hotel room at 0700 hours the next morning and brought
her to his room where the debriefing took place. At the out-
set DOREMOS was introduced as Millian Clino and it was explained
that DI ISALDO was moving out of the operation. This initial
meeting which lasted until 0900 hours was confined primarily to
two copies; one, VASLOUCH/1's context with and cultivation of

VALLEJO, a key advisor to CASTRO and two, the recent social
cultivation of the VASLOUCHES by an officer of the Soviet Embassy.
The facts developed on the second subject are as follows: For
several years VASLOUCH/2 had been contacted at the Brasilian
Embassy by Velantine S. LOCUIINOV, an attache at the Soviet
Embassy. These contacts took place every two or three months
when LOCUIINOV would bring vies requests from his Embassy. The
last of these business contacts was in February of this year.
On 27 April, while VASLOUCH/2 was in Bessico Cty, LOCUIINOV
phoned the Brasilian Embassy asking for VASLOUCH/2 and when
informed that she was not in, requested her home phone number
(amlisted) from the girl answering the phone, Hilda BOLIVAR
(girl friend of SANCHEZE). The girl refused to give out the
number. et 1000 on 1 May, LOCUIINOV apparently having acquired
the number from the consualer list, called VASLOUCH/2 at her
home caly to be told that VASLOUCH/2 was working that mersing
at the Brasilian Embassy. He finally got VASLOUCH/2 on the
telephone at 1600 hours and stated that the date was an
important holiday for him and that he vlehad to visit the
VASLOUCHRS with his family to bring a imall present for VAZLOUCH/2.
LOCUIINOV and family arrived at VASLOUCH/2's home at 1800 hours
and stayed until 2100 hours. The prefillment was a bottle of "Red

Moscow' parfume. The evening was confined to small talk. On
3 May, LOCUINOV again called and made a dinner date with
VASLOUCH/2 and her husband for 10 May. LOCUIINOY and wife pickod
up the VASLOUCHES in their private car and the evening (2130 -
0030) was speat at the Capri Restaurant. Because of the noise
from the floor ahov, again little of note was discussed. The
cost of the meal was approximatoly $10. At the restaurant,
LOCUINOV invited the VASLOUCHES to attend a reception and showing
of the Soviet passenger plane, TU-114, to be held at 12:30 an
14 May. VASLOUCH/2 did not attend because she was leaving for
Miami. When VASLOUCH/1 cielephoned VASLOUCH/2 in Mien on 17 May,
he mentioned, in Geeman, that Valamine had again dropped by.
From these contacts with LOCUINOV the following had boan
observed by VASLOUCH/2. No is approximately 32 years old,
speats flisent apanish with just a alight asecent and a little
English. No has been in Cubs three years and was flunr in
Spanish when he arrived. He is approximately 6 feet tail, weighs

Moscow. Also that VASLOUCH/1 had recently been back to Finland.
One thing that stayed in V/2's mind was that in conversation
with LOCUINOY he referred on three occasions to the possibility
that their daughter might vary well marry a Russian, a point
that eight relate to any operational approach LOCUINOY may
make to the VASLOUCHES. V/2 stated that LOCUINOY was the only
one that had ever come to the Brasilian Embassy regarding visas.
She also stated that over the past years ahe has called his
office four or five times regarding visas and has never been
able to reach him. V/2 also recalled that during their outing
at the Capri Restaurant LOCUINOY stated that he was planning to
rent a beach house and was looking forward to the VASLOUCHS
spending time with him and his wife these during the summer
sments. V/1 inquired as to the whereabuts of the former
PRAVDA correspondencet, Borovsky, and was told he was in Moorev.
2. The Finnish Ambassador in Haahington has been kept
informed en LOCUINOY's advances toward the SLOUCHES. His only
cossment at this point was that "they are after something. " V/2
has advised CAMPOA whose reastion has been to encourage the
relationship in hopes of acquiring some political information
from LOCUINOY. The Finnish Ambassador also
stated in his telephone conversation with V/2
in Himei that he had requested that the SLOUCHES instaltation
be elevated and given diplosate: status. He expressed surprise
that apoppy of his letter to the Cuban Foreign Ministry had not

been recelved by V/1 and promised a special dellvery copy of
it to V/2 in Mical. Relating to this, V/2 stated to the C/O
that in one of V/1's meetinge with CORCHA of the Foreign Office,
COSOHA stated that he was requesting Malsinki to raise the
status of ite representation in Havana and to post a charge
there. V/2 was told by the C/O that after checking with
Headquarters concerning LOCUIHOVI's background, specific guidanee
on how to bandle the relationship would be forthcoming.
3. From SANCHEZ, V/1 elicited road building information
which he had put on an overlay which was passed by V/2 (sent
to SAS Reports). SANCHEZ had invited V/1 co Oriente Province
with him in the more future to see some of his projects.
Reluctantly we inatructed V/2 to tell V/1 to turn down the
invitation on grounds of ill health but to leave the way open
for a similar invitation in the future. It was thought that
this was best until we could assess LOUGHIVO's interest in the
VASLOUCHES. V/2 also passed the war nameo V/1 had assigned to
his principalcontents and a diagram of the Brasilian Zebassay
including measurements of the out building which DI UBALDO had
discussed with V/2 in Meeico City relating to its possible use
as a dead drop. A pamphlet opcited, List of Exports and
Imustita of Cuban Foreign Trade Katerurines, also was passed.
(Sent to SAS/Raports.) 1 list of inmum passed showed numbers
and some other data on these passunges! which had departed
Cuba in two Cubana flight to Brami 111r the purpose of picking
up the Cuban sports team in Brazil (hunt to SAS/RE).

4. On 19 May DI LEALDO returned to Washington, DORENOSG
met with V/2 on. 20 May, from 0700 - 0900 hours. At this meeting,
V/2 was given the KEYHAY sterile phone number and told that all
future contacts should be made to Cline using this number. She
was also given our initial assessment of the significance of
LOCUIROV's approach (the traces from Headquarters had still not
been received). In our opinion thore were three possibilities
and two of them were unlikely. Firet, LOGUINOV's approach
could be an innocent one and be merely for the purpose of
establishing a friendship, an extension of this thought would
be the possibility of this interestifig in defeating. Given the
age difference in the two couples and weighing other factors,
this was considered unlikely. The second possibility is that
the Soviets have been alerted, possibly by V/1's open code
eable to Finland, to the SLOUGIES possible involvement with
the Americas. This also is unlikely for hed this bean the case
the Last thing the Soviets would wish to do would be to alert
the SLOUCHES to the fact that they won: and suspicion and
bask
therefore bring about a cut An their untivithea: (COUPENT:
LOGUINOV's sudden and fairly intensiva utilization effort has
had just this effect.) The third andi use likaly possibility
is thet the Soviets are cultivating V/1? for use as a penetration
of the Brazilian Embassy. V/2 accessfient the case officer's

assessment as valid and in keeping with her own throughts. She
vess told that finel guidance on this matter would be given her
at e subsequent meeting to be held in the afternoon after
DORINOSE had received the Headquarters traces. The discussion
than went to the communications.
6. When the Subject stated that hor husband was unable
to bring out either the pads or his instructions on how to use
the pads which had been given him in New York, it was decided
to issue two reduced size OTP's concealed in a shaving kit.
5/M instructions on the use of the OTP would be passed by
BARKER in Hexico City. She was told that BARKER would be in
the lobby of the Hilten Hoid in Mexico City at 0730 on 23 Hay.
When they have recognized each other abo should follow his from
the Hotel. IG BARKER is unable to make the coatact he is to
telephone her later in the day using the name BHTO. Subject was
cold that we were unable to come up, as yet, with an extended
deal-carphene set which oho had requested, but this vould be
available for the nest contact later in the summer.
7. Tostard the and of the meeting, Subject passed trans-
lations abo had made of motes given her by V/1 which he believed
to be of intelligenee interest. They are included as Attachment
A). Unfortumately, DOREROSE was capable to review these reports
with her but she was pursued bu tenn over Finnish language
states and the carben copy of V/111 latter to his ambassador
(a traselation of which is Atzusiment B). The C/O requested
the name of a person in Holsing's who veald have reason to write

of the incoming s/w in the future vould be written in Finnish,
mailed in Heloinki, and ostensibly come from this person.
Subject stated that sha would depart Mismi by Guest Airlines
on 22 May 1963. The meeting was conducted hurriedly and
necessarily fied concluded at 0900 hours. Plans were made for
the Subject to return for a brief contact with DORKEOSE between
1430 and 1600 hours after finding some excuse to get away from
har companion.
8. Subject was unable to break away from her companion
