MEMORANDUM FCR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Teleahone Conversation between AMBIDDY-1 and
Martin Ferrer
DATE
: 30 June at 1100 hours
1. Upon Erneido Olive's request, AMBIDDY-1 went to
meet with him last night. At the meeting Oliva mentioned
to A-1 that he (Oliva) was receiving the backing of KUBAK
and the Pentagon and implied A-1 was also receiving aid
Oliva stated that he has met with Alfredo Rodemeyer, the same
Rodemeyer that both of them had met early last year. A-1
was asked to have been asked to do death of Kennedy and he
no longer had contact with any other party. He said.
According to Oliva, Mr. Rodemeyer spoke badly of some of the
personnel in A-1's organization, e.g., Antonio Iglesias.
Oliva mentioned that he had talked with Thomas Mann
and his father, who had been pregnant within the coming week
to receive support for his convention. He said.
A-1 told Oliva he had no objection to the conventional
warfare plan and that he would morally support Oliva in
liberating Cuba. However, he would continue in his own
little way with his unconventional war. According to A-1,
he made it clear to Oliva that he was not receiving OCTOKE
backing.
2. A-1 expects to leave on 1 July for Costa Pica
tomorrow. He again mentioned that Adelaide will soon be
leaving the United States. A-1 commented he does not expect
to visit the United States as often as he has done in the
past. A-1 asked that Enrique and Mr. Archer clearly under-
stand that he does int'nd to keep his word concerning the
changes he has mentioned to us at the last two meetings.

ANNUALD'S REKING IN NEW ORLEANS, 24 Jum. 1964
SUBJECT: AMRIDDY-1's Image and Philescophy
1. AMRIDDY-1's prevercetation with his political image
abene thre, when he inquired whether we suspected him of
dictatorial leaings. we replied, in effect, that we enter-
tained such seepicions and inelined toward taking his protesto-
tions of liberalium and laissez faire with a heavy dege of
salt. Oune in power, he would treat the 1940 as a serpe of
paper and run the country along autortorian lines. Tattered
by his implied inclusion in the line of secession, A-1 only
voiced and diecent.
2. Commenti Censidering the exigencies of setmeny
which deny us much opportunity, let alone leverage in shaping
ANTRD-1's political philosophy, we have conveyed to him in a
variety of ways that we do not particularly caree may
the other, that we do not fanny him as a chesen instrument outside
the periphery of ANROLD and - that by extension - we have
in
intention of promoting any political aspirations he may harker.
to have also left me doubt in his mind that we vioe his per-
frowee in the ANOROLD driver's seat rather than any philose-
phical stroms of cencicenses, as a dependable game of how
he would be performing in a pesition of political responsibility.
: We pointed out to ANRIDDY-1 that Liberatien say would
find a prestrate, bankrupt and exhausted people, many to death
c politico and propaganda, serving to be left alone for a table
to ceiliest its theughts. There would be re political infre-
sivebure on which to build and prematurely called general elections
would merely serve to abuase the sternory of perilamentary doces
crasy even more. For a while Rt least, a beign and just exerentia
would have to restore Cuba's equilibrium and permit here to rebalid
the 12est totiens without which a demerory cement properly feustion.
S.


In this context, we mentioned estimates expressed by AMBIDY-1
on Vessuela IV deprecating largescale revenge during the re-
cess truction phase and veiced hope that weold do his share to
see these mobile ideas put into effect.

AMOIBED MEETING IN NEW ORLEANS, 74 June 1964
SUBJECT: ANDIA PADRON y Crus - Decision to Hove Her to
Hiearegus
1. Drawing liberally upon data supplied in UFGA 16312,
we reminded AMBIDDY-1 about our misgiving regarding his
association with Adelaide PADRON y Crus. He cormeded aware-
ness of some of the rumors circulating about her past private
life and stated that he had satisfied himself that they were
unfounded. We injected that we knew that Jose Nole Resales
has been asked to do some investigating and had given Adelaide
Padron a elem bill of health. We also happened to knew that
KOLE was source of the true story and for reasons of his eum
had decided to withheld it from AMBIDDY-1. We inquired that
he knew about Senora SLLE and he commented that ehen had been
a "had ummen". We observed that the "had been" was open to
question.
2. AMBIDDY-1 avvered that he had listened to a telephone
conversations between Adelaide and ber former husband, Roger
Najes Lavernie, in which the latter had admitted that the story
check his having acted under higher crdere when carrying
Adelaide were unfunded. AMBIDDY-1 also charged the ear-benbamed
of having tried to notice his wife to participate in ergies,
but that Adelaide had refused to do so.
3. As regards Adelaide's alleged illicit relationship
with en-Fresident BATISTA, AMBIDDY-1 simply declared the charge
to be unfounded. Adelaide did know Carlos CANTILLO Omeless
the was an old friend of the family. She also had met en-Presci-
cent JINNKE, but nothing of a expressing nature had caused.
A. When asked thatther it was true that Adelaide had intro-
ceed his to several prominent Vennamales, he denied while and
stated that introductione had been made by Silvin GARTIA, a
erested childned friend of AMBIDDY-1.

3. Our query why Adelaide, if be had ANBIDDT-1's
interests at heart, appeared to have qualms about owning up
in respect to past events, was parried by ANBIDDT-1 by claiming
that Adelaide was of course aware of all these rumors and had
warred him of possible political embarrassment.
6. Evaluating UFCA 16512 on the basis of sur talk with
ANBIDDT-1, we conclude that its main source has a high bating
average. At least there appears to be a hard core of truth to
practically all allegations made, to the extent we ware able
to check them out. We would venture the gress that, despite
his protestations to the contrary, AMBIDDT-1 is quite conversant
to the world's past history, but can see no practical gain in
no telling why any reason that an avoual of intent to marry
a woman whose anteces are not sent as described, would seriously
bishish his image and that by pleading ignorance now he can, if
things should get out of control, allwaye strike a pose of injured
income and elicit a "here but for the Gruage of God ge T're
section from his PAPRIKE associates
7. Agreement that all interested parties would benefit by
moving Adelaide's abodes from the VAYA area to Nicaragua was
reached on the basis of ANBIDDT-1's expenses of our flat state-
ment that we view Adelaide as a postencased board to AMOKED's and
EUREK's security. He based this reasenior of the
estions that Adelaide had become all but completely privy to
everything that was going on in AMORID and that her discretion
Lift a great deal to be desired. We drew us denial from ANBIDDT-1
when stating that Adelaide had becees writing of the WAVE training
seures for ANBIDDT-1 and that she presumably hew about KIMAKE
support for AMORIDL. We referred to Adelaide's lecibm associates,
which is being starting that as expected her of holding charter membership
in that connection is that contained by name Aide FERZ and Lucie CARD.
When the latter was labored to be in
Adelaide's emulsite enffidence, AMORIDDT-1 was
for ressees difficult to fachem almost dimeny. We conclude
stressing the importance of breaking up Adelaide's airele of
associates and confidenta as an indispensable pregracelite for
containing the threat her access to infermation we consider
classified respresents and asked AMORIDDT-1 to make sure that no
mamder of this group would fellow her to Hisacragua.

3.
We made no attempt, which in any case would have been
vain, to break up the relationship between AMBIDDY-1 and
Adelaide. We apelegized to him for involving ourselves in
matters of a private and intimate nature which unfortunately
were beginning to impinge upon OUTOKE security interests.
ANSIDOT-1 in turn made it clear that he thinks he is in love
and that separation is not in the cards. We dropped the
lesse by assering AMBIDDY-1 that the day would come when things
could be seen in better perspective and that he could depend on
the net to gloat ce reined him that we had told him so.
9. We mentioned offhand that wo assumed that Adelaide
had all the papers necessary to effect her departure from
FEBANE. AMBIDDY-1 replied that she had not been able yet to
get the necessary papere. We simply commentes that she should
ask for them.

Chief of Station, MIWAVE

Deputy Chief, WH (Special Affairs)
TTPIC/AMWORLD--Idantity
REFS: A. UFGA 16512, 15 June 1984
B. DIR 31528
1. Chief, WH requests that an investigation of the truth of
some of the allegations made in Ref A report be held in abeyance
pending determination whether Subject in fact has decided to leave
performance for Nicaragua.
3. Headquarters continues to be interested in additional data
regarding the house in the WAVE area which AMENDIT-1 intends to
purchase in the name of Mile Meeor.
3. If it should turn out that the conditions described in
Ref report are not drastically remedied and continue to pose a
fostering threat to the security of AMFORLD, your station may have
to be requested to investigate. In the meanwhile, we are hopeful
that Subject's removal from the WAVE area will serve to attentuate
this matter.
4. Thanks to def A report, we vere able (without going into
too much sordid detail) to put AMENDIT-1 on notice that we view his
association with Subject in the WAVE area as a potential threat to
AMWORLD's and UKARK's security and that the political scandal
potential of the existing situation is equally formidable. We
also said, "We have been the most important, but we have
latest setting in Panama City, that he rove the center of his illicit
affair to Managua where it vould be easier to contain unpleasant
repersecuions than in the WAVE area. We urged AMENDIT-1, and he
grained to heed our advice, that ne dot permit subject to take
along to Kacaragua members of her present entourage, salging out
Industry 00 of Ref A as a particular case in point.
5. It should be stressed that the government in his
case is a "good deal of the subject in pure as driven asse and
hahly maliaged and that he has a ready explanation for every "rumor."
It vould have been unwise to attempt cercing him into discontimizing
his affair with Subject and most likely he would not have yielded to
any pressure. Hence, we had no choice but to settle for the pre-
posed move to Nicaragua which represents a palliative at best.

Debriefing of Russell E. Sambora in Vash., D.C. 16 June 1964
SUBJECT: DMJK Engineers
Sambora reported he not with AMGIDOT/1 at the Mims
airport on 5 June 1964 for a brief discussion of organi-
zational changes. After their talk, A/1 requested Sambora
accompany him to the airport hotel to act as interpretor
with an American engineer (possibly DMJM). Sambora did
not recall the name of the engineer but that the engineer
had stated the airstrip in Niagara vould cost somewhere
in the vicinity of a million dollars. According to
the area, A/1 simply listened to the proposal and said he
would take the matter under advisement.

ANSONAL Meeting in Niami, 28 June 1964
SUBJECT: Photographs of Adelaide Padran
1. During a Lull in the meeting I took ANBIDDY-1
aside (as instructed) and told him it would be best
for all concerned to take Adelaide out of PEPRIINE as
he had suggested. I mentioned to him there is a groving
number of reports on Adelaide finding their way to
Washington, making it increasingly difficult for us to
protect his rear.
2. I then cannually mentioned to him that we had
received some eleceme photographs which have caused us
the fact that the most important of the Washington
that are beginning to have some misgivins and most
ANBIDDY-1 (actually this story is national).
3. I nected the recert concerning the photographs
upert ANBIDDY-1. "Do you mean incorel pictures, Martin?"
ANBIDDY-1 inquired. I moded and to avoid his asking
further questions about the pictures, I reminded him of
his previous that Lucia Cass. Natcha d'Angle (AMBIDDY-1
denied knowing her) and Alda Perez Peso would not follese
Adelida to Mckargan.
4. During the rest of the meeting AMBIDDY-1 appeared
to be somewhat dejected and preoccupied. It is the opinion
to the co's attending the setting that this van attributed

information that we had not divulged to him. AMBIDDY-1
then inquired 11 he could see the photographs. I replied
that it was our fooling that it would serve no useful
purpose other than to satisfy the following: the summary
as he had promised to take Adelaide out of the country,
there was no sense in rubbing salt into the wound. Further-
more, we did not wish to reveal our sources to AMBIDDY-1.
I would both be and I know that photographs could be
fabricated. The most important difference in the use of
doing just this. AMBIDDY-1 again asked that I inform
BICROOY7 that he is interested in seeing the pictures.
In order to drop the entire subject, I promised AMBIDDY-1
I would pase the message to BICROOY7.
6. RECHROY7 believes that this (national) interventione
jurred AMBIDDY-1 out of his complacent assumption that we
lack substantial information to back up our claim that
we would have to be given to the U.S. Government.
Also, hopefully, he may now have been put on guard and
may take adequate precautions against blackmail of himself
or Adelaide which we consider a major threat to the security
of Arealis. If in future meetings AMBIDDY-1 should revert
to the U.S. Government, we would not have to be given to
state that they were promptly destroyed but that their also
being in the possession of potential blackmailers can never
be ruled out. AMBIDDY-1 should be reminded of his assurance
that there is immediately if such blackmail attempts are made
to
sue may need our help in warding them off. As has
our assurance that we would not use the cropping up of
such differences to remind his of his failure to need our

1. Without impugning ANBIDDT-1's right to purchase
a
some vo advised him that many derogatiry reports have
for theed our cars concerning his purchase of a home and
cigarette. The price of this pack to set the record straight
and thereby be in a better position. The price of this pack
runors. A-1 said he understood and it was evident A-1
did not take it (the inquiry) as a personal affront.
During a break in the meeting A-1 vent home to obtain the
necessary data on the house. Within a few hours A-1
returned with the information plus a blueprint of the
house.
2. A-1 stated the only house be owna is the one
in which he and Adelaide are now residing. This house
is leasted at 1370 N. E. 85 street, Miami, Florida.
The original downpayment was $6,500. The monthly pay-
ment on the house is $230. The funds for the downpayment
were obtained from
a. His own personal bank account ($4,000).
b. Adelaide contributed money she had received
from an autemable accident ($1,000).
c. The balance was borrowed from Sinte Mean ($1,500).
A-1 added that the money borrowed from Aorland and
loss was paid back to them. According to A-1 the house
is valued at $30,000. A-1 was asked who the house was
not registered in his name. A-1 replied this was done
to prevent rumes from starting as to where he had gotten
the money. For this reason the house is reautered in
this name of Antonio Bana (A-1's bodyguard). As seen as
Aislada departure for Mianragua, A-1 intends to leame the
house to Bana for $150 a month.

AMWORLD Meeting in New Orleans, 24 June 1964
SUBJECT: AMTUN-19 or Nice Guys Finish Last
1. HOS conclusion that AMTWOULD interests would best be
served by not opposing the termination of liaison contacts
with AMTUN-19 was prompted by some of the following con-
siderations:
a. AMBIDOT-1's obvious displeasure with the existing
relationship, as evidenced by his rather pointed obi-
servations about the corrupting effects of such contacts
ca subordinate levels. The fact that such contacts provide
the same information insight into those AMWORLD affairs
which AMBIDOT-1's also has been previously a
factor, but not an overriding one. What results in the
AMBIDOT-1 is- - the laima--that factionalism draws suste-
mance from working level liaison between Cubans and
Amesiana except in those rare instances where the
loyalty of the Cuban representative is beyond avail.
AMBIDOT-1's lack of confidence in AMTUN-19's
loyalty. Any position has been all along that AMBIDOT-1
is the most important factor for the worker's merit
trust and who doesn't. To dispute his detail, did
etamangle HUARKK into intra-AMWORLD power polities with
no adequate basis for intelligent judg^nt. Kither we
would be aware of the right of co-determination on all
personal activities. We would be a groundgrounds are
unambiguous on that score. We do not consider the
except in those instances where our opinions are
specifically elicited, as in the field of background
dissociation. We have inference bear upon the issue of
loyalty to AMBIDOT-1's, some AMBIDOT-1 withdraws
his confidence from a co-vourer we have no log to stand
on in persisting that we have the right to consider a
particular individual our choosing intrestment in the field
of liaises.
d. AMTUN-19's dual role as a ranking functionary
of AMWORLD and the Number Two Man in AMTUN. Since we
have reason for believing that a dichotomy has been
opening up between AMWORLD and AMTUN's old guard (to

which AMTUN-19 belongs), liaison with AMTORLD conducted
through AMTUN-19 ipso facto involves KUBARK in factional
stifle. We recall that some of the major troubles be-
tween the 1970s and 1971. The 1972s were the most
from the interference of political commisares. Without
derogating from the importance of the ideological
component in the struggle against AMTHOQ, in any showdown
of the 1970s. The story command and the political functionary
corps, it behovorably has been the most important role in
former unless the points at issue manifestly implicate
PEPRIKE security. Under AMWORLD groundrules KUBARK
supports AMBIDDY-1 as the commander of an unconventional
warfare instrument, not an exile organization, let alone
the ideology and aspirations which animate it.
d. The AMTUN opposition group represented by AMFUK-15
clearly desires a share in the decision-making processes
of the 1970s. The 1970s and AMFUK-1. While they pay
lip service to the prinapile of an American community
purely military affairs, in the final analysis it would
be impossible to keep the two aspects apart. Any con-
cessions on KUBARK's part to the pretensions of the
AMTUN opposition would confront KUBARK with intangibles
in the form of occult pressures brought to bear upon
an integral 1 whose impact we could not possibly gauge or
c.
ANTUN disidenco flourishes in the KVE area,
whereas AMHOLD's center of gravity reate in Central
America. Unless AMBIDDY-1's stewardship is unimpeded by
AMFUK fastionalism, AMHOLD's performance is bound to
seffer since AMBIDDY-1's preoccupations will always
retain & focus on his WAVE area backyard.
1. The impression that AMFORDL may be disintegrating
is fed by intel which essentially reflects WAVE area
under the 1970s. The 1970s and AMFORDL have the
imitation in the camps about which we are, as a matter
of fact, relatively uninformed. By striving to insulate
AMFORDL against the vagaries of WAVE area bickering and
stifle, the AMFORDL picture is bound to move into clearer
focus and any shortcomings for which AMBIDDY-1 should be
reduced. The 1970s and AMFORDL were designed to
debilitating effects of AMTUN intrinsic and importance
cannot possibly be blamed upon BUKARK edge its links with
AMFORDL-1 have been severed.

g. An emasculated politician.1 apparatus in the WAVE
area will deprive AMBIDDY-1 of all excuse to divide his
time between Central America (where he belongs) and the
WAVE area.
h. The tawdry aftermath of the ZENON 11 raid can
justly be blamed if not on ANYUN, at least on AMBIDDY-1's
political representation in the WAVE area. With that
results, the WAVE are eliminated, one of the main
sources of ODTOKR discomfort will have been effectively
dislocated. Impending changes should at least eliminate
the WAVE area.
1. Should there be further unpleasantness in the
WAVE area, KUBARK will, once contacts with ANYUN-19 have
ceased, have a base for plausible denial of responsibility
for not preventing it.
j. If we are to believe certain not altogether
unbiaseded reports, AMBIDDY-1, through his mistress
Adelida PADRON, has become linked with the exile demi-
made which moves on the fringes of common crime and
the first time. We have been given a "suspicious" lista's
reine. While ANYUN, and particularly AMYUN-19, may to
see extent serve to counteract and slow down there trends,
they are obviously unable to halt them entirely. Hence,
what little benefit we could have derived from a tie-in
case? We have been given a "suspicious" list.
Short of an enduring political compromise between con-
flicting viewpoints, which we don't consider within the
realis of practical politics, any solution which keeps
AMBIDD-1 out of the WAVE area and close to his command
post, seven AMWOLD and hence KUBARK interests.
h. ANWORLD in WAVE area had become a breeding ground
for rumors and beyond reasonable doubt a valuable source
of the "suspicious" list. For ANTHUO's agents. By

Regarding this fundamental issue he and KUBARK may be at odds.
In serving as our principal working level liaison contact, he
also said that he has been the most important and most
political power vis-a-via AMEJDY-1, a fact that has obviously
not escaped AMBIDY-1's notice. Without impugnng ANYUW-19's
good faith, we have reason for believing that on occasion he
has been the most important one, the park of KUBARK criticism or
AMBIDY-1's capabilities, he has been the most important and
it appears, has left AMBIDY-1 with the completely erroneous
impression that we vere taking sides in the factional dispute
involving ANYUN, in essence backing ANYUN-19 against AMBIDY-1.
The most important, however, is that he has been the most

counter to KUBARK's oft stated position that personnel matters
are in the same way. He has been the most important, may
have reinforced AMBIDY-1's suspicions that RAMBORA was linked
with KUBARK. A..,arrently AMBIDY-1 has not been unduly
influenced by ANYUW-19's continuous harping on the threat
posed by AMBIDY-1 (AMUW-19 was never shaken in his conviction
that AMBIRG-1 receives KUBARK support). Another bete nore

therefore ought not be blamed upon authoritarianism (without
which AMWORLD cannot conceivably prosper) but upon a leadership
gap in AMBIDDY-1's personality makeup which even "democratic
centralism" couldn't correct or cure.
4. In assessing the prospective consequences of a cessa-
tion of contact between AMTUM-19 and KUBARK, we shall have to
take into account that he is fully cognizant of the fast that
KUBARK supports AMWORLD. The relationship that has existed
before is known to him in all its facets.

are known to him:

that they are somehow 11:ed with EBARKE:

what he knows to unauthorised persons, is difficult to assay.
Should be in honest conviction reach the conclusion that he was
shunted aside because KURABK considered him an obstacle to
establishing full sway over AMWORLD, he could easily rationalise
a betrayal. Other "ideological" considerations could be adduced
by him to justify actively opposing KUBARK. Whatever he may
be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to put by
design. We have weighed and discarded the possibility of
neutralising him through recruitment. This would not work if
our reading of his personality is correct. We can think of a
number of deterrents, out of KUBARK's reach, which will probably
be the most important. The growing down the gauntlet. To
prove the emity of both AMWORLD-1 and KUBARK would be an act
of defiance of which we consider. THE UMR-19 incapable. Besides,
AUTUAL-19 strikes us as an individual imbued with a sense of base
deceasy and of Christian morality.
6. In balance we doubt whether ANTUAL-19 is going to pose
a major threat to the security of AMWORLD. In any case, HOS
decision to accuse to AMBIDTV-1's desires on working level
liaison, even if it entails a rupture in relations with ANTUAL-19,
which is a very good way to make it possible. The problem is
trouble and inflict damage if this be his intent. Should this
come to pass, however, it would be unfair to shift the entire
blame state AMBIDTV-1. While we can hardly applaud the glaring
and unaided and unaided. The problem is to be a new
affair, while his motives in dispeaming with ANTUAL-19's ser-
vices may not be entirely honorable, and while MOLB, his main
source on the ANTUAL chal, is self serving and questionable to
pafit alldly, the fact remains that the final decision was
UNABK' as much as it was AMBIDTV-1's.

DATE : 22 June 1984 at 1130 hours
1. AMBIDDY-1, sounding somewhat tired and with a
bad cold, mentioned that he would like to advance the date
of the meeting to 23 June 1984. A-1 advised there are
some administrative matters which have to be resolved in
the Qusa and other problems in Miami that he would like
to discuss with "Enrique". A-1 then intends to return

Martin) would hold the meeting with him on 23 June 1984
and that Carl could talk with him and AMJAVA-4 on the
meaning of 24 June. A-1 was advised that this is a routine
meeting in which many items would be discussed, e.g., the
Miami reorganization that A-1 had mentioned. There was
nothing of a critical nature,
3. The ADELAIDA arrived in Monkey Point as they
were leaving for the States (21 June).
4. A-1 inquired if there were any outstanding
problems. Martin evasively replied that he preferred
not to discuss it over the phene. A-1 then asked if we
intended to discuss A-19 and "his friends". The under-
signed mentioned we would be disposed to talking about
anything which A-1 feels is important.
5. A-1 stated he expects to leave for Central America
by the end of 1001' works.

DISPATCH
Deputy Chief. WH/SA
Chief of Station. JEWAY
BRYANT/TYPIC/Operational/AMORID
AMOT Report
ACTION REQUIRED: None
REFERENCE: UPGA-16512 of 15 June 64
Transmitted herewith is additional information concerning
AMBIDDY1's home life which may be of interest to BCRHOFF.
It would be interesting to learn the origin of the recurrent
rumor that the date of the PILON raid was advanced at the
instigation of ODYORK and that AMBIDDY/1 feels himself betrayed.

SUCRE:
AMWORLD--Possible Basis for Entente between AMBIDDY-1 and SAMBORA
ACTION REQUIRED BRIEEMERS
1. We advised SAMBORA at a Washington meeting with him,
16 June 1964, that from the way things look to us he had painted
himself into a corner from which he could not extricate himself.
Another error was to have permitted someone like MOLE to block
his path to the AMWORLD hierarchy. This in retrospect, however,
is all water over the dam.
2. If SAMBORA is to perform his functions as we first con-
ceived thes he should go to AMBIDDY-1 and arrive at a new understanding.
SANBORA was informed that we intend to meet AMBIDDY-1 before
SANBORA returns to the other. This meeting we intend to state in
the same terms that the security of the organization is in a
deplorable condition. This perhaps may have the effect of placing
SANBORA is a more favorable bargaining position.
3. We counseled SAMBORA to negotiate a hard contract which
would encompass at least the following terms:
a. He would not work under nor be responsible to MOLE
but only to the highest echelons of AMWORLD hierarchy.
b. Full access to all files, bases, information needed
to perform a professional job.
c. The complete and unhesitating support of AMBIDDY-1 in
all security matters.
If an is unwilling to accept these terms or offers any restrictions
or conditions SAMBORA has our permissios to turn in his badge
and bid AMBIDDY-1 a fond adieu:

SUBJECT
: ANTROLD.Reviee of Deficiencies
1. A meeting with AMENDY-1 has been called for weekend
of 27 June in order to revier certain deficiencies in ANWORLD
management and, in this context, convee to BEHIV-1 exper
sions of Chief, WH's serious cigns or ve a]ifestations of
insufficient leadership in giving direction to and exercising
supervision over the ANWOLD effort and the personnel assigned
to it.
2. In reviewing events of the preceding twelve months,
it will be possible to balance praise and strieture. What
has happened, it appears, is that after a flying start, the
project is beginning to feel the effects of a devolution of
GIA controls and that deficiencies in the quality of ANWILDY-1's
leadership now appear in more striking relief.
3. In relating to AMEND-1 our views regarding the
state of ANWORLD affairs, ve propose to dwell on folleving
aspects:
a. Management Slippages, carrying over into the
field of Finances. Still no capable administater. We
will be able to develop a new strategy to develop
other than requiring receipts. Double whether any kind
of budgeting still being enforced aince ve converted to
straight and fixed subaidising. Faint odor of corruptica.
b. Quality of Perocemel. Leadership breckt poorly
staffed. (lues program's Inception, reorutment drive

My is it good people do not flock to ANWORLD's colors,
especially after Pilon? Among reasons most frequently
mentioned, AMBIDOT-1's alleged unwillingness to delegate
authority and tendency to surround himself with dross of
exile community which repels good elements. Sierra and
Castillo, also above average, have already quit.
The follow: Action. Other than what taken in hand
by ANBIDOT-1 personally, media output of ciplorably low
quality. AMBIDOT-1 himself gooed after Pilon.
d. Operational Planning. June performance below
for despite WAVK training and Jenkins' consultation.

reception committees presumably lying in wait. Prelis-
nary survey indicates likelihood proposes operation
widely known in ANWORLD Miami circles. Leakage, there-
fore, not necessarily attributable to high-level penetra-
tions, but hypothesis much penetration exists in quite
operated.
Needg: Headquarters will come discussing
operational plans inside U. B. and insist on passing
intel abroad.
AMBIDOT-1 has consistently ignored our advice
to Batten down batches and prepare for major CIS
emslught, especially post Pilon. His no-called intel
section staffed with camp-followers and headed by a thus.

1. Female situation. Focr, except maybe among
candat cadres. ANUS-11 toying with ides to quit.
Others may follow suit. Charisma no substitute for
managerial ability. AMBIDOT-1's disoluteness setting
poor example.
g. "Adelida." Clear indications she hemecke his

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORO
SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation between AMYUN-19
and Raul Hernandez
DATE : 18 June 1964 at 0930 hours
i. ANYUR-19 called to say that he had passed the
message to AMYUDY-1 that GUERTLEB had given him
stating that the Consejo is interested in meeting
A-1. A-18 was advised to tell A-1 the meeting would
be preferable at the end of next week, 28 or 27 June
in New Orleans, whichever date suits A-1. A-19 also
mentioned that he had informed A-1 that there was
too much loose talk in the organisation.
2. A-19 has forwarded to the Consejo the letter
regard to the committee. Also accompanying this
letter is a request for funds to purchase uniforms,
tools, bedding, etc. for the camps which according to
A-19 has been previously discussed.
5. A-4 has asked A-19 to send the DMJM plans to
Microregusa. A-19 inquired if we knew where these plans
are. Also A-19 added he was promised the blueprints
for the landing field. The undersigned mentioned that
Dick was not in the office and if A-19 would call
back later we would have the answers for him.
4. A-19, when asked if the charter fee for the
ADELAIDA had been paid for this month, stated he did
not know if it had been sent but would check with Mess.

SEORET
DEBRIETION of Russell E. SANBORA in Washington, D.C., 16 June 1984
SUBJECT: Embesslement of Funds by Mario Delgado Escueta
1.
Sumbora reported that Delgado, who is the head
of logistics in Costa Rica, was accused of embesling
$1,000 from ANWORLD. A/1 conducted a personal investigation
of the case. The final outcome of the case: He was asked
to make restitution out of his salary until the entire
amount had been repaid.
3.
This case in point was brought up by Sambora to
illustrate that A/1 repends a great deal of his time on
relatively minor tasks which could easily be delegated
to someone else.

Dear Mr. Artime:
This is to acknowledge and to thank you for your
thoughtfulness in writing to me.
To vas very gratifying for me to mention your daring
reid on the part of Plion in my speech of May 20th.
Fulicidades. I wish you the very best in your future actions
against Castro who poses a grave mance to all of the Americas.
I am very pleased that through the Referendum the Cohen
arile community now enjoys a central voice which can serve
to co-ordinate effective anti-Castro activity. Hopefully,
my Government will turn many from its ill-advised policy of
restricting the Cohen enlles, and aid people the yourself
to liberate the Chuan people from the Castro-Comnment states.
Gershing. To that and litm as assure you of my continued support.
Please do not hesitate to write in again.
With every best wish, I -

The following is a letter from AMBIDDY-1's father
to his son.
8 June 1934
My dear son Manolin,
It has been a while since we have received a letter
from you. We are writing this to find out how you are
and we suppose you are well. Here everyone is well,
thank God.
Your mother is not writing you because I am writing
it quickly so that it can leave today.
We have presented everything since 20 March as well
as depositing the price of the fares and we are only
waiting for permission to leave which we will soon have.
When it happens we will send you a cable.
Your Godmother Rosa is sick and when I saw her today
she told me she hoped you would come to liberate her.
Therefore we know you are doing your duty. I support your
position. Don Jaime is well, thank God.
I saw Emilita and she sends her love. She also told
me to tell you to write Lino and his brother a letter
and to send it via this channel. Emilita is not going
there until you send it (the lotter) and it should be
done through this channel if it is possible.
That letter which is addressed to Conseuic du la
Campa de B, put a stamp on it immediately and mill it
so it arrives at its destination. I am staying in her
father's home and I am very anxious to help her.

forget you.

AMFORD Meeting in Bax Jusen, 7-8 June 1984
SUBJECT: Adelaide Padron y Gru
1. AMBIDT/1 himself raised this matter with
while neither James nor Ferrer were within carshot.
Quoting AMTUR/19, he inquired whether marriage with
the marriage of the family is not a person for HURAK to
terminate the existing AMFORD legal agreement.
exphatically ansvered in the negatival, going over by
now well-trodden cono more and, hopefully
making myself understood.
2. In summary, I stated we held no views one way
or the other about his intent to contract marriage.
Our concera was strictly political since we could
be able to make the same thing to be given by
from the event. True or false, certain allegations
had been made about Subject's past and there were a
goodly number of people prepared to testify to the
accuracy of those allegations, among them (I presumed)
the same thing, but it is not a political implications of
the proposed union could not put it to the him,
especially if AMTURU should get hold of it.
3. AMBIDT/1 opined that he had lived in open
sia with Subject for over a year. This was what was
bothering him and evidently some of his closest
associates, not Subject's alleged past. He needed
this relationship with Subject to maintain (literal
and other conditions) to the extent that the
considerable strain and the rare moments with Subject
alone were his sole relaxation. The issue of sin was
deeply disturbing to him, and marriage, he felt, would
resolve this situation of conflict. In order to avoid
the fact that the same thing was the same in the
thought to taking Subject with his to Nicaragua and
contrast a "secret" marriage. I did not point out to
his the evident flaws in his reasoning and merely
adverted to the great political responsibility he carries.
I made it very clear to him that a major scandal could

sink the ship. Since I did not interpose an outright
willing to be a "tobacco" at best), he will undoubtedly
profess to have convinced me of the soundness of his
headlong rush toward matrimoay and all that could entail
for our program. Short of making a sockery of autonomy,
I could not tell his any more than I did.

ARTORLE Meeting in 7-8 June 1964
SUBJECT: AMBIODT/1's Political Reporting
1. I reminded Subject that in the past we had
frequently pressed his to keep us abreast of his
political activities with particular emphasis upon
relations with the host governments in Convara' America.
The response to our urging had been increasingly
reached in the past we had the vaniahing point.
Since it was not curiosity that had been the most
for timely reporting but a desire to be of service in
protecting the rear, ve were now wondering whether
it would not be best to leave the determination whether
the most important of the fact that him rather than
continue importuning his which was to be a place
us in a slightly ridiculous position. AMBIODT/1
pleaded over-vork in excuse of his failure to provide

problem arisen and is timely signalled to us. Sillence
VII be construed by us as an indication that "all is
voll."

SUBJECT: AMBIDOT-1's Father
1. AMBIDOT-1 claims to have learned via QUANTUN 50
that his father is hiding in the home of a friend in the
Nevans area.
3. AMBIDOT-1 semier sent vord that he is in touch
with some old CP buddies who have offered to help his
get out of PERNINE. AMBIDOT-1 is anxious to pass a
good way to his father but not via QUANTUN 50 because of
his distance to the mother. A MENTHOL is a good
government. In this message, AMBIDOT-1 wants to suggest
to his father that he induce an "old CP" emissary to meet
with AMBIDOT-1 outside of PERNINE, e.g. in Mexico.
AMBIDOT-1 believes that the rift between AMBIDOT-1 regime
and the old CP offers unprecedented opportunities to

THE TROOPS THAT WILL OVERFLOW CASTRO ARE ALREADY IN CURA
THEY ARE THE PEOPLE THE CHEERED HIM
WHEN THEY REMISSED WITH A HERO OF
OUR IDENTIES
/Following is a translation of an interview of 'tamel Arine
by Agustin Camargo, as reported in the Spanish language maga-
zine Boh-mia Internacional, Caracas, Venezuela,? June 1984.7
Q. - Your group has initiated a new offensive against the Castro
require during the last few days in cooperation with one carried
out by other revolutionary units. Do you expect victory soon?
A. - Everyone knows when wars begin, but never when they end.
I would like to say that it will be soon, but my duty as
a leader is to prepare the people of Cuba and the Cubans in exile
for the kind of war we expect: a long, hard war, but one that
we shall win if ali Cubans pull together in accordance with their
ability.
There may be imponderable factors, "surprises" which
could bring about the fall of the tyrant; but :e must never
count on "miraoulous" solutions, on invasions that do not exist
or on organizations that will pull our chestnuts out of the fire.
Q. - Are you considering the possibility of eventually uniting
your men and resources with those of the Cuban Revolutionary
Junta or the Alpha 66 - II Front - MRP or any other unit that
may be currently carrying on the struggle inside Cuba?
A. - It's frontiers of our movement have never been closed to
anycus who wants to fight for Cuba, with the exception of totali-
tarian novements either of the right or of the left.
What we do think wise to explain is that we do not be-
lieve in politician action units in exile. We believe only in
1


14/20/00
unity of martyr'm, of sacrifice, of combat. We want the
greatest success for our sister revolutionary orsanizations,
which will never be objects of attack on our part because our
only enemy is communism.
Q. - You personally and the M.R.R. in general have always been
cited as "fairites" of certain North American groups or go-
vernmental agencies. Is that correct?
A. - I would like to have those who speak of this favoritism
answer me this question:
Do they call the Bay of Pigs episode favoritism?
Do they call the two years I spent in jail waiting to
put my back to the wall and be shot favoritism?
Do they call the state of abandonment in which the clan-
destine M.R.R. was left in Cuba after the battle of Giron Beach
favoritism?
Do they call favoritism the fact that on my leaving jail
I had to break with the Revolutionary Committee because it had
been converted into an instrument for not carrying the war to
Guba?
Do they call favoritism the fact that we have had to
leave American territory to be able to continue the struggle
against Castro?
Do they call favoritism the fact that we have to fight
a long war because we get no help from those who could make it
short?
But these campaigns of "favoritism" do not surprise me.


14/20/00
I know that International con unism cennet admit publicly that
it is being defeated by the people of little Cuba who are only
getting help from their brothers in Latin America, from God
and from their indonitable desire to be Free.
Q. - Today you talk of bringing about uprising in the forces
of the Castro regime, and you seen to trust in this as the best
way to liberate the island from Soviet and Communist domination.
Why didn't you take that position three years ago, since it was
just as valid then as now?
A. - Three years ago we took the same position as today. Just
remember that the M.R.R. was the first revolutionary organiza-
tion to rise up against the tyrant Castro to try to overthrow
him by internal action at a time when many were convinced that
fidel was a Communist but said "that it was not yet time to say
so to the people".
Remember that the first weapons for internal rebellion
were carried to Cuba by the M.R.R.
Remember that Francisco, the M.R.R. Coordinator in Cuba
was not only the cheerful organizer of the resistance but also
eventually the national coordinator of the whole clandestine
movement.
Remember that the Bay of Pigs invasion was designed to
be only the gold buckle to fasten up the stage of active re-
sistance and guerrilla activities.
Remember the long list of over 150 martyrs of the clan-
destine war of the M.R.R. which shown clearly the priority we


14/20/00
assigned at that t:le to rebellion in the 100.1 forces.
Remember that before the ande are set up
there were infiltration camps provided especially to assist
this internal rebellion.
Q. - Some international circles claim that Russia is abandon-
ing Castro, that it has agreed on this abandonment secretly
with North Arerica, and that this is visibly evident in the
gradual withdrawal of Soviet troops from the island. They add
that confidence in this agreement has caused North America to
1
"tolerate" this fresh outbreak of armed activities in the Car-
ibbean. Do you share this view?
A. - Frankly I do not believe in international pacts that are
not clear to me, and I believe much less in the willingness of
Russia to carry out its agreements: Poland, Chechoslovakia
and Hungary are historical witnesses: of Russian treachery.
As for "tolerating our activities", I cannot seapar,
because we have not asked for "tolerance" for them. It never
occurred to me to "ask permission" to die for my country.
Q. - Would you subordinate the possibilities of liberation
of your country to any advantage of an international nature
for the United States?
A. - My country's interests are greater than those of any other
nation. Any Guban who does not believe that does not deserve
to be called a Guban.
I do not believe the United States expects such a shock-
ing attitude from the Gubana. They may have many faults but


they respect the dignity of man.
This is not the first tixe we sey publicly that this
war of liberation of our enslaved Cuba must be carried on
"no matter whom it pleases, no natter whom it displeases",
since it is true that powerful nations have international
obligations to carry out and it is also true that we Cubans
h.ve our ineseapable duties to our enslaved country.
Q. - If armed action within Cuba -- guerrilla war in the
mountains and war of terror in the cities -- should, as ex-
pected produce a wave of popular uprisings both among students
and workers and in the military units of the dictatorship,
do you think that the democratic nations of the hemisphere
would come to our help? Aren't you afraid of a repetition
of what happened in Budapest?
A. - Although I am convinced that at some definite moment
they would come to our help, we cannot base our war on col-
lective assistance. We must plan our strategy as a purely
Ouban struggle from beginning to end.
Many Latin American nations have already helped us
in accordance with their ability and thanks to them we can
do what we are doing.
As for the fear of a repetition of what happened in
Sudapest taking place in Cuba, we cannot forget that Cuba
has no frontier with Russia.
Q. - Some foreign analysts and some governments have studied
8


the situation on the island and treat with Castro as if they
believed that all hope of liberation had expired. Can you tell
us scething about the internal struggle against communism?
A. - To think that all hope of liberation has expired in Cuba
is to show a complete lack of knowledge of the condition and
character of the Cuban people. The history of Cuba is a his-
tory of repeated martyrdom in search of real liberty.
I can say very little about the internal struggle that
does not affect its security. But let it be sufficient to say
that today there are guerrillas in five of the six provinces
of Cuba; that the tyrant knows about them and that he has not
been able to wipe them out because of the peasants' support
for them; that in the cities the sentiment of the workers has
begun to be mobilized toward passive resistance, and that
within the very ranks of the militia Cuban patriots are form-
ing independent cells.
a. - From the days of the Bay of Piga. you seemed to trust blind-
ly in North American material backing for your struggle. But
lately we see you shifting your interest toward Latin American
countries. Why?
A. - Actually my first glance was toward Latin America. I took
residence in Mexico where I published my book Traición (Treach-
szy) and I traveled around Latin America carrying the shout of
alarm against communism. Afterward I went to North America in
constant search of resources for the war, and although I have


never had blind confidence in anything human, because everything
that is done blindly is done badly, it is true that I had con-
fidence in North American material help. Reason: because we
were seeing it. (I do not think it was a secret to anyone where
the weapons we used in the invasion came from.) I had no soru-
ples in accepting American weapons to offect those from Russia
which Fidel Castro was receiving in gigantic shipments.
After leaving prison I lost confidence in that assistance
because since then not only have I seen none, but also I have
not seen the possibility even of getting any.
Not only has my interest switched toward Latin America,
but also my gratitude toward these people who have opened their
arms to offer us help when all doors were being closed against
us. Thanks to them we can continue the struggle.
Q. - What opinion do you think the conduct of nations like Eng-
land and France deserve, who, turning their backs on principles
they claim to hold and on moral and humane considerations, take
part in propping up Castro's bloody regime by supplying him
with credits and all kinds of financial backing?
A. - First I do set want to confuse countries with overcurrents.
Most peoples are innocent of the atrocities and treacheries of
their governments.
That kind of behavior never surprised me in the case of
the English government, as they did something even worse in
Korea where their soldiers were dyinigundar attacks from waves


14/20/00
of Chinese fro: red :enchuria while the government was selling
steel to Pelin.
In the case of the French government I was sorrowful be-
cause of the figure of Gen. DeGaulle. As a young Cuban I used
to hold in my heart the image of DeGaulle, hero of the Second
World War, leader of his country's resistance in the fight
against the foreign invader.
It was hard for me to realize that this same man would
turn his back on the principles which made him beloved by the
free world. It is unfortunate that such a brilliant career
should have been darkened at its ending.
In any case, some day Cuba will be free and those govern-
ments can be sure that, if they do not alter their conduct, they
will then receive their payment in the same historical ourrenoy
that they have passed out to our martyred people.
You and your party have been accused of being faosists, of
being a bee-hive for the Central Intelligence Agency and a
"cover" for the worst political and economic interests of our
country. What do you have to say about that?
A. - Nothing. Let my actions and my history answer the ques-
tion. Those who are going to go on saying this are the Com-
munists and the fociis: tools of communism.
I believe it would be well to recall that the M.R.R.
was the only organization at this stage of the Cuban struggle
than's, before apending its first funds for weapons, spent them
A


14/20/00
for publishing a statement of its lieology precisely because
we wanted everyone to know where we intended to go, how we
were going and why we were going there. This background state-
mont circulated throughout the underground and the exiles. It
contains our complete ideology, and the same thing is contained
in the political testament that I wrote before leaving for the
Bay of Pigs, as it also appears in my book Iarohas de Guerra y
Cantos de Tresidio (war Marches and Prison Songs), written while
I awaited death, as is clearly explained in the recent pamphlet
about my full statement to the members of the A.R.E.G.
If wishing to carry to Cuba a state of independence, li-
berty, justice, respect for the dignity of human beings; if
wishing to have the constitution of 1940 effective as long as
it is not revoked by the same people who approved it; if oppos-
ing all demagogic extremes and all totalitarian impositions;
if all this is being a fascist; then I am a fascist.
But since fascism is totalitarianism established by an
oligarchy in the name of supposed racial purity, I cannot be a
fastist.
As for the other accusations of obeying or being a cover
for unsavory interests, I challenge anyone to give me the name
of a single individual among our revolutionary directors who
has a biemish in this respect; I challenge anyone to analyze
the statistics of our martyrs; I challenge anyone to analyze
our history.
G. - Can you sum up in a few words the ideologioal base of M.R.R.


14/20/00
A. - Yes. We drean of independence with liberty, liberty with
culture, culture with bread, bread for honest work, honest work
with respect for the dignity of the human being; and all this
in a democratic regime of Latin American character and chris-
tian morality.
Q. - Would your group favor keeping some laws of the Revolution
if it is proved that they correspond to some need, or do you
think that the Fidel epoch should be swept out completely and
a fresh start made?
A. - When Fidel's regime is overthrown, Cuban needs are going
to be quite different from those of our country with the tyrant
in power. I believe the laws he made which could answer real
Cuban needs were badly conceived and directed even worse.
I believe that without fundamentally changing the 1940
constitution, which means for Guba a return to the rule of law,
it will be possible to make laws which will meet Cuban needs.
Q. - Are you opposed to the negroes?
A. - No; nor am I opposed to the whites, which means the same
thing to me. What interests us is not the color of the skin
but the color of the soul and of the ideals.
Perhaps that is why our movement is the one that has
more black brothers in its names, including the highest civil
and military positions.
Q. - Do you favor, as has been stated, establishment in Cuba
of a semi-consessional state. with open predominance of the
most conservative elements of the Catholic qllurch?
10


A. - Neither of the most conservative nor of the most liberal;
that would be "clerical'sm" and it is expressly condemned in
Pepal Encyclicals.
I personally am a Catholic and will never deny my faith,
because I have no vocation to be an aposate.
But of course, the novement is full of men of all reli-
gions and ocreds.
Certainly we shall reaffirm with the 1940 constitution
our belief in God and the necessity for Christian norality.
We believe that every child has the right to receive
preparation in whatever religion he chooses.
Q. - What will the M.R.R. do with the Rebel Army and the Mi-
litionce Cuba is liberated?
A. - Those who turn around and fight against the tyrant will
be retained in the armed forces with the same rank as before.
Those who do not will be discharged and returned to private
life if they have committed no crime, but if they have, they
will have to answer to the civil courts in normal fashion,
which will again function in Cuba in accordance with the 1940
constitution.
The only ones who have anything to fear are foreign
Communists and members of repressive agencies.
Q. - will the death penalty be maintained in Cuba?
A. - I do not favor the death penalty, but of course since
the 1940 constitution will be in force, this penalty is recog-
nized only for treason. We must end the revolutionary tribu-
11


nals and return to the rule of law.
Q. - Do you believe Cuban national interests when freed from
communism will be better served if the nation is placed in a
position of international neutrality?
A. - We shall always be an acyressive forefront of the West
against communism. We can never be neutral in a struggle in
which the destiny of civilization is at stake.
Q. - Engineer Ray and you seen to be performing parallel acti-
vities as you approach almost five years of struggle against
Castro and are apparently the two most important political
figures of our future. Could you tell us what keeps you apart?
A. - Starting from the assumption that we are fighting for a
democracy, any ideological difference between another group of
Cubans and ourselves will be resolved in the future by the Cuban
people in free elections. I do not think this is the historic
moment to talk about differences. If the regime set up in Cuba
after Fidel Castro is defeated is a totalitarism or a diota-
terahip of left or right, we shall KEEP ON USING OUR GUNS.
Q. - Why don't you take the command of Brigade 2506 and why has
it not been possible to consolidate around the brigade all the
circle elements since it is the largest group of veterans of our
war?
A. - A great many of our brothers of Brigade 2506 are already
in our ranks. The brigade could not consolidate exiles around
it because it was formed to be a military unit without politi-
cal plans; recently arrived from Communist prisons, it went to
North American army camps to continue its training. That is
18


why I left its ranks. I did not want anyone to say that I was
trying to orient the brigade politically by trying to unite
the eriles around it. Besides I thought that I was more useful
to my country in trying to carry the war inte Cuba than in re-
ceiving a training that I did not know whether I would put
in practice some day. Time has proved I was right.
Q. - What would you do, or what are you doing with the follow-
ers of Batista? Do you think this way of naming some people
who form closed blocs with persons of very dissimilar history
and interests, is real and does any good for Cuba?
A. - For me there are no Batistianos nor Priistns nor any other
discriminative "ista". I only believe in a moral classifica-
tion of men, and there are good ones and bad ones in all the
governments our country has had. The only salvation for Cuba
is to bring together all worthy and honest Cubans of all epochs,
of all social classes, of all colors, and of all ages, into a
new historical generation to consolidate our nation after the
traitor's regime has been overthrown. Poor Quba if we continue
to harbor sectarian hates and sterile diserininations:
Q. - It is said that you are an admirer of Jose Antonio Primo
de Rivera, that you are familiar with his ideology, and that
his assistants say in private that you are an Antilleen version
of him. Is this true?
A. - It is a fact that I am familiar with Primo Rivera's ide-
ology, as I am aise familiar with that of Mahatma Chandi, Rous-
seau, Roosevelt, Lenin, Hitler and all the men who for mankind's
18


good or ill have left a political philosophy to history. A
leader has a duty to understand them completely. But the ide-
ologies that are most familiar to ne are moulded in the unfor-
gettable thoughts of Jesus Christ, Marti and Bolívar.
This is the first time I hear myself called an "An-
tillean version" of Primo de Rivera. If anyone 8:78 so, it
must be in secret because I have never heard it. What I was
called once was a "fascist" when I was in prison awaiting the
death penalty; it was the traitor Fidel Castro in person.
It is possible that he has friends in exile.
Q. - What do you consider the -weakest of the Castro regime?
A. - The people, the people of Cuba, who would rather die on
their feet than live on their mues; the people who now real-
ize the total surrender to a foreign power and have seen the
complete failure of Communist doctrine. The troops that
will overthrow Fidel Castro are already in Cuba, the very peo-
ple who cheered him when they thought him the hero of our li-
berry.
The presence of Russian occupation troops in Cuba has
definitely revitalized the nationalist spirit of our country.
Q. - What will you do in case you come to govern Cuba, with
private schools, with the press and with private initiative of
an economic nature?
A. - In the first place, our fight is not for the purpose of
putting me in the government; it is to make our country inde-
pendent. But if you ask me what is my idea about what a sovern-
14


ment ought to do in Cuba in respect to these natteri, my answer
is: Regarding private education: protect it in every possible
way, and raise public education to the same level as private.
Regarding the press: liberty of the press and assistance for
the school for reporters to make Cuban newspaper men nore ef-
ficient. The Cuban :ress will educate our peoples' background
so as to definitively wash the wounds which communism has in-
flicted on the spirit of our children and young people.
Regarding private enterprise: protection for it, assis-
tance for small business, and by means of modern tar laws make
sure that business performs its social function. The United
States, Western Germany and many other countries can give us
an exact idea of what we want.
Q. - What is your final message to your exiled people in this
grave moment of history?
A. - That we cannot and must not trust in international solu-
tions nor in easy paths to our country's independence. That
we must return to the romantic spirit of our war of independence,
to that difficult, self-sacrificing, hard war of a Marti col-
lecting pennies and a Maceo spending them on bullets; to that
ver of Cubans within and Cubans without against those who are
no longer Cubans.
If every Cuban offers what he can; if we obtain, as was
done in 1895, the fraternal embrace of our brother peoples; if
we put the interests of a country that must be saved before our
personal interests, Cuba will be independent. Because this bat-

MEMORANDUM T.OR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation between AMBIDDY-1
and Martin Ferrer
DATE : 29 May 1964 at 0130
1. After being informed by night Security that
"Mr. Ignacio" had called I returned A-1's call.
2. A-1 mentioned he would need four RB-12's
and two BB-9's for the next operation. A-1 asked if
they could be given to him directly to take to Nicaragua.
I told him this would have to be checked out with Dick.
3. For security reasons A-1 felt it would be best
for AMJAVA-4 alone to meet with Carl. A-4 will be
staying at the same hotel he stayed the last time they
met. Meeting scheduled for 29 May 64. After 1430
Houston time, A-4 will use -alias of Rafael Carels.

tle has been won. The ty'ant who accumulated guns, tanks and
planes is beginning to realize that they only guarantee a gov-
ernment when the people who hold those guns and manage those
tranks and planes are convinced that the government represents
the purest interests of the nation and the highest destinies
of the country. And those guns, those tanks and those planes
are already being turned against the red beast. The little
western David called Cuba has already let fly the stone which
will know down the ugly Golieth of communism.

A CONTROVERSIAL FERCONALITY
It can be said of the Secretary General of the Movement
for Revolutionary Recovery, Manuel Artine, that there is much
to say, but noker that he has lacked spirit to fight for the
liberty of Cuba.
Combative and polemical, Artine today occupies a singu-
lar position in the fight against Castro in which he collects
furious insults and almost fanatical proselytien in equal quan-
tities. His early struggle against Batista's dictatorship and
his activity in Sierra Maestra in Column One commanded by Fidel
Castro, made him an outstanding figure in the Revolution. His
break with Castro and his denmiation of the olive green trea-
ohery to the great romance of the Cuban people made him the
target for all attacks and insults. In the spring of 1960 Ar-
time went into exile. In Merico he wrote a book denouncing
Castro's apostasy. With other eminent democratic leaders he
helped found the Revolutionary Front (later Committee) and ex-
erted intense propaganda and political activity throughout the
continent which oumlminated in the disastrous Bay of Pigs inva-
sion. This was one of the most critical points in Lannuel Ar-
time's civic career. His activity in it -- personally heroic
though it was -- helped throw on him the shadow of new attacks
and suspicions. But it also converted him into a leader of the
first rank which the maturity of a prison term and his conspi-
ratorial and revolutionary activities afterward only enhanced.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation between AMBIDDY-1 and
Martin Ferrer
DATE
: 4 June 1964 at 0930 hours
1. AMBIDDY-1 was advised that he should call the
Panama Hilton upon his arrival in Panama and ask for Mr.
Boyson or Mr. James.
2. Latest report indicates that the ADRLAIDA will
arrive at Monkey Point at 0400 4 June. A-1 has obtained
his re-entry visa. A-1 was again asked to give us the
toss on his Venezuelan conference. A-1 promised to have
them. (S. 1964).
3. A-1 was asked to please make sure that someone
sees Mr. Barnes concerning the petroleum arrangements.
It was mentioned to A-1 that Mr. Barnes has been waiting
for over a week to see someone in A-1's organization.
Mr. Barnes has been kind enough to offer his services
and we feel it is unfair to keep this gentleman waiting.
All plans to send Sixto Mess and Mr. King Thomas. A-1
will notify us of what transpired at the meeting.
4. A-1 intends calling later in the day because he
has some other matters he would like to discuss with U.S.

for. We advised A-1 that we could see no harm in visiting
him.

re:avid an offer to fly planes in the Congo. A-1 did not
know if Ginebra would accept the offer.

report. A-1 stated that our of their houses is located in
Marianita but he had not met any U. S. officers there,

6. We asked A-1 if he had any ideas of where AMBANG-1
is at present. A-1 is of the opinion that AMBANG-1 is
probably hiding in some small island of Puerto Rico.
7. A-1 inquired if he could sue the Newsweek magazine.
We advised him that he could sue but the likelihood of him
winning the case was slight. A-1 was referring to the
article which stated he intended to draw the United States
into an open conflict with Castro. We asked if there were
any truth to the matter. A-1 laughed and said, "Of course
not."
8. A-1 was advised that we consider 7 June a firm
date for the Consejo meeting. The reason we are pinning
him down to a specific date was because of the necessary
preparations that have to be made prior to any meeting.
A-1 said he would be there on that date.

and Martin Ferrer

1. AMBIDDY-1 expects to get his residency permit
today from Immigration in Miami.
3. Concerning A-1's request that we choose frequencies
for the 511 radios it was our opinion this task could be
done by Felix Rodriguez. In the special commo training
given to Felix, a course was a very good reason for
the use of the training of the proper crystals. A-1
mentioned the original request had steared from Felix.
A-1 was informed that the reports we have gotten about
Felix reflect that he likes to give the tedious jobs to
someone else and this is the case here.
3. A-1 and AMJAVA-4 will be leaving for Nicaragua
on 5 June.
4. A-1 asked if the Consejo meeting could be post-
poned until 9 June. A-1 was reminded when we originally
asked him to pick a day for the meeting we considered it
a doinite commitment. A-1 dequiesedand said he would
be there on 7 June.
5. The tentative date for the departure of the
ADELAIDA for the operation is 7 June.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

DATE : 30 May 1964 at 1230
1. AMBIDDY-1 stated that AMJAVA-4 will be meeting
with Carl in Houston this afternoon.
2. A-1 wants to meet with the Consejo on 7 June at
0830 in Panama City.
3. A-1 again reminded we would like to have the tapes
on what transpired in Venezuela. Martin reiterated that
in order to protect his interest we must have current
intelligence concerning his organization.
4. It is the opinion of the Code that a frank,
off-the-record talk with Al Part of the Miami press would
be a very good deal of interest. So be a responsible newspaper
man and he may be in a position to help A-1 put the
Pilon raid in its proper perspective. If A-1 thinks
this is a good idea he should speak openly to Burt about
the Pilon raid omitting the ambroil of the Burt's own
bacco industry. The Burt was reminded this inter-
view, if given, should not mention or allude to KUBARK
support. Since Burt is an ambitious journalist he may
probably ask A-1 2.7 a scop on his next raid; again we see
no harm in this. A-1 said he would ask Burt if he wanted
to go on a future raid. We mentioned that we doubted he
would accept the offer.
8. According to A-1, AMYUN-18 is still in New York
and is expected in Miami shortly.

leave drydock on 31 May.
7. A-1 reported he has talked to Miguel Angel Quevedo
of Bohemia Libre and representatives of Life magazine con-
cerning the release of pictures to be taken by his own combat
photographer. A-1 added, however, he had made no firm
commitment.
A-1 was asked if his next operation had been given
a name yet. He said the next one was to be called "Simon
Bolivar." We told him that we: already learned the code name
and warned him against loose talk and the damages that could
ensue.
9. A-1 was asked to contact Manolin Hernandez and inquire
why the DC-3 cannot be in Panama before 2 June 1964. A-1
was advised that Petrosky can furnish a crew to p'ck up the
plane if necessary but cannot since he has no contact with
anyone in Costa Rica. A-1 stated he would call Hernandes
in Costa Rica.
10. A-1 was informed that three men aboard the ADELAIDA
have signed off and should be returning to Miami on 29 May 64

8. GUERTLER again reminded A-19 that it was no lonzer sufficient
to merely deny ODYOKE involvement in the project but was necessary
to take positive steps to implicate other Latin American governments
and to be given to the U.S. Government. This is not a matter
It was lift to A-19's discretion on how to do this, but when talking
about his problems with AMWORLD-2, Sopo and Mále it was suggested
that he do this in strictest confidence as just for the inner
circle of AMYUM. This will guarantee the story proper dissemination.

AMENDED MEETING 15 WASHING, D.C. 19 May 1964
SUBJECT: AMENDOY's Reaction to Advice to
Delay Return to U.S.
1. ANJAVA/4 reported that ANTUN-19 conveyed to
ANSIDOT-1 my advice that he not return to PAFRIG right
sucy, but permit the dust to settle. According to
ANJAVA/4 is advice led AMIDDY-1 to conclude that
OCACLD did not vient his back in PAFRIG. In order to
test this theory, AMENDOT-1 decided to make a beeline
for the U.S. Embassy in Menages to pick up his imi-
gration visn.
2. (Headquarters has learned that the visa was
prapently granted and we presume AMBIDDY-1's concern
that he had been exiled a second time has as a result
been assaged.) I asked ANJAVA/4 to tell ANDIDY-1
to be the proposed to velcomo him as a potential
fellow-sitizen. Also, relationship was based upon
complete mutual trust. Our information has been
rear in PAFRING. What we were concerned about this that
AMENDY-1, should be return at this time, would be
doubtedly be talked to by CACLID, OENDY and the press.
All this it would be best to sidestep.
3. ANJAVA/4 was asked to convey to AMBIDD-1
that we vill tell him when the coast is clear. If this
mostwithstanding he should return to PAFRIG, the desisim
vould, of course, be his. "It is his right to come back
at any time, but 1 think my advice is good."

26 May 1964
AMOOLD MESTING IN WASHSTON, D.C. 19 May 1964
SUBJECT: AMALDENT'S FERSOMEL POLICY
1. AMJAVA/4 offered the following analysis of
AMALDENT-1's personnel policy as a significant fest
of his relationship with others.
2. AMALDENT-1 is a leader and a very proud leader
who does not like to fail in the presence of his associates.
3. AMJAVA/4 was glad that the Miami incident (13 May
press conference) happened. "AMIDDT-1 was really angry
with himself."
4. From the start AMJAVA/4 has tried to convince
AMALDENT-1 that Jose HOLE NOALS is not qualified for
intelligiease - so far in vain. 'To let MOLE fail in
design the job is the way to convince AMILDT-1"
5. AMTUN-19 cannot handle MOLE or Edgar 2000,
because AMIIDOT-1 won't lat him. "We shall have to wait
until they fall down on the job."
6. AMJAVA/4 claim to have a lecer relationship
with AMIIDOT-1 than does AMTUN-19. He thinks he under-
stands AMILDT-1 better than does AMTUN-19, that he
(AMJAVA/4) means how to get things from AMILDT-1.
ATMUN-19 makes the mistake of using the direct approach
where it would be better to go about it in a remandabout
way. "There are seems things which you BECIGHT tall
SOMEIER, them GUERTEA tells AMTUN-19 who talle
AMIIDOT-1, which it would be better to tell AMILDT-1
direct." AMJAVA/4 related that AMILDT-1 took uttrage
at AMTUN-19 for conveying to his NICKER. The
the MENT press conference. The RINCE when
TREFILM passed intelligence about the alleged
of 50 cal. machine game positioned near F100, because
he considered this an implied attack of the soundness
of the Fillea plan which AMIIDOT-1 himself had dicem up.
7. Endquarters tape pointed out that during the
SECONI


-2-
critical periox following the Miami press commerce,
ANTUM-19 was the only available, cleared chasmal to
AMOROLD and time, in view of OMAID'S mafaverable reaction,
was of the essence. AMJAVA/4 was asked to convey this
explanation to AMBIDOT-1 and to stress that 118 consider
ANTUM-19 his semior rep in FAPRIKE.
8. AMJAVA/4 stated that there had been many betrayals
and consequently AMBIDOT-1 was always careful. At time
be might even think that AMTUM-19 was not loyal which,
ANJAVA/4 added, 'of course is not true." As AMBIDOT-1
malyses his own performance, he is satisfied that he is
performing well. Be has been in the resistance business
since Batista's days and many intimate friends have be-
trayed him. At the present moment, he does not have 100%
confidence in anyone. Everything he is told, he analyses.
As an example, AMJAVA/4 briefs Chaves (the Muriens) on a
projected operation. AMBIDOT-1 will question AMJAVA/4
closely in order to make sure that the instructions did
not deviate from the plen as conceived by him.
9. Among matters which should be taken up with
AMBIDOT-1 direct, no matter how ticklish, was e.g. the
case of.MOLE. ANJAVA/4 and AMTUM-19 have that KUBAKE
have a poor opinion of him. Then why beat around the
bans! AMJAVA/4 at least had not witnessed a
of this by RECHROFT in AMBIDOT-1's presence. Instead
ANTUM-19 had reported GUERILEA's statement that he can
Eidered MOLE a poor choice for the intelligence job to
AMBIDOT-1 and the latter had jumped to the conclusion that
It was ANTUM-19 putting words into QUERILEA's mouth.
10. RECHROFT cumented as follows: ANTR-19 will have
to tell GUERLEA or myself if in a given instance a personal
demarche is indicated. There are certain things which
with AMBIDOT-1 set of the country, simply a commercial
on the shell. We have no choice but the same
to tell ANTUM-19 who, however, should feel free to counsel
unset to use him as a chasmell. Neadepartree rep cended
that AMBIDOT-1 could slightly resest anything which smacks
of a jumier office? (i.e. QUALIFIE) giving orders to him
vis ANTUM-19, an impression we would do over best to
�
crediente.

11. BECKHOTT stressed that we were anxious not to
give ABBIDDY-1 the impression that there exists any
special relationship between us and ANUM-19, AHAAVA/4.
Our relationship was with ANBIDDY-1 who is the leader
of the movement. AHAAVA/4 replied that he had told AMBIDUT-1
this and that BECKHOTT had made this point very clear at
their first meeting in 1967. He wrote Rico (the 1967-1) and
the 1968-1969-1969. He said, "The briefing of AHAAVA/4.)
BECKHOTT added that he had cold ANUM-19 and wished to
repeat this in the presence of ANIAVA/4 that anything
discussed while AMBIDUT-1 was not present, could be told
his. Nothing was "off-the-record" in the sense of to
be withheld from AMBIDUT-1.
12. According to ANAVA/4, AMBIDDY-1 knows full
well that BHAAVA considera him the Chief. If we decided
to encompass against AMBIDDY-1 in League with ANIAVA/4
and ANUM-19, this could only be done within ANUM, the
political movement, since ANIAVA/4 and ANUM-19 forms pares
of that organization. Our support, however, is to
AMBIDDY-1 and most ANUM. AMBIDDY-1 knows that.

1. Ted Sable called the undersigned at home
shortly before 2100 on 18 May 1984 from Miami, Florida.
2. Daga the conversations by telling Sable that I had
discussed the matter of a contact in the Miami area
and that it was our opinion that we could best collabe-
rate with him from Vashington inmameh as it was caly
here that the full atery is known. Sable accepted
this with the comment that he would naturally be
with our judgment in the matter. The absence of our
general conversation is to be the

Toward the case of our conversation Pwale
interjected the statement, "Oh, I guess I had
better than the same way. You will read it in the
paper in the morning, that I have just come from
a meeting with RAY." Sable gave the impression
of being very satisfied with his first time.
Vissed that RAY was the first year his venture.
I have been a question that I had raised on 10
May, Sable informed us that he vas convinced that
there was no serious discussion within the reake
of the JUNE. It is my question that the true

suticularly inherent in Cahan organizations. I

then in all likelihood RAY could not be in Cabe

that he anow of vuch group I was speaking and
he undoubtedly vould as Rogelio CISNKEOS probably

I had not and that in all likelihood if such a
thing had happened, I should know about it.

Eale then told me that he had heard vis

ANTOBLED Neeting in Washington, 19 May 1964
SUBJECT: AMBIDOT-1's Relations with Adelaide Padrora y Grua
1. ANJAYA-4 remarked that AMBIDOT-1 had not mentioned
to anyone that BECHOOF had miked with him about this affair.
(See AMOYOLD Neeting Memo 13-16 Feb 1964, Subject: Adelaide
Padrea y Cruz.)
2. BECHROFT re-affirmed that the matter had been raised
in compliance with his wishes that we let him know about any
derogatory information on subject. He had been told "in slow
English" that we in fact had information from several sources
which testify to Subject's former intimate relations with
Tulgemioz Rastita. BECHEURY had drawn AMBIDOT-1's attention
to the following alternatives:
a. Jumors are true. AMBIDOT-1's decision is
obvious.
b. Jumors cannot be confirmed. How serious is the
damage they cause to AMBIDOT-1s public position.
2. AMBIDOT-1 had listened carefully, merely commenting
that all this was "very interesting." He had not been pressed
to make a decision. Specifically, BECHROFT had told him that
subject was reparted to have been the mistress ci other pro-
minent Cuhans, besides Rastita, and that AMBIDOT-1 could
especially be blishmailed by JURF and the press, to mention
ealy a few sources of threat preseund knowledgeable.
C. AMBIDOT-1 had not been told that his affair with
Subject was liable to the right of the WORLD. After all, he
was an intelligent man who did not have been exposed to
obvious, via. that a press scandal would be serious indeed.
DAMOLD, when had consulted, had taken the position
that AMBIDOT-1 should reach the necessary conclusions himself.
Our position was that AMBIDOT-1 could not run a political
submment unless he could handle his personal affairs. The
Hakemail potential in thasffair was serious as far as
DAMOLD.
3. AMJAYA-4 believes that the problem in relations
be treven AMBIDOT-1 and ANTUR-19 stems from the fact that the
latter has discussed Subject with AMBIDOT-1. ANTUR-19's and

ARJAYA-4'm plans call for a threat to quit ANYORLIS if ANJAYA-1
makes knowm his decision to marry subject. In the same breath,
ARJAYA-4 stated that he had not made his views knowa to ANJAYA-1
because then our position would be the way it is now with
ANYOL-19. You cannot put ANJAYA-1 to the vall. He must be
led to believe that it was he who made up his mind.-
6. In forecasting his and ANYOL-19's strategy, ANJAYA-4
stated the follewing:
"ANTUM is not just ANJAYD-1. It is all of us. He
is working for ANYOL and in that regard is asseverable to
all of us, because he is part of ANYOL. When we talk
about the Adelaide problem, we talk about a preblein
arising within the organization. ANJAYA-1 has what
that is the most important factor for him not
for ANYOL. But in ANYOL we have to decide. Even the
people in jail inside Cuba want to know if it is true that
ANJAYD-1 has a mistress and believe that we are condoeing
this. ANJAYD-1 is not only answerable to the
unfair, but we do. In turn, we have for our
arriceded caradicate. We want out of ANYOL I have to decide
if I will fight or not. ANJAYD-1 is clear on that."
7. In stating our position, we made clear to ANJAYA-4
that marriage is not a deciding factor in determining our
severe of action. An ensuing scandal might serve our hand.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation Between AMBIDDY-1
and Carl E. Jenkins
DATE
: 1800 hours, 12 May 1964
1. AMBIDDY-1 called to report that he had just
arrived in Miami and was on his way to a meeting with
Al Bodriguez at the Holiday Inn.
2. I told him that some of our friends had
notified some activity that indicated mother and baby
might be up to something tonight. AMBIDDY-1 said he
didn't know anything about it but would check and let
us know. I asked him to try to confirm it so we could
help him if he wished us to.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation between AMBIDDY-1 and Martin
Ferrer
DATE : 11 May 1964 at 0930
1. AMBIDDY-1 telephoned from the Miami airport to say
that he would be leaving in two hours for the Dominican
Republic to meet with President Reid on the morning of
12 May 1964.
3. A-1 expects to meet with PETER C. ENITTEL and Tom
Murphy at the Miami Airport this morning before A-1 departs
for Dominican Republic.
3. A-1 was advised that Mr. Alfred ROBENYER would
like to meet with him at the Holiday Inn at Coral Gables upon
A-1's return tomorrow. A-1 stated he would be at the Holiday
Inn after 1800 on 12 May 1964. A-1 was assured that his meeting
had nothing to do with our operations and not to worry.
4. A-1 has given the commo plans to A-19 who will give
them to Mike GUERTELER (P) sometime this afternoon.
5. Due to AMJIVA-A-4's late arrival in Nicaragua the entire
schedule for the operation has been pushed back one day
since the ship left one day late. A-1 also mentioned there
have been some minor changes in the land operation.
6. Manolin Hernandez is now in Panama dealing with Mike
Petrosky concerning the DC-3. A-4 apparently had a narrow escape
on a Nicaraguan plane and A-1 appears determined to have his
own plane in the air.

7. According to Nagdenberg, the Dutch engineer, the
ship is in fairly good condition and should require no more
than five days in drydock. A-1 casually mentioned that
the Dutchman had to be dissuaded from going on the operation
itself.
8. A-1 was reminded we must have a firm statement from
his as to when the operation is to take place if we are to
be of assistance to his organization during the critical
period. A-1 stated he had promised to break the heads of
the commo people aboard the ship if they fail to advise him
as to when the Swift departs from the mothership.
9. A-1 would probably leave for Nicaragua on Wednesday
to be at the base in time for the operation.

4. A-1 commented if it would be possible for Kelly
to arrange fueling facilities at Bluff with Texaco 011
rather than Esso. The person in charge of the Esso company
in Bluff apparently is not in the same time. It is comment;
there is no matter whether to deal with Esso. A-1
inquired if the person in charge of Esso could be replaced.
A-1 was informed that although Kelly enjoys a great deal
of influence with Esso we doubt that he has that much
influence. As it stands now the LCM obtains supplied there
and it is then transferred to the ADELAIDA because A-1 is
reluctant to take the ADELAIDA near the Esso installation.
8. In conclusion A-1 was complimented on the manner
his organization behaved during the operation.
6. Should A-1 obtain any definite information as to
when he will be going to the Dominican Republic he should
call our office in order that we may make our own traveling
arrangements.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation between AMBIDDY-1
and Martin Forrer
DATE : 29 April 1964 at 0800
1. The undersigned telephoned AMBIDDY-1 at his home in
an attempt to reach him before his return to Miami became
too well-known and he became engrossed in other matters.
2. A-1 was advised that one of the most urgent matters
now pending was his trip to the Dominican Republic to meet
President Reid to resolve the problem of drydock facilities
for the ADENALDA.
3. It was obvious from the sound of A-1's voice that
he was still half asleep and further conversation at this
time would be useless. A-1 was requested to call Martin
at the office later in the day.

AMFORLID Meeting in San Juan, P. a., 2-5 May 1964
SUBJECT: Beality of antomay
1. On 4 May 1964 MD3 representatives raised with ANTUN-19
the question if AMBIDOT-1 in his own mind accepte the premise
of independence from KUBARK control in his management of AMFORLD
affairs. ANTUN-19 republiated ANBIDOT-1 had not always done
to be a possible conclusion convinced that he was in de facto control
of AMFORLD. Commenting upon that fact, AMBIDOT-1 had recently
remarked that he now thought he could, if he so decided, fire
fie/both AMUVA-4 and ANTUN-19 without KUBARK attempting to
gatimay his.
3. The arrival of James ZADOT on the scene had at first
re-hielded AMBIDOT-1's suspicion that KUBARK may after all try
to elamp tight the problem. He has his operation. However, ZABOT's
re-appears, which had diamed those suspicions and convinced
AMBIDOT-1 that he is in fact master of his destiny. ANTUN-19
remained that AMBIDOT-1 had in the beginning suspect.
and AMUVA-4 as being KUBARK plan to be wanted
to be quite candid in telling that he would not himself have
accepted a position in AMBIDOT-1 had he entertained the slightest
debits as to the fact.
4. Comment: To found no reason for dibelleving ANTUN-19's
acceptance of antomay as the principle guiding our "ole in
ANFORLD. As an aside, ANYUN-19 observed that AMBIDOT-1 should
not be expected to subordinate himself to PICTURE control
any kind aese FEMUENT: had been liberated and we all used that
this was likely to be the case.

ANHORID Meeting in San Juan, P.R., 2-5 May 1964
SUBJECT: Cackling Over Unlaid Kgs
1. ANTUN 19 centided 1.) us that ANHIDOT-1 had, prior to
the lusning of Operation ZEROM, prepared a "three and one
sucge" new release which laid exaggerated claim to
samples initiated during the raid on Santa Cruz del Sur.
Only the last sentencee atated. more or less as an afterthought,
that this should be considered just a minor MRA operation.
ANTUN-19 has told ANIDOT-1 that in his opinion any future
anecuocesents should be held down to one or two brief para-
graphs.
We pointed out to ANTUN-19 that AMIDOT-1 was
divided by playing no more than lip service to our recommen-
tific that he under-rather than over-play his successes.
Buring the Washington meeting (19-21 March 1964) we had
criticized a statement made by AMIDOT-1 during a new
experience to wit: "We do not have a new time for the
night time. We do not pay but not more. but we are doing
to be will fill the country with enough arms to free the
country from communism." We took the position that if we were
in AMIDOT-1's shoes we simply wouldn't let on about military
mattes aince this plays into Castro's own. We had a
great deal of the money until the annual. AMIDOT-1
granted by asking us how could realize the morale of the
people without saying anything and without talking about
unceceal ofs amside.
2. We mentioned to AMIDOT-1 that any vital informa-
tion not publicised makes the task of Castro's esplegance
service that more difficult. Besides, this is the
to a pass where little croducts are in claims of
success and pressure by Cuban exile leaders. What

inplate the significance of his initial successes and to present
them in their proper perpeetive. ne sould refer to those
mocemes as mere appetizers, with the main dish to follew
later. This approach rather than the claim of a big victory
would aivase the kind of interest, and the "sufficient" the
kind of premonition which carries psychological impact.
4. We doubt whether AMBIDITY at this stage is prepared
to heed our counsel to be conservative in his claima to victery.
In the unhealthy climate of the application, engendered by the
appeteele of any of the simile organisations vying to be the first,
AMBIDY-1 may be unable to resist the temptation to breadmeat
his victories and to exaggerate the damage they have inflicted.
So will have to learn the hard way.

ANNEOLD Meeting is San Jana, P. E., 2-5 May 1984
SUBJECT: The Nature of the Americas Commitment
1. Alleding to certain charges levelled against CIA in
c. recent publication ve the Bay of Piga affair, whose sub-
stance was that the Cuban military leadership had been served
with erroneous intel estimates by their CIA advisors, I voiced
to ANNUAL-19 the hope that the U. S. team servicing the
would never be subjected to the fact that the U.S. was explaining
the U.S. was the most serious case in the instance of the Bay of
Paga). I reiterated that it vas our strong desire to be
absolutely forthright with our Cuban counterparts, especially in
stressing that our target intelligence had been a serious threat to
the U.S. and the U.S. was the most important; it came to predicting
the extent and nature of Cuban defense seasures. As an example,
certain radar sites had struck us as highly vulnerable to ex-
ternal raids; but that this estimate might not necessarily be
bees set if put to the test of an actual operation.
1. In the general content of pasts fulfilled, I come
were pisted out to ANNUAL-19 that the American commitment to
the was a tomsus one and that I would never be able to
be the same as the U.S. and the U.S. was the most important
other than what can be deduced from the events of the
According day. As an example, official Americans reactions to
widening represuasions of a limited ANHORL success in
the leading Chas was simply unpredictable. ANNUAL-19 has
been the most important, but it is not possible to estimate of the
divestances I had outlined and that this sense of urgency in
smoking operations was partly a reflection of a sense of
insccurity engendered by the official American posture in
recent to Chas.

1. A-19 was asked to provide the Case office with a sample
of recent ANTUM radio program. (Comment: PV registered this.
A Station contact is considering producing a "Positive" type
program, originating in Miami, and broadcast over WRU. A 11
exile groups would be represented and it would provide a means
for special broadcasts such as announcements of any subsequent
ANFORLD opa, etc.
3. Reports from Neain Elias frequently mention an action group
known as "H.L.B". one of whose leaders uses the war name "el
the 10 March included an appeal
for bollp in exfiltrating "el Diblin" in the way the are in
danger. A-19 has heard that eix man of the M.110, have
come out. One of the men is said to be "el Diablo" (Comment:
Confizined by BARE 1883) After they have been processed and
disclosed A-19 will have them debriefed by ANFAT-84 and
Alcained the 10 March. The 10 March period of most
of the documents furnished by Nacis and are either
worthable contacts of Nacin or are completely controlled by
the 09C. The latter theory is probably the correct one.
3. A-19 thinks that the captain of the Adelaide will eventually
be replaced by Nause if he does not quit "ret. As is still pet
experiencing the kind of leadership necessary for military opa.
This, of course, will necessitate finding a new captain for the
Bolletso. Of the three cormen the recently left the Adelaide,
the having difficulties with the rest of the over and one,
see Cames, left after his brother had beca. fired by ANHIDT-1.
1. Cencier asked A-19 if ANHOLD-1 had received a security
briefing recently remaining hin not to discuss ANORLID business.
A-19 wanted to knew if A-2 was still talking too much. The
underigned replied that quite a bit of information pertaining
to ANORLID was coming acorces his desk and that it appeared to
be a very serious ANORLID. When efficient details are available it
vill be made to the attention of the Censeje or. AMHIDT-1,
but in the same way an A-19 can remind A-1 to keep quiet about
ANORLID business.

investigation as a result of the protection both the CI and
operational leads aspecte of the matter.
8. Aida PEREZ Poso, Scutler asked what her function was with
AMORILO. A-19 admitted that he was surprised to see her name on
the payroll. She is working with Mole in intelligence. She
has all the lesbian contacte in the city and knows everything
that goes on. Nothing can be done about it because she is another
"woman of confidence" of AMBIDDY-1.
7. The Case Officer brought up the matter of telephone security,
the possibility that A-19's private line and his hope phone
could be tapped, and suggsisted the use of pay phones. The operational
effect of the House will be a major role in the use of direct
dialing A-19 could call the Consejo giving his number and await
the return call. (The Consejo might want to bring this up with
A-1) According to A-19 Mole's group is monitoring all eails to
ANTUH headquarters but he does not think his private line (the
tobacco company) and the other ordered. In reply to the same year's
question A-19 said that A-19 does his business from his homea.
i.e. the house of his mistress. The Case Officer commented that
this fact was known to another group (unspecified) and let the
matter drop.
0. The reason for the blown AMTUM safe house: While the AMTUMS
were on the roof stringing the antenna one of them drove his
car onto the lawn of the neighbor so that it would be in the
same time. The second line was carefully the same in the
to see what was going on. He did not know that 19 said, when he
learned of the incident he had to laugh (albeit somewhat hysterically)
The only alternative would be to kill the idiot. Guertler agreed.
We can only hope that the next safe house will be tory isolated.

has informed AMYUH that if he can be picked up he will be able
to come to the WAVE area for about 15 days for debriefing and
training. The Ramon Mondeir Cie. and the 15 days for debriefing
and training. He has been a member of the Board and waiting for exfiltration
a
currently in the WAVE area, having escaped with four others.
Accordig to A-19 they have been interviewed by BUDREE and were
told to have no contact with any other PRUREN group's because
the 15 days for debriefing and with the 15 days for debriefing and
against ANTHUG. The AMYUH have been debriefing the five for
several days with the same idea in mind. GUETLER will get the
reports when the debriefings are over. A-19 has not gotten the
preliminary reports but says Alonso in invressed with Mondejera.
The 15 days for the WAVE area of WAVE area with has no intention of
attempting it but A-19 is considering offering the opportunity
to do so to Aldo Vera (see below).
2. Aldo VERA Sorefin (201-326634) This subject is a former member
of the DTC, recently considered for use in an attempt to defe:
a GOC-official in Madrid. Ths AMYUS consieur nini a good action
type and sought him out with the intention of infiltrating him
and his group into Habana province. He is presently receiving
special training for the job. However, the 15 days for debriefing
and with his group into the Newuser, local traces do contain
unsubstantiated accusations that he is a G-2 and that he maintains
contacts with alleged 6-2 agents and informera. An ODELY report
in 1963 said that Vera was engaged in transmitting and receiving
messages by radio with Cuba. The other one of the 15 days for
debriefing and with Cuba. The other by way of proof he had
uses doubts about Vera and cited the above. A-19 says that Vera
does have radio contact with friends in Habana (voice) and that
he offered hisrardie facilities to AMYUN. Assuming that Vera himself
is clean. A-19 was cautioned to the 15 days for debriefing and
with Cuba. The other one of the 15 days for debriefing and
any commitments. The undersigned continues to have some reservations
but Vervaws requested by AMSHAG-1, and A-19 likes him so far.
Suterier will pursue the matter further at a later resting.
3. AMILAC-2 has been told by OURGE that as long as AMYUN requests
peraiesion for him to leave the country he will be blackballed.
are reports for reason for blackballing). According to
A-19 DURGE suggested that if he was to be used he could be taken
out as a crewman on the Adelaide. A-19 wanted to know if it was
BUBARK that was keeping his on the list. Guertier pleaded ignorance


and remarked that it could be for any number of reasons completely
unrelated to his past relatione with KUBARX.
4. 16 PRO Is were turned over for traces. The various group leaders
are continuing to recruit for their groups. The Case officer suggested
that they might employ their time more profitably by working with
what they are. The group had to be working to AMYUN-23, A-19
agreed that the system had to be changed in the same time.
in theory some time ago. Gertler suggested that it would be a lot
easier on all concerned to look for people with the qualifications
of the group. Using slote instead of the present procedure of looking
for jobs to explain the same time that present themselves. After
having screened at least a thousand thousand increase we still keep getting
PAQS on potential cooks or people for when specific job exists
but who are considered "very good boys". A-19 agreed. Probably
nothing will change.

writer strongly urged him to keep this group completely compartmented
from any other groups. So far, he said, he said, he said, he said.
The committee of the 1975 press but very little is known about the
coordinator, Benny NIEVARE. Guerler suggested that A-19 should
have these people questioned about w the they know of NIEVARES,
the circumstances surrounding their recruitment. This group was
not a member of the American Society of the American Society
for material help. From what is known of this organization it
seems quite likely to be a provocation, and as A-19 admitte, these
people are either unusually compesent or completely controlled.
A-19 wants to put them to the test by providing them with sab
theMial and asking them to hit a specific target before discussing
the matter of further fina.ial, or, material, aid.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with AMBIDDY-1, 9 April 1964,
1315 hours
1. The following was relayed to AMBIDDY-1: "We are
glad you have second thoughts about Playa Giron. We have
received more information about military, especially maritime,
in the same time. We have been a male any landing attempt
virtually suicidal." AMBIDDY-1 stated he would confer with
AMJAVA-4 and AMYUN-19 and give us his final decision as to
whether or not this operation would be run. AMBIDDY-1 commented
that one life meant more to have a good sense of the problem. How-
ever, we have been a role of office of the impact an attack
on Playa Giron on the 17th of April would have on the morale
of the Cuban people. The undersigned replied that there are
two sides to the coin; should their operation fail, this would
play into the hands of Castro, and it was the opinion of this
that that the alternate plan would also do much to raise the
morale of the Cuban people.
2. In conclusion it was reaffirmed to A-1 that the
final decision is his. He replied that after his meeting
with AMJAVA-4 and AMYUN-19 he will let us know the final
decision.

Communist and traitor, Artime mentioned that he resigned
because Castro had not been honest with the businessmen by
not telling the their property would be confiscated.
3. The following excerpts from Artime's book Tracion clearly
outline Artime's ideology:
a. "We believe the state should foment and stimulate private
economy, both national and foreign. We have to have an
effective democracy in foreign America.
The "The state" is a basis been prostituted too often.
Many countries call themselves democratic but in reality
are nothing but militarist and demagogic, and many simply
go through the motions of eich. We have to have to
be a major role in which are living off the blood
and toll of the people. The corrupt politicians, the
strong men, the totalitarian has been the strongest
allies of Communism. Our fight is not against one in
it is not a war of personal and social forces against
the nation. We have to be able to allied Castro or what have
you--it is a war against a doctrine; re are as much opposed
to Khrushchev as we are against Tito. We are as much opposed
to the totalitarian left as we are opposed to the fascist right:
b.
"We don't care if they call us extremist. They will con-
tinue to call us rightist or leftist, fascist, philocom-
munist. I recall the words of Don Quixote when he was
passing on the outskirts of a small town and Same, and
to Don Quixote, 'Sir, the dogs are barkiness. Don
Quixote replied, 'Let them, the very heavy are barking
it's because we are going. And we will continue to move.
They say we are very ambitious. Our ambition is that in
the coming days when Cuba is liberated people will pro-
mounce our own people, we expect in our country.'
d. "Our Cuba are not only fighting for the independence
of our country but also for the independence of the American
hemisphere, for the survival of Christian principles in
America, for the Western world." Artime maintains that
the situation today is much the way Lenin would have hoped
for. Britain and France have recogrements.
The "The state" is a very important means--this is exactly
what Lenin would have wanted. Artime has supported his
statements, by quoting Lenin, "Within 30 years we will em-
bark on a peace offensive, of coexistence, and we will
split the free nations and smash the impotent bourgeois."
"The battle-groundi tor Latin America lies 30 miles from
our shores. Should the Western world lose this battle,
the sleeping giant (Latin America) will wake up on the
side of the Communist camp. Then it would be preferable
to be dead because the free world will have come to be."
"We are all guilty for having turned over. So the hands
of men who could not govern her progress. We have knocked
on doors and will contiend the business because our cause is
an important factor for a forced to wait for miracles. We
must prepare for a long fight and not expect the aid of
such organizations as the OAS and the UN. It is up to the
Cubans to liberato Cuba. If we are not going to wage a
var of principles, I will not join that struggle."

by the American engineer. A-1 was advised that the

sent to him in Miami in order to hand carry them to Nicaragua.
A-1 was informed we would have to check into the matter.
8. Upon arriving in Miami, A-1 accidentally met Luis
Somozza. The latter stated he is going to Egypt, Italy and
West Germany. On his return he will stop in Washington to speak
to President Johnson and Attorney General Kennedy concerning
"his plan.''
9. Regarding General Semoza, A-1 mentioned he had no
trouble obtaining the contract for the Dolores from the General.
A-1 will get the document on his next trip to N'caragua.
A-1 was asked if the "unemployment" was insufficient on Costa
Rica. 0. A-1 was not a "little trying to stop nothing of
major importance. Cornelio Orlich had spoken to A-1 during
his last visit and the former had stated that there would be
some grumbling on the part of the Government of Costa Rica
but this was intended only to placate the opposition. Cornelio
Orlich had been the most important source of the April.
Should there be any need to deal with the Costa Rican Government,
A-1 will deal directly with President Orlich. A-1 expects to
see the president on his next tour through Central America.
(There was no indication during this portion of the conversa-
tion of the American American American Association of the
was asked if he still stood by his original guess on Cornelio's
age, that is, 73. Martin informed A-1 that reports we had
received indicated him to be in his 50's. A-1 stated if he is
50 he looks like 73. A-1 asked if we wanted toknow his exact
question. A-1 was told not to go to any trouble to obtain it; we
would just like to know for our own information.
11. Reports received by A-1 indicate Adelaide should
presently be at Disneyland.

SUBJECT: Appearance of Manuel ARTDE Bussa at the A.R.E.C. Session
on 18 Mar 64 in the Everglades Hotel, Miami.
At exactly 1550 hours, 18 Mar 64, Manuel ARTDE Bussa appeared
before A.R.E.C. members. ARTDE spoke for one hour and twenty
minutes, finishing his speech at 1710 hours. During that time he
answered questions from the audience.
ARTIME dedicated the first hour of his speech to "presenting his
credentials" (that is how he called what he was going to say). During
that hour he gave a recount of his actions, beginning with the letter
of resignation which he sent to Fidel CASTRO in Cuba, and then reading
excurpts from things published in exile by the M.R.R. and from his
"Political Testament" which he claimed to have written in the Guatemala
training base in the 24 hours preceding the departure for the Bay of
Pigs invasion, etc., etc., up to the present time. He finished that
part of his speech by de idering that he respected the Constitution of
1940, that he was fighting against a system not against one man, and
that he would continue to fight after the fall of Fidel CASTRO Rus is
another dictatorship were established in Cuba -either a rightst or a
leftst dictatorship- or if it was simply an at-empt to exchange Fidel
for nethod person, no matter who it might be.
Then he said that many porsons said he was an extreme rightist and
others said he was an extreme leftist, that oth. said he was an
ambitious individual, and others said he was 37 orportunist. That all
he could ansver to those who said he was an extrusist was that he did
not like extremes, either of the right or left, because these extremes
always ended by touching each other. That to thom who said he was an
ambitious individual he replied that yes, he was ambitious, but that his
ambition was for his name to be spolgen with respect some day in his country
that he had the ambition that at least, after his death, it would be said
He was a vorthy man. That, in short, what he had was a great ambition
for Ristory. That to those who said he was an opportunist he could saye
"Zs opportunism is making use of every moment and every opportunity to
de something for the country. x am an opportunist. If opportunism is

changing ideas in accordance with this or thnt situation, then I am
not an opportunist because I do not change my ideas. I have upheld
the same ideas since I appeared in the public light, and they are here
in my Political Testament and in other declarations and documents which
: have made and written. For those reasons I cannot be an opportunist.
He also said that he had knocked; was knocking and would continue to
knock on all doors to get assistance for the liberation of Cuba. That
he classified men into two categories only, worthy men and unworthy men,
and there were no other differences. That to him are men were equal,
be they black or white, rich or poor, members of one regime or of another.
That he has known and knows many worthy men from all regimes, etc., etc.,
etc.
Questions and Answers
Following are some of the most outstanding questions and answers
Questions: A man who said he was named Filiberto REVENO and that
he worked for a TV station at Los Angeles, California, asked the
following question. "Mr. ANTHE, I am going to ask you a strong question
which therefore requires a previous explanation. Some time ago one of
your representatives in Los Angeles told me you would be going to that
city and I was going to ask you this question; but you did not go. Now
that I have the opportunity I am going to ask this question to you.
The question is this: In Los Angeles and other places there are rumors
that in certain U.S. circles, which are described as extreme lioerale,
they have the plan of using some chans--like you, fo: cormple--to keep
the rest of the Cubans entertained making thea think they will go to war
when the fact is that their plan is very different. The plan consists
of not having that war and thus be able to show, ir a few years, how
peseful coexistence is possible. My question is this: Have you ever
considered that you might be the Cuban who has been chosen for this
and that you might still not be avare of it?
Answers : don't know whether such a plan exists or not, what I
can, guarantee to you is that I would not be the Chian chosen for that.
I an precisely supported by the group which is opposed to those liberales.
by the group of Latin American men who fear just that, not by the U.S.

but by the countries of those Latin Americans. I am a Latin American
product, not anotier kind of product. I am receiving help from Latin
America and that is why x cannot be chosen for that plan. Maybe others
are being selected for that. (ovation.)
Questions A lady in the audience, not a member of A.R.E.C., who
said she was a teacher from Las Villas province, Cuba, asked the next
question. She began by saying in brief vords the help which she had
given to insurgents in Zar. Villas province, etc., etc., and that she had
had to leave Cuba because three of her boys had been executed. Then
she asked ARTIME: "Why isn't help given to those insurgents?"
Answers ARTLES said that he did not understand Americans. Then he
said that last week, precisely last week, help had been sent to those
insurgents. That unfortunately it was not all that it should be, but it
was something. Be explained that it is necessary to use small and fast
boats and for that reason heavy cargoes cannot be taken, and that it is
only possible to make two trips in one night to the Cuban coast and for
that reason the help cannot be more effective. That at any rate, they
were inizlitrating arms, shoes, boote, food and technicians in the n:ndling
of arnament. He clarified that the function of the technicians was to
teach the handling of weapons to the peasants and also to unite them.
ARTIME then told the same lady that the person for whom ase was asking
was precisely where he could help those over there, and for that reason
was not in that room. (Be was referring to a person for whom the lady had
inquired when he accompanied her from the seat to the microphone, as the
lucky spoke vary softly and the audience asked her to go to the microphone
to ask her question so all could hear her.)
questions Another member of the audience asked the following
questions "Mr. ARTIME, we understand-through announcements that have
been published=that Mr. BAY or JURE will go to chua in the coming months,
and there are rumors about another organization doing the same thing.
Are you thinking in some action of that type to counteract the effects
of those possible nations. in favor of your movement?

Answers ARTIME gave the following ansvers: "If they go to Cuba,
may God be with them. But I hope it won't be a demagogic action in
which mon will die to give prestige to others. Let me tell you that
we don't make public what we do or plan to do. Soce people want
publicity for their actions, but we put the liberation of Cuba before
publicity."
Comments In the reporting agent's opinion, nothing new was said
in this public appearance. The "presentation of credentials was already
too well knowa to the audience. The only thing which called attention
was his clear position of opposing any maneuver to try to impose a
"sidelismo without Fidel" which the majority of the audience interpreted
as meaning Nanaual RAY Rivero. Even though ARTRDS did not name RAY,
his implications were quite clear the same as the look on his face when
he was asked something in connection with JURE.

1. Marcos RODRIGUEZ Nenédez, M.D.C. Executives

2. José Antonio VALLE (mat. unk.). Miami News distribution manager,
attorney, mine owner in Oriente provinces:

to buy will be taken from the March-budget.
3. A-1 has received a report from AMJAVA-4 indicating
that there is a need for a general house cleaning as far as

training installations, one of which was reported to be the
property of AMBANG/1. AMBANG/1 replied that he had training
installations on the Florida mainland and had training and
logistical bases or a base in Venezuela.
3. Source asked AMBANG/1 what backing he had from Ford
Powers for the invasion of PBRUEN. AMBANG/1 replied that he
still had significant White House contacts despite the death
of John F. Kennedy. He added that he was in contact with top
of the U.K. and he had a number of image with a very high
ranking officer of KUBARK. He stated he has been asked to be asked
by the KUBARKER to the Chief of Operations at YOACEE and was in
regular communication with the ODOATE officer. In general,
AMBANG/1 stated, his sources of funds were largely ODOKE.
Source then the U.K. and the U.K. was also used to be said the
approval of ODOKE for operations into PBRUEN. AMBANG/1
reported by replied "I have been given the green light".
Around 1 February Source met in San Juan with AMBEND/1
for a private talk. AMBEND/1 suggested that Source associate
himself with AMBEND/1's movement in order to help form a post-
liberation government. Source replied that he was rather vague
as to AMBEND/1's plans and backing. AMBEND/1 stated that he
said he was a member of the American Association for the
leadership and experience for the overthrow of ANTBUG. Source
asked if he understood correctly that AMBEND/1 was telling his
that he had the approval of ODOKE. If so, why was AMBEND/1
draving support from Venezuela and from Central America
and the American Association for the American Association
actually rely on Venesuela and other Latin America donors for
his assistance, since he was receiving all his logistical and
financial support from KUBARK. Source stated that he had heard
the American Association for the American Association for
Hierazga, Costa Rica and Panama Cz. AMBEND/1 replied that
he had been given very large sums of money, which proved the
reliance which ODOKE had in him and made obvious the fact that
ODOKE had selected him to bring about the liberation of PBRUEN.
The American Association for the American Association for
AMBEND/1 before all others as the means of liberating PBRUEN,
AMBEND/1 reportedly replied that ODOKE had selected him because
in the opinion of ODOKE, he represented the most same and
contrast political concentration among the PBRUENS exiles and
ODOKE have that in AMBEND/1 it had a leader resolved to maintain
order and contrast desocratie government in PBRUENF following the
laboration.
AMBEND/1 as used both AMBEND/1 and AMBAND/1 during his
separate interviews with them whether AMBEND/1's presence is
Puerto Rico. signified that the two leaders had met or planned to
meet.in an attempt to coordinate their activities. Neither
AMBEND/1 per AMBANG/1 denied nor confirmed Source's questions,
has gave avasive answers. Source therefore assumes that they had
not met, but hoped to meet for talks.

SYNOPSIS OF AMBIDDY-1'S SPEECH TO AREC
18 March 1964
"You will forgive me if before a gathering the Agrupacion de
la Reconstruccion Economical (w) Cuba I do make profound economic
or technical analysis of the reconstruction of Cuba, the reason
is very simple, it is because I don't know. Inasmuch as I do not
like to talk about things which I know nothing of I prefer not to
touch upon the subject. Here at this gathering there are men more
capable than I
men who will have the difficult task of the
reconstruction of Cuba upon their shoulders.
I want to talk about what I know about. But first let me
present my credentials. Why the presentation of credentials? When
two people speak for the first time the first portion is the
presentation and this is the first time I talk with AREC, although
I have the pleasure of speaking to some of its members separately
had in great lengths. Why this presentation of credentials?
Because I know our movement is very controversial. They say we are
of the extreme right, they say we are of the extreme left, they may
we are opportunist and they say we are ambitious. I do not expect
to change anyone's mind by this talk. I believe it is my duty to
assert certain principles and to mention our beliefs. Not a
criteria of profound economic principles : I am not an
economist nor an expert on the subject. I believe it useful for
our movement to aogert before this assembly some of its principles

in which it professes and will continue to profess and for which
we are prepared to give our lives and in some cases already have.
I believe it is our duty to mention them here or anywhere else.
First of all I do not believe in extremes
neither left
nor right. I believe extremes always end by touching one another.
Secondly I want to state that if any extreme comes to power in
Cuba, in the case of the extreme right by imposing a dictatorship;
in both cases we shall continue to fight with our weapons in hand.
Thirdly, I do not believe in the classification of men by
race, political levels in the government to which they formerly
belonged nor by money
I know whites who souls are black and I
know blacks who souls are white. I know wealthy men who are
spiritually poor and poor who are spiritually wealthy. I only
believe in one classification of men and that is the moral
classification--men of honor and men without honor. Men who keep
their word and those who do not keep their word.
In this
classification I do believe
Are we'opportunist? This depends what your definition of
opportunist is. If by opportunist you mean taking maximum advantage
of each opportunity, then ladies and gentlemen, we are opportunist.
In order to save Cuba we have to take maximum advantage of every
opportunity. But if by opportunista you mean the man who changes
his beliefs in accord with the opportunities, then we are not
opportunist."

AMBIDDY-1 goes on to mention his various publications. He
describes his first publication, "Communism por que?"
(Communism
what for?) which he wrote nine months prior to Castro coming to
power. The main theme of this pamphlet, according to A-1, was
that more than changing a gov:rrment what is needed is a change in
men's conscience. The pamphlet also outlined the duties of the
padron (land owner) to the workers so that the latter may liveo
in dignity and in honor. The patron should feel that the problems
of his workers are also his problems. The worker in xturn has
certain obligations to the patron. If this quid pro quo is not
adhered to the (Christian) government has the right to intervene
for the common good.
Later on, after Castro was in power, A-1 wrote his letter of
resignation accusing Castro of being a communist and traitor.
In this letter A-1 mentions he resigned because Castro had not been
honest with the businessmen by not telling them their property
would be confiscated.
A-1 then went into exile and there he published a book called
Traiccion (Betrayal). This book clearly outlined the ideology of
the movement.
"We believe the state should foyment and similats private
economy both national as well as in foreign. During the Bay of
Pigs I wrote my political thesis. We have to have an effective
democracy in Latin America. / I say effective democracies because
(in Latin America the word democracy has been prostituted too

often. Many countries call themselves democratic but in reality
are nothing but militarist, demagogic, and many simply go through
the motions of elections. Many are totalitarian governments
which are living off the blood and toil of its people. The corrupt
politicians, the strong men, the totalitarian have been the strongest
allies of communism. Our fight is not against one man, it is
not var of personal hatred : it is a war against the doctrine
of hatred be it called Castro or what have you
it is a var
against a doctrine; we are as much opposed to Khrushchev as we are
against Tito. We are as much opposed to the totalitarian left as
we are opposed to the fascist right.
"They continue to call us extremist. We don't care. They
will continue to call us rightist or leftist, fascist, philo-
communist. I recall the words of Don Quixote when he was passing
on the outskirts of a small town and Sancho and to Don Quixote,
Sir, the dogs are barking at us.' Don Quixote replied, "Let them,
Sancho, if they are barking it is because we are moving. And
we will continue to move."
"They say we are very ambitious. Yes, we are very ambitious.
We have an ambition which blinds us and we are disposed to give
our lives for that ambition. An ambition for what? That in the
comix days when Cuba is liberated people will pronounce our
nance with respect in our country."
"When our men die in Cuba they are not only fighting for the
independence of our country
they are fighting for the

independence of the American Hemisphere, for the survival of Chris-
tian principles in America, for the Western world. the rest of
the Western World." A-1 maintains that the situation today is much
the way Lenin would have hoped for. Britain and France have recog-
nized Red China; the U. S. is at odds with these two governments.
This, A-1 maintains, is exactly what Lenin would have wanted. A-1
then quotes Lenin, "Within 30 years we will embark on a peace
offensive, of coexistence and we will split the free nations and
smash the 'impotent bourgeois."
"The battle ground for Latin America lies 90 miles from our
shores in a place called Cuba. Should the Western world lose this
battle the sleeping giant (Latin America) will wake up on the side
of the communist camps. Then it would be preferable to be dead
because the free world will have ceased to be.
"We have knocked on many doors. I have one obsession and that
is the liberation of my country and if I have to lose my prestige
I will do so. God will know I have not lost it. I do not believe
that in order to save my country there are bad doors. The only
bad doors are the ones that have been closed to us in order to
look Cuba within them.
"We are all to blame. We are all guilty for having turned over
Cuba into the hands of men who could not govern her properly. This
is not the time to cry like women for what we were unable to defend
as men. I have knocked on doors and will continue to do so because

my cause is a moral and honorable one and wait I ask for is noble.
We cannot afford to wait for miracles because only God can create
miracles. We must prepare for a long, fight and not expect the aid
of such organizations as the OAS, UN. It is up to the Cubans to
liberate Cuba. We either have to wage a war of principles or not.
If we are not going to wage a war of principles I will not join
that struggle.

"The present situation of the case of Cuba. The present state
of our homeland. Communism is completely established. We lose
daily 10 fighters for freedom. In the cities communism is in complete
control. It is necessary for an individual to carry five different
credentials in order to travel inside of Cuba. Lack of any one of
these credentials brings down the-repressive measures of the G-2
until the individual can explain the reason for his missing
credentials.

Cuba today.
"The status of Cuba outside of Cuba: The U. S. In the most

clear. The Cuban people have always maintained that they are vill-
ing to die."
A-1 then alludes to the Alliance for Progress which he refers
to as an Alka Seltzer in the Pacific. He maintains he is not against
the Alliance for Progress but rather that something should also be
done for Cuba.
Question and answer poliod
Question: I understand that in certain sections of the United
States Government there exist ultra liberals who believe that
communist Cuba could be used as an experimental ground and in the
coming years communist Cuba could be used as a proving ground for
the coexistence of the great world powers, that is, Russia and the
U. S. The question is Dr. Artime, have you considered deep in your
conscience the possibility that the U. S. Government is using: you
and your movement to occupy the Cubans who wish to liberate their
homeland with other activities so that they cannot liberate their
country with the force and enthusiasm they desire. The question is
have you considered the possibility that you, under your best
intentions, are the instrument by which these ultra liberal forces
in the U. S. can paralyze the liberating activity of the Cuban people?
A very good question. If the U. S. were giving no something
this might be true but I believe the ones who are receiving aid,
possibly other ultra librals, may be in collusion with the U. 8.
This is very possible. I can make a mistake. I can make two mintbren
but after one has spent two years in jail one cannot be fooled as

Dasily, more so when one has been condemned to death. It is possible
this plan exists but I do not know since I do not have access to
these ultra liberals. It is possible they are looking for someone
to do it, this is possible. I can guarantee you one thing. I am
not doing this because my power comes from men who believe as I do,
as you do, and who are located south of the Rio Grande. These men
arc gambling the lives of the people in their own countries.
Because they know if they do not help in overthrowing Fidel Castro
in less than two years, their own countries will be victims of
communism. I am a product of the desperation of the Latin American
countries.
Questionn Dr. Aptime, how can we unite the Cubans in order
to make the cause of those fighting inside felt more deeply?
Answer: Very good question. Very good. A North American friend
of mine once said he would rather carry ten cats in a bag than work
with two Cubans. I said to him that he was quite right; however,
Cubans are not the only ones that are hard to understand. The
Latin American is also difficult to understand. Thank God, we are
very individualistic and that is why the communists are having such
a difficult time. Because we are very individualistic. The war
is the only thing which can unite the Cubans. The only thing which
can create an unbreakable bond, betweenurich, poor, Negroes, whites,
Catholics, Protestants, Mason, everyone, is sacrifice. I do not
believe in theoretical unions.

Question: In Miami they say that JURE, Manuel Bay's organiza-
tion, will make an attack on 20 May or early in June. Would there
be any possibility that your movement also intends to do something
in the near future. Also, what is the possibility of having a
governant in arms.
Answer: That is the $64,000 question, If they (JURE) decides
to go, may God bless them. And please let it not be a demagogic
act to give prestige to others. The only thing I ask God in that
He accompany them. I say this with all sincerity. Our strategy
is mapped out. What we have done cannot be published. We cannot
publicize the arms we have sent into Cuba. We cannot publicize the
infiltrations we have made to teach the campesinos about guerrilla
warfare. These are things we cannot'public. Not that we are enemies
of publicity but we cannot subordinate the war to publicity, we are
subordinating the interests of publicity to the var. In a free
election I would admit all political theories but by violence I
will not admit any extremism. The war may last three years against
Fidel and five against communism. It does not matter. We will use
violence to deter any extremism.
Question: About five months ago I arrived here thanks to
people with great influence. Students of mine were in the Escarbray.
I took food and medicines to them, I have 13 girls who helped me
gather rosaries and everything in the ways of clothes. There are now
800 students of mine who are now prisoners. Others are being con-

stantly harassed and persecuted. This area't we helping these
people?
Answer: There are many, madan, who are now helping. This
week we have sent some aid and arms inside, perhaps not as much as
we vould like but sent some. We also have to send not just weapons
but food, shoes etc. The guerrilla lack everything. The problem
of supplying them is very difficult but we are trying. We do not
have sufficient boats. To arrive at the coast we cannot use large
ships but small boats and these small boats have a limited capacity.
These small boats can only make two trips in one day and no more.
It is being done on a small scale but it is being done. The force
to liberate Cuba is there inside Cuba and it is up to.us to assist
them.
Question: Doctor, don't you have any confidence in the OAS.
I refer specifically to the recent cache of arms discovered in
Venezuela?
Answer: I admire the Venezuelan people, I admire Venezuelan
democracy and if a strong measure is taken against Cuba, because of
the just screens of the Venezuelan people and if the OAS listens
to these sercames, I will admire the OAS.

AMIDDY-1 will be meeting with us in the Washington

might be helpful if you could have a heart-to-heart to
with him on his relations with Senora Padren, which pay be
blossoming forth into matrimony. There cannot be much
doubt now that she is reputed to have been Fulgencio
Battista's mistress and that this fact (if fact it be) is
not to be a new series her, the political represents
sleas could be calamitous. It would be helpful if you
could tell AMBIDDY-1 point blank that if sounds

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation Between AMBIDDY-1 and
Raul Hernandez (as Martin Ferrer)
DATE : 13 March 1964, 1800 hours
1. AMBIDDY-1 began the conversation by saying that the
reason he had been late in checking was that he had been at
a meeting with the DMJM engineers. A series of items had been
discussed on which A-1 would like to have our suggestions.
The following items were: (1) the 100% of the items was
possible in order not to give the impression to the DMJM people
that he was being masterminded by someone else. Martin explained
to A-1 that Henry was currently out of town, but that his request
for a meeting would be brought to Henry's attention upon his
Fettura. A-1 went on to say that the deadline for the budget to
be submitted is close at hand which also adds to the urgency
for a meeting.
2. Martin asked A-1 if he had checked his Post Office
box. A-1 replied yes. A-1 was then asked to confirm or deny
the.rumor concerning Santiago Alvarez which alleged that A-1
has given him full autonomy within AMWORLD. A-1 said that he
has not had a chance to talk to Santiago Alvarez since his
return to the next week. He said he was a member of the
further he had approached Santiago Alvarez, the latter was informed
he could bring with him "a mechanic or two," but A-1 never
authorized Santiago Alvarez to bring his entire group en masse.
3. A-1 advised that the radio link between Miami and
Costs Rica has been established. A-1 was told that there would
be no need to obtain a HAM radio license to operate. Should
his organization be approached by the local authorities con-
cerning the operation of the radio, they are to plead ignorance
or the law and stop transmitting. /This information was obtained
from Jim Smith. A-1 mentioned that he had received the dummy

to ANTUNL-19 attending any of the Consejo meetings. A-1 had no
objections.
5. A-1 has some motion pictures and photographs of the
bases and will bring them to the next Consejo meeting.
6. A-1 was informed that a letter from Luis Sierra, chief
of the guerrillas, was intercepted by his own people in Miami.
This letter contained a photograph with Sierra and other members
of the guerrilla teams dressed in their new uniforms. A-1 was
asked to investigate how this letter had been sent from the base
and the same time. A-1 was to have the picture developed.
7. This brought up the city of Manuel Gomez. A-1
said that Gomez will be leaving the American Association
Microagua to survey AMWORLD installations. A-1 had just a
few hours previously spoken to Gomez. In the conversation,
Gomez elaborated on the security measures he wishes A-1 to
take concerning his own security. A-1 continues to sing the
praises of Gomez. A-1 also commented that he has noticed a
marked situation in the American security of his personnel since
the last time he was in Miami.
8. While in Costa Rica, A-1 detected being followed by
another car. A-1 was able to lose the surveiller. Martin
took this opportunity to stress to A-1 the need for increasing
his personal security measures such as more body guards and
more secrecy concerning his movements.
9. The ADELAIDA arrived in Hollywood o/a 8 March. A-1
was not able to examine the contents of the sabotage equipment
due to his preoccupation in Costa Rica with the MCRL and Vico
Starke. The ADELAIDA onloaded weapons from the barge and sailed
for Micaragua.
10. AMJAVA-4, AMWORLD-2 and "the Mexican" will leave
together for Nicaragua on 16 March.
11. A-1 expressed an interest in moving the C-47 out of
Costa Rica. A-1 would like to discuss the method of transfer
with the Consejo.

12. A-1 was told that if it can be done in a secure and
discreet manner through some contact, we would appreciate having
a list of all Cuban nationals in Costa Rica.
13. Concerning the budget, A-1 would like to discuss this
in person rather than through the mail.
14. A-1 said he would keep in close contact with us on a
daily basis.

Starke confronting his with what he had heard. Vice Starke
told Cornelio that what he really wanted was to establish a
contraband business mainly dealing is whisky. Starke also
was to be a very limited timidly told A-1 that he was in financial
straits and the reason why he had wanted to move MCRL people
into key positions was to use the MRR vehicles at a time
mechanism for contraband. He said that he had a that he
could be able to sell of the government to engage in this
value of business. It appears to A-1 that Vice Starke did
present the contraband pro position to Cornelio Orlich and
received tacit approval. A-1 informed the most important
Vico that since it was found to be the could do as they
pleased, however, would not permit his vehicles to be used
for that issue. His main concern was to liberate Cuba and
not to engage in the internal affairs of Costa Rica. His
only desire is to be left alone so he can work effectively.
c. What is Figueres' role in this? A-1 replied that
he had not seen any indications that Figueres had been
involved. Although he and Vico Starke are close friends,
they are political enemies.
: d. What were his specific charges against Cabezas?
A-1 stated:
(1) The main charge against Cabezas was his
collusion with Vico Starke to subordinate AMWORLD to
the MCRL.
(2) Cabezas held a meeting with Vico Starke's
brother and Rafael Calderon without authorization or
informing A-1.
When A-1 initially confronted Rolando Cabezas, the latter
refused to assess any of A-1's questions. At a later
time, the second confessed that the reason why Vico Starke
had wanted control of the MRR was for the contraband
whisky. A-1 feels that this contraband whisky was just
an alibi and the main motive had been to overthrow the
Costs Rican Government.
e. Will Vico Starke accept defect or will he try again
to control our movement? A-1 feels that Vico Starke no
longer poses a direct need of organization. Starke
has been removed as the intermediary to Cornello. Orlich.
Starke, however, is still in close contact with Cornello
Orlich. A-1 emphasized that Vico Starke will not be per-
mitted to enter the camps, mainly GUILLOT, even though it
is on his estate.

A-1 commented that Cabezas had been one of his sources, but
also Col. Fignals plus reports given to A-1 by his own people
in the camps. Bovever, his main source was the facts which
speak for themselves.
3. Changing the subject, Martin asked A-1 why he could not
go to Guatemala. A-1 explained that what he had wanted to say
in his message was that at this particular time Guatemala would
have to be ruled out because his passport showed an exit from
Mercedes Airport in Nicaragua. However, this did not preclude
future meetings in Guatemala. A-1 apologized if he had given us
the wrong bill.
A-1 stated that within the coming week he might want to
have a special meeting with the Consejo concerning the latest
political developments in Costa Rica.
5. A-1 is forwarding us a tape on Honduras and Costa Rica
as soon as possible.
6. A-1 is not satisfied with the developments in Nicaragua
and with Iglesias in particular. A-1 implied that the main
concern may be the funding mechanism in Nicaragua and misuse of
AMWORLD funds. A-1 is sending AMWORLD-2, who is a public
accountant, to review the financial situation there.
7. A-1 was asked to service his post office box since
there are several letters waiting for him.
8. A-1 expects to meet with the DMJM people, who are now
in Miami, along with AMWORLD-2 and AMJAVA-4.

mossages which require immediate attention with the word
"URGENTE" so that members of this office will not needlessly
be called at all hours of the night. A-1 agreed.

to the part referring to "Frank's" discussion of the
conclusions of the book. The book was a short of the ordera
from Washington changing the plan of the invasion. We passed
an Mr. Archer's view that A-1 should stick with the story,
17 it is true, in case reporters should question him about
it, but that we felt that the easiest way to read is a better
and more than one of the most common would be to take it
fairly lightly. In other words, perhaps we could play it as
though it had not been considered serious at the time
because it was felt that Frank was a bit of a bioward any-
way who tried to involve himself. The book was a short of
the ordera from the book. I need he was under considerable
strains and probably this was just a brainstorm. A-4 felt
that this was a sensible way to handle the matter. No
understood it and agreed to discues the matter with AMRIDV-1
and felt that this would be acceptable to him.
2. A-4 askm if we had access to the rest of the book.
I answered that to my knowledge these vere the only two
shapters available at the moment of the book. The perhaps
we had been interested in written, etc., chapter by chapter
and that these vere the first two which had been considered
suitable to go to the printers. We would try to get the
remaining chapters so that they could be studied and considered
as soon as possible, but I simply had so way of knowing that
was their present status and through which chenules they would
be handled. We would let them know as soon as we have anything.
