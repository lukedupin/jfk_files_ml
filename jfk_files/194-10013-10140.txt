4. REPORT OF INFORMS
ROTC ASC at Fort Riley, Kansas. In July 1981, while Source was assigned as an
Individual Tactical Training (ITT) instructor at Fort Riley, Kansas, he re-
ceived performance evaluations from SUBJECT'S peers and cadre personnel de-
scribing SUBJECT as immature and unable to interact with HIS peers. As a result
of these reports, SUBJECT was required to appear before an administrative review
board. The review board was to decide if SUBJECT was to be given credit for
completing ASC. Source, acting as defense representative for SUBJECT, sub-
mitted testimony to the board that SUBJECT should be granted credit for ASC.
Source could not recall any specific statements other than saying SUBJECT was
immature but should be given the benefit of the doubt and be granted credit
for completing ASC. The board ruled that SUBJECT would be given credit for ASC.
Upon completion of ASC, SUBJECT was to report for Annual Training (AT) with
C Battery, 128th Field Artillery Battalion, MNG, Marshall, Missouri. When
SUBJECT returned to KMSC approximately 15 September 1981, HE told Source that
HE had failed to attend HIS AT, (NFI). SUBJECT further stated HE had attended
airborne training at Port Benning, Georgia, from August 1981 to September 1981,
(NFI). In September 1981, SUBJECT'S financial trouble led to HIS disenrollment
from KMSC, which subsequently led to SUBJECT being disenrolled from the RUTC
program, (NFI).
In approximately February 1981, Source was informed by Thomas McCarthy,
Professor, KMSC, that SUBJECT and McCarthy debated the benefits of National
Socialism (Nazism) during McCarthy's American Government class. SUBJECT'S
support for Nazism enraged the other students and further widened the gap with
SUBJECT'S peers, (NFI). Source believed SUBJECT to be loyal to the United
States, but, because of HIS beliefs on Nazism and Communism, HE was branded
"Anti-US" by HIS peers. Source, personally could not recall any occasions in
which SUBJECT specifically denounced the United States Government. In approx-
imately May 1981, Booker T. Washington, SUBJECT'S former Cadet Commanding
Officer, A Company, KMSC, told Source that he was having trouble with SUBJECT.
Washington related that because of SUBJECT'S beliefs in Nazism, and HIS
"superior" attitude over HIS peers, HE was alienating HIS peers against HIM.
Washington related further that SUBJECT had gone AWD overnight in approx-
imately April 1981 to attend a debate between the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux
Klan (KKK) and a representative of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People (NAACP). The debate was held in Columbia, Missouri.
Washington also advised Source that SUBJECT had National Socialist reading mate-
rial in HIS barracks room, (NFI). Source did not know Washington's present
address, only that Washington may be in the Berkley or Oakland, California
area, (NFI).
Source believed SUBJECT was mentally stable, but emotionally immature.

4. REPORT OF IMOMICS
Source believed SUBJECT felt HIS peers were against HIM because of HIS "rightist"
views and therefore, HE would not interact with them. SUBJECT also believed in
the "Mietzsche Philosophy" of superior beings and that HE was one of the
"Chosen Few", (NFI). Source believed SUBJECT to be loyal to the United States
because SUBJECT never made any disloyal statements in his presence. Source
provided no information regarding SUBJECT'S use of alcohol, illegal drugs, or
adverse involvements with law enforcement agencies. SUBJECT was of high moral
character and integrity.
Source was willing to provide a sworn statement and appear before any
court or administrative hearing which may arise concerning SUBJECT.
