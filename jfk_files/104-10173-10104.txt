CITY
1. LICOXY/5 repurred that on 12 October 1965 Subject visited
his place of business and said that he had been referred to LICOZY/5
1000, which is in Embassy. He said he was interested in a one-way ticket
to the Soviet Union. Subject furnished the following information
to LICOZY/5 : He was born on 19 August 1942 in Michigan. He is
a student at U.C.L.A. and was a member of the 503094 issued 29 August 1062.
Subject to the Department of Number C 530394 issued 29 August 1062.
The permanent address was given as 1922Z Pacific Coast Highway,
Nalibu, California. His tourist card showed that he entered Mexico
by bus at Sonelita, Sonora on 9 October 1065. Subject paid for 15
days in the Soviet Union but said that he planned to stay longer.
2. He left Mexico via Air France flight 702 on 16 October
confirmed by flight manifests). His plans call for him to depart
Paris for Moscow via Air France flight 724 on 17 October.
3. During a routine visit to the Consular Section of the Soviet
Embassy, Valentin S. LOGINOV thanked LICOZY/5. He was
of Subjev. Valentin, and his father, a 1964-1965 CALIKHODO and Consular
of the Validamir S. KORMUSKIN, LOGINOV amonished LICOZY/5 for asking
for more biographic-data than he needed to fill out the necessary
papers. LICOZY/5 denied that he had asked for more information than
he needed. (Subject apparently reported LICOZY/5's actions in
obtaining the above biographic data (or was debriefed by LOGINOV,
a suspect KBH officer).
5. 4. It seems unusual for an American student to travel from the
U.S. and the other. or to travel to the Soviet Union since he is
automatically increasing the cost of his travel by a considerable
amount. Since Subject crossed into Mexico on 9 October, only 4
week before his departure for the USSR, it would appear that he
came to Mexico exclusively for this purpose. It thus appears that
the purpose of travelling via Moxico was to conceal this trip from
the U. S. authorities,

11. CURRICULUM VITAE:
A February 1960 Diplomatic List from Argentina lists Subject as
a new Soviet Military Attache due to arrive in Buenos Aires in the near
future. There is no indication that Subject ever filled that post.
From September 1960 to September 1963, Subject and family were
in Havana where Subject served as an Attache at the Soviet Embassy. In
December 1961, he accompanied the Soviet DYNAMO soccer team on a Latin
American tour as their escort and interpreter.
Subject arrived in Mexico City on 3 August 1965 to replace known
KGB officer Oleg Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO (201 305870), as a Third
Secretary.
12. INTELLIGENCE AFFILIATION:
Subject is listed as probable RIS, probably KCB on the basis of
his activities while stationed in Havana and by virtue of his replacing
a known KGB officer in Mexico City. Per NINNA-3570, 3 mo. 66 Subject
conducted Kueven KGB.
13. INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY:
While Subject accompanied the DYNAMO soccer team through La Pas
in December 1961, he became acquainted with KISHIN-1 (identity 1), a
KUBARK Bolivian security service penetration and later a low level
Bolivian university-cell CP penetration. It is not recorded upon whose
initiative the contacts were made. However, by KISHIN-1's admission
he had several informal and friendly meetings with Subject during which
Subject encouraged KISHIN-1 to accept a Cuban student grant. In fact he
specifically expressed an eagerness to be of any assistance in helping
KISHIN-1 to get to. Cuba. KISHIN-1 never went to Cuba, although he did

13. (CONTINUED)
correspond with Subject on the matter on at least one occasion. KISHIN-1
was terminated as an agent in July 1963 for security reasons and because
it was believed that ho was a fabricator. No further 'developments in
his association with Subject were noted.
On the same trip through Latin America in December 1961, Subject
was observed to have in his possession some $2,000 in United States
currency. After sending the soccer team back to Moscow from Quito,
Subject continued alone through Panama City, where he was seen in contact
with a Mexican citizen with whom he flew on to-Mexico City. In Mexico
City Subject reported to known KCB officer Alksoy Ivanovich CAMASHOV
(201 227418) at the Soviet Embassy, From a sensitive source it was
learned that GARMASHOV had been instructed to look into the matter of
Subject's four-day delay in returning to Havana from Quito and that
Subject's superiors in-Havana wore concerned. It is not known what
relationship, if any, these circumstances have to each other.
In Havana early in 1963, Subject befriended and apparently attempted
to cultivate VASLOUCHS 1, 2, and 3. (Idunities 2, 3, and 4). The
association was discoiraged by KUBARK because VASLOUCH-1 and 2 were
performing important functions in' connection with Cuban FI activities and
contact with a possible RIS officer was not thought desireable.
In September 1962 at the invitation of Senior Vazco Leitao de CUNIA,
Brazilian Ambassador to Cuba and newly appointed Ambassador to the Soviet
Union, VASLOUCH-3 traveled to Moscow and accepted a clerical position
at the Brazilian Embassy where she remained for approximately two years. A
year later, in September 1963, Subject returned PCS to Moscow. Between
December 1963 and February 1964, Subject made three attempts to see
VASLOUCH-3. According to VASLOUCH-3, the contacts were by telephone only

and she did not meet with Subject personally while in Moscow.
15. CONTACTS:
In December 1961, in La Paz, Bolivia, Subject was in contact with
KISHIN-1. See paragraph 13 above and Identities.
Subject was in contact in Panama City and on a flight from Panama
City to Mexico City in December 1961 with Elmundo Fausto ZORRILLA
Martinez, a Mexican citizen who had been traveling around Latin America.
The nature of this contact has not been determined.
Subject befriended and apparently attempted to develop in Havana
VASLOUCHS 1, 2, and 3. See paragraph 13 above and Identities:

1115, having put has language in the car with license plates 19-DA.
(This is the car regularly driven by LOCI NOV.) A LICALIA pioote-
graph of Subject is forwarded as Attachment 5 (leudquarters only).
4. From LIEVOY it appears that LOCI NOV was principally
responsible for Sujoot's trajects. The 19-DA is the most likely
met subject. The 19-DA is twice LIMILD reported that LOCI NOV
left the Soviet Embassy in 19-DA at 0535 and returned at 0658 on
20 March 1966, apparently having dropped Subject off at the hotel
Agues subject's wife was not reported to have visited the Limbassy.
5. The Station had not believed that Subject would be able
to take the 21 March flight to Havana, since. there had been no
record of his having requested a Cuban visa; however, a LIONION
photograph subsequently received showed that Soviet Mice Consul
(Jadisar: Sergeyevich: NOROSUNIN (201-742341) had visited the Cuban
Embassy in person on 19 March 1966, at which time he probably
arranged for Subject's visa.

1. Subject has been identified as a KGB officer based on the
following incidents :
2. On: 12 February 1966: Aleksandr Vladimirovich: PRINHODKO
(201-202379), KBB case officer, during. a meeting with LICOZY-5,
told LICOZY-5 that he would bring Subject to the next meeting and
that Subject would be LICOZY-5. The Committee of officer.
3. During January 1966, 106 Cristohal TOKIES Ponce, shantfear
employs the Committee on Embassy in Mexico City, made several trips
to the Soviet Embassy in regard to a Soviet visa for one of the
American Embassy officials. TORRES spoke with Subject, who, after
asking whether it would get with Subject, who, and the President
with Subject, who, and the President, taking TORRES to dinner on 24 January
1966. TORRES did not meet Subject that date, and on 8 February 1966
Subject called TORRES at the American Embassy to ask why he had not
shown up. TORRES replied that he had had to work. Subject asked
whether TORRES had located for the United States. The Committee
of officer, and the President, was shown whom. he had asked had not been
interested, and Subject asked him to keep looking for someone.
Subject again called TORRES on 9 February 1966, but TORRES was out.
(It is noted that Subject's calls: to TORRES have not appcaured on

ACTION REQUIRED. METROSCO
1. LIOOZY-5 reported that on 24 June 1966 his KCB-case officer,
Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV (201-285412), stopped by his office on
legitimate business, then said he had some (operational) business for
him. LIOOZY-5 demurred, but LOGINOV went ahead, took a piece
of paper out and began reading from it, asking LIOOZY-5 ft he knew
"Eduardo WEBELMAN," LIOOZY-5 interrupted, saying he did not know the
man and did not want to do anything about him. LOGINOV sald he did not
want LIOOZY-5 to do anything, it was just that he did not know who he was.
LIOOZY-5 refused to discuss it further. When LOGINOV left LIOOZY-5's
office he felt behind a piece of paper with the following written on it in
Russian :
Eduardo Vebelman, about 55 years old, Mexicn of Jewish extraction,
owner of a steel plant and a firm which sells photographic equipment. Came
to Mexico during World War II. Lives in the Pedregal at Teololico 320.
His son is Mauricio Vebelman,

CREDWOOD/LCIMPROVE - AGB and GRU. Residencies in Mexico City
ACTION REQUIRED
1. Attached are analyses of the KGB and GRU residencies in
Mexico City. Included are only those officers who are probably
or known to be intelligence officers. Of the 52 Soviets currently
assigned to Mexico City, 22 are identified intelligence officers
and 13 probably intelligence officers, i.e. roughly 67% of the total
Soviet colony.
2. The 100 cases officers have not been divided into separate
taigct groups, with the exception of KGB S & T. the Station's
information is too fragmentary for a realistic Brakdown. With the
exception of S. S. KONSTANTINO, who is known to be the KGB resident,
the positions of resident and deputy resident are inconfrimed, but
represent the Station's best guess.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
FROM:
SUBJECT:
Ernesto CHAZARO Feregriho
1. Reference 16 made to your memorandum dated 27 June
1966 and to the interview with Subject conducted in Véfracruz on
7 July 1966 by
of your office and a
representative of this office. We wish to make the following
observations regarding Subject's statements in connection with
his encounters with Soviet Embassy Third Secretary, Valenta
S. LOGINOV.
2. Regarding Subject Subject's claim to have visited Mexico City
on or about 16 May 1966 and to have contacted the Soviet Embassy
on or about 18 May 1966, this office has established the fact that
a contact as described by Subject did not take place at any time
during the period 10 through 30 May 1966.
3. Subject make statements to the effect that he had me :
LOCINOV and a second Soviet at an unknown restaurant at 1800 hours
one. about 18 May; He claimed to have talked to these two
Soyles for approximately one hour (i.e. until about 1900 hours)
after which they left the restaurant, walked to and entered LOCINOV's
car, drove to an unknown apartment near the Soviet Embassy,
parked the car and entered the apartment and then phomed three
call-gtria who arrived within 20 minutes. Following the arrival
of the gritia Subject encuased himself and let the apartment about
1900 or 1930 hours. To our knowledge there is no precedent for
the KGB using call-gtria for the purpose and in the manner
described by Subject.

4. Subject stated that he believed that the automobile
driven by LOCINOY, an automobile that be had seen several times
bore the license number "67." Our records show that no Soviet
Embassy official or employee drives an automobile with the number
67 or 76. LOCINOY drives an automobile with Mexico City
diploratic license 19 DA.
5. Subject's statements to the effect that LOCINOY depose tied
50, 000, 00 Mexican pesos to Subject's account in the Banco de
Londres in Veracruz as a "gift
for nothing" and then took
the money back when Subject refused it, la not in keeping with
the
information that the United States has been the most important
information available to this office inclicates that according to
established Mexican banking practices it is not possible to set up
a checking account without the presence of the owner of the account
who must sign signature cards for comparison with the signatures
on checks.
6. Subject's general vagueness as to date, times,
addresses and locations in connection with this encounters with
LOGINOY, in addition to those points cited above, leads us to
the conclusion that Subject has labricated a large portion of what he
has stated. This office has little doubt that he did meet LOCINOY
in Veracruz during early May 1966 in connection with the missing
Soviet sullor, but we consider his account of contacts with LOCINOY
subsequent to this occasion as fabrication.
7. In view of the above and in view of Subject's statements
on 7 July to the effect that he had absolutely no desire to become
involved with personnel of either the Soviet or American Embasales
and wished to remain completely "neutral; this office is not
considering using Subject as an informant of any kind.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Cyr. le
FROM: ORNSKY
P-8451
SUBJECT: LIOWL-1
P-8538.
P-1267
P-11712
Below is a summary of the noteworthy items from Subject
during meetings with him in September and October.
1. During September the meeting site was changed to the
streeta between Merida and Morel on Puebla street in Colonia
Roma. Subject walks along Puebla street and I pick him up
in the car and drive elsewhere for the meeting. I attempted
to change the time of the meeting as well but Subject does
not close his store until just before 2100 hours each
day and feels that it would appear add if he were to close
the store at various times of the evening on different days
of the week. His wife is not always in the atore and be
would have to. close the store in order to meet me. He
closes at 1100 hours on Sundays. I also instructed him to
change the speed of the recorder from 1-7/8ths to 3-3/1ths.
We have no recorders in the Station that will take a large
reel at 1 7/8ths and this extremely slow speed is not
necessary.
2. During early September Subject commented that there
is a new apartment building being constructed on the corner
of Gelati and General de los Santos, across the street from
the Soviet Embassy. (This is our new baschouse). I took
considerable notes on this as though I had never heard of the

place before and asked several questions about it. He said
that the owner of the building is Sr. VILLAGRAN and that
VILLAGRAN has the reputation of being an anti-Communist
and a loyal Nexicon citizen. He said that the building
would probably be completed by Marc: 19A and that it will
have about six floors. Several Soviets have mentioned to
Subject that they would like to rent' apartments in the
building since it is so close to the Embassy.
3. Subject said that ISAYFV had been in his store about
the last week in September. (As far as I can tell this is
ISAYEVE's first visit to Subject's-store.) ISAYEV made a
great many anti-U.S. remarks during his visit to the store
and blamed the U.S. for most of the world's troubles. At one
point he said that the Soviets made much better cars than
the U.S. and that Soviet cars were built like "tanks".
Subject laughed at this remark because the thought crossed
his mind that only a soldier would like to drive a "tank".
and from where Subject was standing at the time he could
see the Soviet's' new fleet of American Fords and Chevys.
4. I again asked Subject why the Soviets had not been
visiting his store in the evenings as they had in the past
and he insisted. that it was because most of his "friends"
at the Embassy had returned to the Soviet Union beginning in
July and their replacements had not warmed up to him yet.

I asked him if a small fleata might not help this situation
and he said that he thought that it might help. I told
him to make plans for a fiesta in honor of Mexican
Independenco Day and to invite as many of the new Soviets
as possible. He said that he would probably give the
party on Friday, 17 September. I suggested that he invite
Yurly ANDRIANOV (the ORU chauffeur) first and tell ANDRIANOV
to invite several of his friends. At the next meeting with
Subject he reported that NIKIPOROV LOGINOV and KORNUSHKIN
were the only Soviets who came to the fiesta) on the 17th.
They arrived, had a few drinks, doped to some Russian
records which they had brought with them and then left.
(All are KOB types). They told Subject that the other
Soviets could not attend because they had to attend a Czech
Embassy reception that aame evening. / I can find no record
of such a reception either at the Czech on Polish Embassies
and there is no indication on the Soviet lines that they
had anything planned for that evening. A Soviet from
Cuba arrived on the 17th but we have no idea how many Soviets
were at the airport to greet him/ I questioned Subject
about the Soviets who had appreared at the fiesta and he
gave me a little information about them. They visited his
store several times in the next few weeks and I showed him
it
photographs of the men and, expanded on his previous information.
He had the following to say about them (he has previously
reported on NIKIFOROV).
LOGINOV: Subject said that he believes LOGINOV replaced

that the U.S. was a..waring nation while the Soviet Union
sought only peace and that the United States would change
to something similar to the Soviet system in the near future.
6. The rest of the meeting and the next two, were spent
discuasing Stanislev SILNIKOV and his request that Subject
act as "flador" on an apartment for him as well as supply
him with a prostitute. (see IMMMA-27568 of 4 Nov.)
7. In addition, Subject said that ANDRIANOV had asked him
to get Viktor KALININ some aphrodisiac pills. ANDRIANOV
said that they were "for Viktor KALININ in Moscow" but
Subject thinks they are "for Yuriy ANDRIANOV in Mexico".
Subject said he hasn't the slightest idea where to buy
such a thing.
8. I told Subject to test the recorder by speaking into
the microphones both in the upstairs room as well as in the
main part of the store and then to play back the tape.
Although RESCIONO has explained the workings of the recorder
to Subject several times, he claimed that he did not know
how to do this. I then instructed him to disconnect the
recorder and to deliver it to me at 2100 hours on Friday,
5 November. I said that I would test the recorder myself.
He asked why RESCIGNO could not come to the store and test
it and I told him that RESCIBNO was away. He then asked if
RESCIONO was a Mexican or an American. He said that RESCIGNO
speaks Spanish like a Mexican and looks like a'Mexican but
that he (Subject) is sure that he
an American. I told him


that I really didn't know since I had never asked him.

1. The C.O. roused acquaintancoship with Subject, and in the immediate and
siable Vacuum left by Gerald F. Castetnor's doparhure, tried to establish a
friendly rapport with Subjoct. For this reason the C.O. gave Subject a more
"friendly" naco to know him by, Hel Berger- it being explained to Subject that
Mol was the C.O.'s true first name. Subject thought the ohicon of Berger was
good, because he buman of that name, and 11 would
surprise 11 his iffine. (hould still
telepinning in, and asking for Monroy.
2. Subject reported that ho had como back to Moxico from a trip on 10 August,
1972
P-744
Nochiporenko was at the airport to greet him. Nichiporeno had voiced his
office previously, and brought along his replacement "Valentin", and at that
time had found out,when Subject was expected back. Kochiporenko was invited
by Subjoct to visit him at his home for breakfast on 11 August. He showed up
alone. The only business discased wa that Nichiporenok aoid that Subjoct
would be contacted by "Sasha" (licxander Prithedko). Subject was not to contact
the Soviet Embassy, or in any other way try to reach Sasha. Subject had a
souvenir pitotal which ho had obtioun from some Cauler/ (premanably during
WTII), and Nechiporenok asked if ho might have it. Subjoct gave it to him.
Nochiporenko evidently asked Subjoct to: arrange for a one day trip to Paris
for him while he was en route to the Swotet Union from his stopover, Brussels.
(Subjoct complied, and notified hie agent abroad. Subject received a wire a
few days ago that Nechiporenoke was "no whos" in Patic). Nechiporenoke was not
interested in Subjoct's observations of U.S. attitudes toward the Viet Nan and
Dominican situations, although Subject had been asked to note such attitudes
while he was on his trip. Neohiporenko mentioned, without Subjoct knowing why
that Catalina Torres, who had worked previously in Subjoct's office who had
attended the Mexican Soviet Cultural Institute, who had an boy Friend the American
who was giving English lessons to Neohiopereno (Gary Jodgoa?),
and who had
married some Mexican and was now in Acapillo with her husband (works at Las Brias).
would be able to contact Nechiopereno k'b mail to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico.
5. Subject is to call in when he is contoted by Sasha. His lino't the Sova
about the travel agency in New York will be that he hasn't the time to select

7. Mrs. MUELLER recently inherited some money from
an uncle, VARROS said, and this is one of her ways of
spending some of it.
8. MUELLER's daughter is studying (third-year of
college) In Vienna. She is majoring in Russian language
and Russian history there. That is where the "great
interest" in Russia comes from, VARROS said. This daughter
hopes to teach when she finishes school.

6 January 1966
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:
FROM: Oronsky
SUBJECT: LICANNY-1 (P-C415)
1. Subject is an official of Garza-Lopez Tours which
is a representative for Inturist in Faxico City. We have
had no contact with him since July 1964. At one time he
had given the Station reports on various Soviet tourists and
had been recruited prior to a trip to the Soviet Union in
connection with Inturist. During the past few months he has
been giving Don Lautz reports on various Soviet tourists
such as the Soviet Orchestra which visited Mexico and Cuba
recently. Lautz passed these reports on to me and Cynthia
sent them home. Subject sees Lautz once or twice a week
in connection with visa matters. He told Lautz that he had
been contacted by KUBARK some years ago but that due to
the pressure of his business he did not have time to write
reports or to act as some sort of Double Agent. He said he
was willing to pass along information on Soviet tourists
but did not wish to become an agent for both the Americans
and the Soviets. About a week ago Lautz told me that
Subject had reported that Valentin LOGINOV, Vice-Consul at
the Soviet Embassy, ad asked Subject to supply him with
information on boats and trains between Mexico and New York.
Subject wanted to know what he should do. I asked Lautz
if Subject wanted to talk to me and Don said that he did.
I then arranged to meet him in Lautz's office at 1420 hours
on 6 January.

thinning redish hair, blue eyes, small brown mustache.
He is well dressed and speaks native American English.
I asked him about his contacts with the Soviets and he said
that he had not had any extended contact with the Soviets
for some time. During August 1965 he was approached by
YATSKOV whom he knows as the Soviet Consul and was asked
passenger
by him to prepare a chart of all commercial (ships operating
between Veracruz and New York City "for the month of September".
He also wanted the costs of travel and baggage. Subject has
not given this report to YATSKOV. (A copy is attached.)
During December he met LOGINOV for the first time at the
airport while Subject was attending to the Soviet Orchestra.
LOOINOV did not know Subject and was very cool toward him
until YATSKOV came by and greeted Subject warmly. LOGINOV
then became very friendly and asked Subject's name. LOGINOV
subsequently visited Subject's place of business and told
him that he was the replacement for Oleg NSECHIPORENKO
(KGB Officer) and that Oleg x* had sent regards to Subject.
He said that he hoped that he and Subject would be as friendly
as Subject had been with Oleg. (Subject commented that he
had not been especially friendly with NECHIPORENKO.) Subject
said that LOGINOV's Spanish is almost native and that he
(Subject) was shocked to learn that he was a Soviet. LOGINOV
referred to YATSKOV's request and added that he also wanted
Subject to include rail travel in the chart and he was
especial'y interested in the cost of "excess baggage" by
rail. He also wanted to include sea travel from Veracruz to Europe.

3. Subject said that he did not want to become a
D/A but that he would be willing to supply xkx whatever
information he could concerning the Soviets he dealt with
willing to
and the Soviet tourists. I asked if he would be
supply personality data on LOGINOV including LOGINV's
background, education, family etc. He said that he would
be glad to do this. He said that he would not be able
to meet me on street corners or in restaurants and preferred
to talk to me after he had finished his business with Don
Tauts. I instructed him not to discuss his relationship
with me with Don Lautz or with anyone else for that matter.
Hie said that he would call LOGINOV and arrange to
give him the report and perhaps have lunch with him.
1. Subject will never be anything exceptional in the
way of an Access agent but I have asked Headquarters to
renew his POA.

Sovietas desire for Travel Data.
LIOANNY-1
A representatives of Garea Lepsi Tours, S.A. who has furnished
rolable information in the poet called on me today to report that
Mr. Legulioov of the Soviet Embassy has requested his agency to pre-
vide data on train schedules from Mexico to New York City and beat
schedules from New York City to Europe. The Soviets ware particularly
interested in the train baggage allowance and the cost for access
baggage, he said.
Loguinov io a replacement for Oleg Neigerzone who used recently
transferred from the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. My inferment do-
scribed him as tall, blond, blue-eyed, about thirty years of age, and
as a person who appeals flument Spanish without any accent.

ON 28 Deocombor I called on Kaiduldo at his residence, primarily for
the purpose of setting-up an olomentary cobpo ayston
and to
arrivo at salary arrangements with him. Salary was fixed at $50 por
month, (slightly above what Asora had suggested) ask plus 1100 allowance
during the duration of his tour here as Ambassador. As he had previously
rozouasted, I returned to his his recoipt for 35,000 poaco, which he instantly
burnt in an ashtray, with obvious relief. He commented that ho hoped ho
would never have to sign another, and it is clear that there may be some
problem in working out a poffd aoknovoldgoment. I will loavo it for later
vill cortify the 1 Jan payment, and try it on tho following month. I aokd
him if he had boon having problome with his gonscione about taking money
from the Anoricans, and he replied that he had not been able to alcoop the
night after our first payment, but after talking the whole matter over with
his wife (the strongor personality of the two) he had finally resolved it
in his mind: friends had to help one another, and if accepted the Ancrions
as such - which has always done - he should not be. too proud to let them
ball him out of a tight spot. "They were going to turn off the electricity,
and there vas only a thousand pesos left in our bank account".
Fop commo, we agreed to call in his wife and consult together. She
was more than sensible about holping, recognized both the uses and dangers
of the telephone, and made some useful suggestions. Personal contact,
based on social relationship; is the basic arrangement; either at his
house on mine. Tolephone contact to bo only between his wife and mine;
if either of the two women call and suggest seeing one another at any hour
between five and six, it means that othor I am to call on Riddle at that
time
herscy or he on me, depending on the context of the conversation. Any
other hour mentioned signifies social contact betwoon the vomen thensolvos,
who are, of course, available to pass written messages. Emergency contact

can be made by Diddle himself, calling only from a pay tolophone, nover
from his house or offices.
In regard to CE affairs, Diddle made two comments which he suggested
I might want to Olo up with Easbye
a. He asked me if I had met or talked with Noel Lindnay
(Wice President of Grant Advertising S A) at the dinner kargax Diddle gave
Christiame night, and on learning that I had, he commented that Lindsay's
outivation of him had been so assiduous that he was beginning to wonder
if he was not dealing with someone who might be visualizing himself as his
future British case officer. There was something about Lindnay, he said,
that made him fool that he was assoonsing Diddlo quito carofully. Ilo aokd
if wo could run'a file chook on Lindnay himself and on Grant Advertising.
I said I would hook.
b. Poar! Gonzales has: boon pursuing him much too actively;
aoking him to hor house out of turn, wanting to do a profile on him for the
English language Nowa; of which who is the Society Editor. What a porfoot
soover for acquiring bio data, ho oxplinod, and what odd friends oho had
for an American; (oho is listed as a US national in the Anglo-American dir-
doitory, and is, acoording to Diddld, either separated or divorced from a
Nioxian husband) nevspaper woman or not. One evening a month or so ago, ho
had gone to dinner at hor house, found most of the other guests apod on
their way rather unocromionously, and was left with only Mrs Gonales
and two men, who? he found to his surprise, were both Russians (names not
rocsailed, and never very clearly given during the initial flurry of intro-
ductions). These two engaod him in serious conversations
Ruesianes: How do you feel about Communism?
Diddle: There is something to bo said for many if not
all the important yastems under which various countries are governed; however
my primary conoornn is not with Communism in the abstract, but with the
bost way for Ghana to be governed, We must take the best of all, and fit
of
when to our country.

XEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:
PRON: Oronsky
SUBJECT: LICOWL-1
1. I met Subject on Friday, 11 February at 1900 hours. The
meeting was a very short one since I only wanted to determine
if he had found a girl for SILNIKOV to "paint". He said it
was still looking.
2. The boy who watches Subject's store at night did not
show up on 7 February and Subject was forced to sleep above
the room. The man who had a 10:00 hours on Tuesday (8 February) he
was awakened by the noise of a car horn and looked from the
window to see Valentin's. LOGINOV and Vladislav S. KORMUSHKIN
blowin the horn of their car in the driveway of the Embassy.
The house was a drum and were yelling for the gate guard
(who happened to the House. The House was a man who
They were driving car 337-D (LEONOV's) or 536-D (KORMUSHKIN's).
Subject returned to his bed and did not see them leave the
Embassy.
3. Since both LOGINOV and KORMUSHKIN live in apartments
outside the Embassy and since the woman not willing go
to have been the same. The woman it is likely that they
were working when they got drunk and therefore had no fear
of belng reprimanded for it. They may have returned to the
Embassy to make a report or to secure some classified materials
before going home: Both men relocated known KGB officers
and both work under Pavel YATSKOV.
4. I set our next meeting 24 February.

17 January 1966
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORO
KUBMRK ONLY
FROM
: COS
SUBJECT : Charles G. MUELLER, U.S. Embassy (Economics
Section) Officer
1. Reference Is made to LIENVOY (three conversations
on 12: and 13 January 1966) reports of conversations of
Subject with Valentin LOUGINOV, Soviet Embassy Officer,
and the Committee on the Committee on the Responsibility,
U.S. Embassy) with Soviets concerning a proposed visit
by Subject's wife and daughter to the USSR.
2. Paul Dillon and I advised Minister Boonstra (who
was Acting Charge) on 14 January 1966 of this proposed
visit and of the conversations we had learned about.
3. Mr. Boonstra had not previously heard of this
pomposed visit of Mrs. MUELLER to the USSR. He said he
would (without divulging CAS as the source) look into this.
4. Later on 14 January 1966, Mr. George VARROS told
me of the proposed trip. He said the Ambassador had
me finally approved: It (Mr. Boonstra later also confirmed
this)
5. VARROS. also said he thought it "not good!" for
Mrs. MUELLER to make such a trip. He said (Confidentially)
that she gets really drunk quite often and she talks
about anything and everything she knows about. For
example, she told at a party (when she was practically
"bloto") about MUELLER's"taking pictures all over Mexico.
for CIA**
6. VARROS will give Mrs. MUELLER a pre-briefing
(defensive briefing) just prior to her departure. She will
(and VARROS thinks this is wrong) be travelling on a
diplomatic passport.

the shop and after he had let the people to get a 100 feet

to SILNIKOV that the Soviet spoke very good Spanish). SILNIKOV
said that each Wednesday all the Soviets must speak Spanish and

they buy more Spanish booklets and records. SILNIKOV said that
there are some Soviets who simply refuse to learn Spanish or
Mexican customs and that these are not the only one of the
other. They were not the only one of the other. They would be a shame since Mexico
has such excellent beaches, weather and everything is so inexpensive
here. He left the shop about 1130 hrs. Subject was about to
be the most important part of the other. They were not the only one of
the stores. He asked if he could use Subject's phone and then
made a long distance call to Cournavaca and spoke to someone in
Spanish. Subject could not hear what was being said but got
the phone number - Cuernavaca 2-50-65. (I told Subject to bring
me the phone bill when it arrives so that I can double shock the

office (Auxiliar de la. Construction, SA, ligbein 168, tel:
43-31-36) on 11 March 1965 and made an appointment to see him
at 1800 on 14 March at the office. Since I had met him
socially in the fall of 1965, he remembered me which facilitated
the content of this.
1. I met with him from 1800 to 1835 at his office. He 'took
me to a back office where we conducted the conversation. I
stated my business briefly - that I knew LOGINOV was a member
of the French Club and I desired information about his activities
and contacts at the club. He was in immediate agreement to help
me in any way he could. I have him LOGINOV's full name, physical
description, type and license plate of his car and showed him
picture for the next year.
3. Subject said that he had not seen LOGINOV at the club
nor heard his name. He is sure that LOGINOV is not a tennis
player which is Subject's only occupation at the club. Subject
said the only goes there on Saturday afternoons and Sunday
mornings to play tennis. However, his wife often goes during
the last week, he was a member of the team. He was
his wife would look out for LOGINOV. At my suggestion he agreed
to make inquiries about LOGINOV from Club employees such as
the manager or the bar tender who know everybody. He agreed to
mask his interest by stating only he had heard that a Russian
was a member and to express normal curiosity about this unusual
fact.
4. Subject immediately agreed to my request that this
subject be a matter of strictest confidence between himself,
his wife and me (his wife is an American citizen whom I have met
and on whom we also have a POA) As I was leaving and thanking
him for his cooperation, he expressed his appreciation in the
confidence that I had in him in a matter of this nature.
5. Towards the end of the conversation he asked if I
worked with Al White at the Embassy. I said "no, but I know
him. He answered, "of course, you would be with counter-

invellience and he is in political work." I agreed with this.
He did not appear to be the least suspicious about Allan. He
said he knew him through their wives (cancer work) and the
children and remarked that Allan speaks pretty good German.
Other than his telling me that I work in counter-intelligence,
he did not ask any questions about my position in the Embassy.
6. Subject made a very good impression; direct, businesslike
and no nonsense. He said that he would call me in tow or three
weeks to advise the results of his investigation.

SUBJECT:
AEGELATIN, Jr.
DATE OF MEETING:
16 June 1966
1. I had lunch with Subject at the Reforma Club from
1330 to 1500 on 16 June 1966.
2. Subject immediately identified the passport photo of
BOYAROV as the "Wiktor" he had met on 4 June.
3. lhe said that our picture of LOCINOV was not 'Vasilio"
whom he described as younger and not as heavy as LOCINOV's
picture.
4. Subject reported that on 13 June ISAYEV called him at
home and asked to come by that evening. (Confirmed by LIENVOY).
ISAYEV arrived about 1930 and 1931. We put 2030, Subject
suggested that they have a Martin! ISAYEV. The report
never had one and was interested in the ingredients and how it
was put together. However, after he had drunk half, Subject
noted that he obviously did not like it. Therefore, Subject
offered him a Cuba Libra which he accepted and drank. The result
of this combination was the first time Subject has seen ISAYEV
and.
5. ISAYEV said that he had heard that Subject had had
a successful weekend fishing 3-5 June: Subject admitted this
vold then sounded off about how rude YATSKOV had been (drinking
vold in front of Nick and his friend, refusing to come to Nick's
for a second year, but the first time, friend in, anger at Nick's
success, etc). ISAYEV merely shrugged with the
mentioned that he had met the new man "Wiktor", "BOYAROV",
had spoken a few words of English with him and thought he was
very nice. ISAYEV answered that although "Wiktor" was not a
fisherman, he had enjoyed seeing the Mexican countryside and
particularly the scenery at Pucuato. They did not discuss the
third Soviet, "wasitic.

6. ISAYEV asked what his fishing plans were. Nick said
that he was 30 busy with his many problems at the now plant that
he would not be going fishing during June. Nick then suggested
that he would not be going fishing. I July. However, he added "but
just you and me. Don't bring a little friends like that rude
Pablo (YATKOV)... ISAYEV answered "Not even Anatolly (KARABACHI?"
Nick answered that Anatolly was okay and he could come. This
date is tentative and will be confirmed.
7. ISAYEV remarked zhat his wife and child were in
Cuernavaca and that KARABACHI's wife would go down on the weekend
of 18 June leaving them both bachelors. Nick facetiously
remarked that he would have to organize some wcme: for them.
8. Nick asked ISAYEV about the Soviet volleyball temn.
ISAYEV said that he had been heavily engaged in working with them.
No was with the team for each game, then went out with them to
dinner, took them to the hotel; etc. and didn't get home nights
unlike.
9. Nick brought up the point that ISAYEV had never invited
him to his house. ISAYEV, definitely uncomfortable and searching
for words, said that he hadn't invited them because his wife
thought that there was too big a contrast between Nick's home
and theirs. That Nick was "rich" with lots of beautiful things
and the most important, but he's having inherited undistinguished
furniture from his predecessor, but he's not the most important
stating that friendship is what counts and the circumstances
of one's home meant nothing. ISAYEV ended by saying rather
gameiy that he would invite Nick to his home. Nick said that
from ISAYEV's words and discomfiture, it was obvious that he
is ashamed to invite anyone to his house.
10. Pánally, Nick said that it was his impression that
ISAYEV had absolutely no immediate plans to return to the USSR
and Nick feels that he will be here until November or December.

Nick KOURCHENKO, Jr.
DATE OF MEETING:
7 June 1966
1. I met Nick at his apartment from 2030 to 2200 in
order to debrief him on the fishing weekend of 3-5 June.
2. Nick reported that when he and his Mexican friend
arrived at Pucuato at 1845 on Friday, 3 June, YATSKOV and
two other Soviets were already there fishing in front of the
cabins. They had come in ISAYEV's YW. Shortly thereafter
the Soviets came to the cabins and Nick greeted YATSKOV and
the boys who were not the most concerned about the produce
the other two Soviets by name but they all did shake hands.
Nick invited them all into his room but only YATSKOV came
He accepted a drink and. left with it. Later outside Nick
and the boys who were Soviets his name and got the other
"Vasilio." The company was a very good man who had and Nick
asked if he spoke English. This Soviet said his name was
Vlitor and that he spoke a little English. Nick then asked
YATSKOV which of the other two was the newly arrived Soviet.
YATSKOV said that it was Viktor. Nick then lent them his
extra kind of work. He was a very good man who was
extra. He was the next day both groups fished separately at
Sabanita. About noon YATSKOV came by and noticed that Nick
was having luck so he brought the other two Sovs to a spot
immediately adjacent. They stayed about an hour, didn't
have any luck and left. They met again that evening at the
society. The most important role of the military, but he receives
none. YATSKOV was upset, jealous and even angry. Nick then
invited Viktor in for a drink. Viktor did the same as YATSKOV,
took the drink with him. YATSKOV said that the Soviets would
leave Sunday morning since they had no luck. Nick left
early Sunday morning for fishing. He later learned from the
owner that the Soviets had left fairly early Sunday morning.

English. However, their dispersion was so limited that Nick
couldn't determine his fluency. He obviously understood
everything that Nick said but his answers and comments were
short and simple. As noted above, YATSKOV said that he is
the newly arrived Soviet. He did not do any fishing himself
but not a man who was not going to be a man.
6. I showed Nick a picture of BOYAROV. Nick couldn't
positively identify it. Our picture has sunglasses. During
the day Viktor had on a white towel protecting his neck and
a wide hat but no sunglasses. At night Nick saw very little
of him and it was dark. However, Nick did say that our photo
is a very good person. He was a very good person. He was a
photo of GAZIYEV and he said that this was definitely not
a
Viktor. (COMMENT: Since GAZIYEV and BOYAROV are the only
new Soviets in town, and Viktor spoke English, he has to be
BOYAROV. But why did he use the nano Viktor when his name
is Vitality.)
6. The "Visualism" : About 28-32 years old, medium to dark
blond curly hair, medium height, very good athletic build,
tough and strong appearance, the all-American boy type.
Speaks pretty good Spanish but not as well as ISAYEV or YATSKOV.
There are only two Vasilys at the Embassy; BUTSEV and
MIRUSNIKOV, but neither comes any where near the above
description. (COMMENT: Nick's description of "Vasilis" fits
LOGIONV to a "T." However, his name is Valentin and not
assilvly. I will show Nick pictures at the next meeting.)
8
Previously Nick has met 8 Soviets, all in true name
(mostly by first name only). Thus it is strange that BOYAROV
and LOGNOV should use phony names.

2.
The following day, 14 after, Loinew are to Subly office. The asked Subj how
that trip (to Euroro) had been and specifically asked if Subj had seen Ginetto
Placcei Porter. Subj replied that he had found out that Ginetto and hor hurband
vere vascinioning in Italy.
Loinew asked what in reosived in Nurecy on Zrunco's backing
out c: AATO. Subj answered that he had aolion to anro including
Gcorzo Lajero of Air France, who enciadered in general that de Gaulle was not
wrong, but that his way was too drastic, that he was annoying everyone, and that
Nince could not be isolated.
Then Subj made his brack-off announcement to Lexirov, saying Dut- I'm sorry
to tally you that I'm not going to be able to work with you any more. There
are several reasons. Loinov asked if anything had happened. Subj replied he
had reacona. Loinov asked what they were. Subj said he was tired; he had a
lot to do; and frankly he was plain disappointed- thore had been big deals
planned, nothing happened, and he was doing just junk. Loinov asked if that
was Subjia final decision. Subj andi yea. The Soviet then asked if they could
talk it over. Subj said certainly, any tivo. Thercuron it was agreed between
thom that they would meet half an hour before the expected arrival at Loxico
Airport of the 1011111127 creip cening to Loxico. They would meet in the restaurant.
Subj told Loinov ho hid troveled with Abo Dacarov, and that they had become
very friendly. And he asked Loinov if he rinded, that he asm the Abm again.
Loinov said not at all but not to call the inb at the Soviath or use the phone
for any calls to the SOWIb.
As ottated in para. 1 above, the LUNUST delegation did not arrive on 19
Am, and Subj who know of the postioncent did not go to the airport, and
consequently niased his meet with Loinov.
3. Subj, in his cuctocary way asked "did I do right". The C.O. said it was
fine if Loinov cot the no-nonsense idea that Subj was throught. The C.O. told
Subj to wait until the Sova. cet in touch with his again, and to have thoir
accend meet, at which Subj again maies perfectly clear that he is through. IIO
is to roanin friendly thouch, and is free to do anything he wishes re establishing
contact with the Soviet Acbassador, Subj said he would under any circumstances.
postpone his met with Lacinov until at lccat the night of 23 AT when the

and told the agent to accept the offer. Agent again saw subject on
21 July, last, and was given his first "assignment" by subject.

Paul:
1. I have revieved the entire LOCINOV file and have made copies
of all pertinent LIEVCKI clips for the following P files and have
included a note to that effect in each of these files:
Miriam AVILA Kats
P-581
Scoorro FLORES
P-12259
Salvador PAZ Plata
12775
Erika KAMERMAN
P-12843
2. Attached hereto are copies of all the clips I found on the
other people included on the list you gave me.
A. Besides the 11 April clip on Dr. Juan Luis ALVAREZ Gallou
I found a 12 Jul 66 call from Joes Luis ALVAREZ Cayou, probably at
least related if not the same person. This is the only name on which
other
there area any/possibly identifiable traces:
(1) According to a 28 June 1961 LITEA Contact report,
Jose Luis ALVAREZ was one of the students in the Tuesday
and Thursday, 7 to 8:30 p. m., Russian language classes at
the IICHR during the months of February and March.
(2) HN-6018, dated 17 November 1961, based on information
from LIEVCKI Dist C, reported that one Jose Luis ALVAREZ was
a member of the MN Committee of Micho con.
(3) In a 30 November 1961 Legal Attache report one
Jose Luis ALVAREZ of Morelia, Michocon, was named as one who
assisted the National Liberation Movement in Mexico.
(4) HN-20810, dated 1 March 1963, included the following
information from: LIEVCKI POHIM: "One Jose Luis ALVAREZ (matronyanie
unknown) is putting items in the 'Voa de la Universidad'. (Univer-
aided Autonora Nacional de Mexico) for the Czechs. KUBATA,
the Charge d'Affaires in the Czech Embassy praised ALVAREZ
for his reports and said 'we will give you money and material
to help support the magazine'. ALVAREZ also works on the
University's 'Periodico do la Universtad" (newspaper).
(5) HN-27516, dated 27 October 1965, provided an 11
October 1965 listing, again based on LIEVCKI information, on


which the name of Jose Luis ALVAREZ was again included as an
active member of the MN and a member of the State Committee
of Morelia, Michoacan, which had its general offices at Guillermo
Prieto 35-10 in Morelia.
b. About Gloria ALFAÑO; I wonder if one may not be related
teacher at the UNAM Economics School and
to Ofelia ALFAÑO Lopes (P-11339)/ Friend of Antonio CANHENTO (P-12703)
and his wife, Violeta. Both OClola, ALFAÑO and LOCI NOV attended a
Christina party at the SANWLENTO's last year (pertinent alips included
with the Gloria ALFAÑO material attached). In the 22 June 66 conversation
Gloria ALFAÑO had with LOCI NOV ahe mentions having met him at Christmas
time.
c. Copies of all of LOCI NOV's contacts with the Instituto
de Interpretes y Trauutoùrora; including the one which mentioned
are attached.
Senorita HARVANDEZ/ Other people connected with that outfit are:
Lio KKEISIN
Sarita Inu
Jacobo Chensinski
3. Besides the names on your list I also found two clips on
Margaret (Hagre) FROR who seems to be on quite familiar terms with
LOCI NOV. I have included copies of them also:
4 Note that all of the calls in question are incoming calls:
Also to each of these people nothing is mentioned about classes.

26 Juno 1966
SUSUZION: Conrect Renbrt/ LICCEY-5
25 June 1130/1215, Subj'a office
1. In recenca to a call-in by Subd. the C.O. went to 200 Subi on Saturicy
scanning 25 June;
2. Subj reported that Vlentin Lignor had dropped in to the office on 24 Juno
to make arrangements for a return trip to the Soviet Union for (Nicola) Lecov,
the, Lecivin seid, had to be in l'ecow at the latest 4 July. Subj said ho
would try to handle. /Comment: Leginov said he would ecco by the office on
27 Juno with Lecov's preceptor, because there was the likthlood that Subj
would attempt to got a KLI flight for Lecov via Houton (requiring a U.S. visa
for Lconov). In any event, Subj told the C.O. that ho rao not going to the
U.S. Tastery to request the visa, But would back the whole problem to KLM who
would have to make my visa arrangements that were required/.
3. Interestingly chouch, Leginov took the opportunity to bring up operational
sattora again to Subj, and Subj used the ensuing discussion to make his stance
utterly clear to Leginov. The conversation want more or less as follows:
Leginov said: "You're mad et me." Subj said: "Thy should I be ncd at you?"
Liglové said: "Gecause of Majestic" (roteming to the fact that the Sove had
first given a travel request to Vajsea l'ajestic to bo serviced). You block wo
have to spread it around aichong friends" Subj shrugged this off. Then Leginov
asked: "No you still mad?"
Subj replied: "I'm not mad, and I never was. Lock, Valentin- " (and then
he made his first attempt at clarification, saying in effect that in normal
friendly rattors they wore like brothers Subj exaggerated as is his memor-
nconteming intinato tiettes like "marriage" and. "even unto death@nata la marte)" but
but saying that what was the culmination point- "anything also" was finished).
Leginov said (without batting an cya): "It had seme business for you."
Subj cut him short: "Don't bring me anything important or not important- you
can kcoq it. You want to go for ocojoc; you want to go out with girls; - with
much pleasure; cuything up to that point. And I sent you to underatand that
clearly. Don't force no; and lot'a be good friends." Leginov said: "You're
getting difficult."
Subj replied: "No, I'm not difficult. And there's no damage. I endo my
decision - and your chiefa will understood by position."
P-2712


2.
Loginov tried again: "I good friend of youra was appointed Chief of the
U.S. Travel Service - Paul Giérce- ho's a fricilism of yourc"
Subj becane a little heated in reply: " Yec, he's a good friend. I will
always to cloco to him. But you got this very clear- cry plans you have for
Paul Giérce, forcct. about them, is that olcer? I won't do a colden thins
I
hope you understand that. Wore friend (you and I), but becido. being friends-
reroid!"
Loginov took out a piece of paper and started to read from it, asking
Subj if he knew the man "Eundaro Vebolzen approximately 55 years old- a Nexica
386." (Attached is a photocopy of the pico of paper Lecinov had been reading,
and which he left behind on Subj's deck apparently by mistake. It's in Russian,
and Subj is not able to translate completely at first glance. Subj plans to
return the original to Lecinov when ho. caces by on 27 June.) While Lcinov was
reading, Subj aid insistotly: " I don't know the man, and I'le not going to do
anything
L'oginov replied. "I'm not aking you to do anything - it's just
that I don't know (about him). About Paul Giódro, he's a good friend of yours
Subj said: "Forcot it."
4. Subj asked to C.O. - "did I do wrong" Tho C.O. replied that Subj had acho
bectitifully- but he has to expect that tho Sosv will keep up all kinds of
pressures- subtle, snail, or oven great, and not so subtilo. But, tho way is clear-
all he has to do is say "no."
Subj said that Lecinov had brought him a box of "Punch" cigara (Cohen), and
Subj is usual offered to pay, but Lecinov preceded them on him. Subj then said
to the C.O. ho wanted an exprecion of policy on how he should handle that kind-
of thing from the Sosv- take the gifts, after offering to pay? refuse outright?
The C.O. said we would give the guidance he needed for that situation.
5. The C.O. will drop around to Subj's office carly next wook.
Addendum the C.C. told Subj that there was a minor that Olen, hechiporroko
was seen around them. Subj said ho knew of nothing on that score, but cubbted
it strongly- since he was sure Oleg would have contacted him. The C.O. under-
scordd that Subj do nothing about the minor.

W. I asked Subject if he had mentioned SILKING's pornographic negative
to the latter. As First Subject said no, then you that he had asked
Bilntbox about it but Bilnlikov said that the negative didn't belong to him
but to Vailtly who took it back to Moscow with him. Subject added that Vasily
had returned to the USB8 about two weeks ago. (Comment: This is most probably
HUSBW whom Subject calls Veadily and who returned to the US$8 on 24 July.)
(Second Comment: This is another example of one of Bilnikov's vulnerabilities
evaporating into thin air).
5. Concerning the item in the notes for Saturday, 30 July, in which
Bilnikov hid an the ballroom for twenty minutes because two other Soviets
came in, Subject had the following to say about these two Soviet
a. Valentin (21 Error), then follows a perfect description of
LOXION.
b. Valimir here follows a good description of KORAKISHKIN including
the fact that he replaced KOSTIKOV. O. yL KORAKISHKIN name is Vinalalav,
not Vladimir.
6. I asked Subject about the discrepancy in the 19 July meeting when
he said that SILKING and PRAISCHIKIN had come to the store on Saturday
16 July but his notes said that PRAISCHIKIN and his replacement is: He also
designed to be the door at know who PRAISCHIKIN's replacement is: He also
couldn't explain the discrepancy, stating that he couldn't remember the
incident now.
7. I also asked his about his 1st of 21 July in his act the request
of VALITHK is had delivered two cases of repreacos to General Cono 32. (We
have no Bovieta at this address). He changed it to General Leon 30 (MUTIN's
home and the film office). The VALENTIN noted above is LOLLINOV, then Subject
delivered the tio cases only 5 Soviet woman was at home. The described this
address as a single house which is undergoing renovation inside.
8. In discussing SILKING's recent work finding up the Embassy I asked
who actually did the work. Subject said that the Soviets do not like to deal
with established firms for represre to the Embassy because they charge too
much. They prefer to deal with small independent people whom they can beat
down on the price. Subject knows of the such individuals

MEMO FOR RECORD
in his monthly report for August 1966, LICALLA said TAYSKOV seem ed to
have taken PINKIUKOKO's place. When I asked why he thought that, he
answered :
PINKIOKOKO is not here (he left 28 June on home leave). PINKIOKO had
been entering the Fimany through the main door and was soon working in
window # 22. Now TAYSKOV is entering through the main door and was
soon working at this window. TAYSKOV also had the same contact with
KIKIPUROV which PINKIOKO had previously had. Now that TAYSKOV has
also left (4 Aug), LICALLA thinks that LOCIHOY is probably taking his
place. (This last statement is not cleari whether LOCIHOY is taking
TAYSKOY's place in TAYSKOY's old job, which would be most lociela. Or
whether LICALLA thinks LOKIOW may now be in the PINKIOKOKO job. In any
case, PINKIOKO himself should be book conentarily.)

Lurpeon refucee' mid a Jew. And more, he had never professed to them any ideological
surrenty to the Corunist cause. The root he had done was to declare that the
Soviets represented the wave of the futuro, and he wanted to be on the winning, side.
that he must recezince that such sentiment coming from a Jew could hardly have
convired the Soviets.
b) Next state of appreach to Soviets in Vexico:
The C/O suggested to Subj as an effective way to break off from the Soviets
that he should tros only all affirmations or "friendship - cut out the
"nata la morte". bit. Subj, in turning down any and all Soviet requests for
information or assistance, should couple it with the open deceleration that he has
quit.
Subj arced to follow this line, except for the qualification pertaining to
his presence in Tocore.
a) Clarify status of Leningov as "Conul's

Then the C/O related the way he had reported Prikhode's question and Subj's.

He recasted the conversation as follows:
Prikhodeo "Diec will be the best way to lecaize (a tourist in Yexico)?
Subject : "You know the ansarea."
Prikhodeo: "If you would have to put (a man in your office), would you be able to?"

CONTACT REPORT
SUBJECT:
Ernst GOEBEL
DATE OF MEETING:
8 September 1966
1. I met with Subject at his office on 8 September 1966
from 1730 to 1800. Next meeting is in about two weeks to be
arranged by phone.
2. Subject reported that LOOINOV still comes fairly
regularly to the French Club on weekends. Occasionally he brings
his wife. Once or twice he brought two young Soviet men in
their early twenties. He has also brought a Soviet woman ca
25 who has played tennis with two other women (club members)
whom Subject doesn't know. Subject hasn't seen GORLITSYN since
our illness.
3. Since LOIGINOV doesn't play tennis but only sits around
outside or in the bar, Subject doesn't see him for sustained
periods. Subject has seen LOIGINOV talking to SARMINETTO or his
wife. two or three times. From observing him in the bar, subject
saw that LOOINOV is on speaking terms with several members.
4. I asked Subject if he knew Ofelia ALFARO Lopez (P-11339)
a good. friend of the SARMINETTOs and also in contact with the
SARMINETTOs, said that: recognized her name as a club member. When
I told him that he was a member of the SARMINETTOs, he was
remembered that at a dinner party at the home of Henry *STEGMANN,
an American and local head of Continental oil Co., a Mexican
woman was present who was a professor of Economics. She speaks
of the American community, and he was a member of the SARMINETTO
ALFARO but is not sure. He will check his wife who is the name
rememberer in the family.
5. Subject remarked that he found the above dinner strange
for its odd mixture of solid busiáess types and a few off-beat
"bestnik" Mexican types including the female professor. He
hastened to assure me that SIEGMANN was a sterling character.
6. For the next meeting Subject will attempt to confirm
ALFARO's identity and also to spot likely club members who
appear to be an close terms with the SARMINETTOs with the view
of getting an assessment of the latter.
7. Subject is interested and willing. However, he does
not appear to be very much interested in people: Thus he has
played tennis with SARHIENTO for years and hasn't a thing to
say about him except that he is a pleasant tennis companion.
Similarly SARHIENTO's wife is good looking and a good player.
8. I haven't had an opportunity to talk with the Project's wife
yet. He was a member of the SARMINETTOs.
I met his wife last fall and noted that she is much more alert,
interested and lively in social relations than he is. Therefore
I bet that she knows a lot more than he gives her credit for.
I intend to invite them to dinner soon in order to talk with the
wife and explore possibilities.

7 Sept, a few minutes, Sears Ejorito Nacional
8 Sept, 1100-1200, Subj's office
1
J. On 7 Sept at about 1100: the C/0 made a routine call to Subj's office to determine
if Subj would be available that day. Subj responded that he was glad that the c/o
had called because he had to see him urgently. In charnoterietio manner Subj trying
doublotok told the C/o that he had received a telegram, that his old friend (Prikhodko)
was back, and that he was going to see the "two of them". (Prikhodko and Loginov) at
1500 that day at the Flor de Mexico. The C/0 was juszled by the reference to the
telegrams, and asked incredulously if the telegram had anything to do with setting
up the meeting with his friends. Subj's answer was ambiguous, and the C/o let it
go at that because he arranged a brief most with Subj for 1230 at Sears Restaurant,
at By-rotto Nacional, where Subj was to be on his own business at that time.
2. Haverthelca, in considering the briefing instruction to cive to Subj the C/o
had to allw for the fact that there might have been special circumstances in
the Soviets' arrangement for their meet with Subj. Further, this was Prikhodko's
first meet with Subj after return from Moscow, where it is presumed he had taken
up Subj's case with his superiors and the lino decided on hew to deal in the future
with their finging, non-cooperative "agent." A reasonable contingency expectation
was that the Soviets might have a "hot" proposition to make to Subj, and the C/o
decided to brief Subj to the extent that if the Soviets broached a really important
opporational assignment, which Subj was to judge, Subj would conduct himelf so as
to draw out the Soviets but it call on acceptance. If nothing of overriding operations
come from the Soviets, Subj was to continue his "friends-yes" work-no" attene.
At 1230 the C/o aw Subj for just a few minutes, during which, the telegram
was explained. it was from Moscow, inviting Subj's travel agency to participate
in a eeminer in Koncoo 24-29 Oct 1966, detailed letter to rollow. Further, Subj
had learned from Prikhodko when the latter had called earlier in the morning to
make the appointment for the meet that afternoon that Prikhodko was aware of the
invitation and would talk to Subj about it at their meet. The C/O imparted to
Subj the briefing outlined above; stressing that Subj must judge whether the
Soviots were proposing auching that was so important that he couldn't dirisis
it out of, hand - in which case he was to be non-committal and sall on a decision
3. The C/o had communicated to the Station the tack he was going to take, and
was later informed by the Station to reverse the planning of Subj's attitude toward
a contingency proposition of the Soviets to a flat, unconditional "no."

According-ly, the c/o tried to reach Subj at his office. Subj was not there
so the c/o left a message to be given to Subj if he should arrive before 1500.
Tho message was " En el negocio con sus amigos debería usted docir "no" a todo."
The message purported to oceo from "Seclor Berger."
In a telephone call to Subj at 1850 that evening the C/o learned from Subj
that nothing of transoending importancs had occurred at his meet with the Soviets,
and so. the C/0 arranged to meet with Subj the following day 8 September
14.
4. On 8 Sept. Subj reported that he had met Prichidoko and Legionov at 1500 the
preooding day in the Flor de Mexico Restaurant. Prichidoko did most of the talking.
He brought Subj the two kilos of caviar that Subj had requested (and-paid for).
He said he had had a good leave in the Soviet Union, and that the wedding (of his
son) had gone off all right. He had spoken with Nechipperoke (who is still in Moscow
and with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) who sent his regards to Subj and also four
Russian records. He had seen Pavel Taitkov in Moscow who told him that he had met
Subj in Paris. Yatokov would be returning to Mexico about 17 September 1966. El the
Prichidoko. or Legincv told Subj that Legionov was now the Soviet Conduil in Mexico.
Leginov told Subj that he would pass by Subj'a office on Monday (12 Sept).
They discussed the invitation to the travel agents to come to Moscow. Prichidoko
boid that twelve INTERIST representatives in Mexico had been invited, that ho had
the telegram and that he was going to coordinate the arrangements for the travel
agents to attend the conference, (Cosmant. The telegram dent to Subj in Spanish on
6 September 1966 andia: "there will be a conference 24- 29 October in Moscow of
travel agencies that collaborate with INTURIST dealing with international turium
we invite your agency a reduced price for the stay will be afforded; a detailed
letter follows." Prikhodko asked Subj if he thought of attending the conference.
Subj said he could like to go (and added with a trinkie) - "only from a business
student,."
Prikhodko, For his part, in thin reference to Subj's uncooperative attitude
1
said that Subj had put him into a hard spot with his superiors in Moscow. And now
he would have to consult with Moscow to. see whether Subj can attend the travel agent
conference, Subj asked archily "By letter". Prikhodko replied "You're crazy-
everything goes by cable," Subj stated "You can refuse me a visa." Prikhodko
dismissed that, saying that if Subj goes to Moscow he will be met Prikhodko's
colleagues, and that if Subj is in Moscow the doctors there would be happy to
chook into Subj's health (a matter mentioned praviously with both Legionov and
Prikhodko). Subj, responding somewhat mockingly to this expression of concern
by the Soviets, said he was still their friend' and one of them.

Trichinato then remarked something to the offect that Subj now didn't want
to do anything for thea -what with his bad health and being tied up in neanioas-
but that maybe in the future and then got very much into the present by
riding canily into the old groove he said "I talked/58u several times about
a man coming tourist to Mexico - what is the beat way to arrange legal residence-
could it be done through your office - he could be attached to your office- he
doesn't have to work there."
/Comments: Subj explained to the 0/0 that ho sensed the trap immediately, reconciling
that this was the old bent of the Soviets on which he had furnished a wealth of
information in the past. Subj reasoned that if the Soviets were fishing with the
old habit, he would not rise to it egorly because in view of his recent noo
cooperative behavior it would only confirm to the Soviets that he was being
controlled (by the AIS). Ho would not reject the inaunination of his cooperation
out of hand and categorically, because that would not be consistent with his posture
of remaining on friendly torca with the Soviets. Therefore he took the middle road,
that of being non-committal or unomnitted, where the initiative of compliance was
always in his hands. Parimethically, Subj told the 0/0 that if the "logic" is
that of conpoente to rojection of the Soviets he should not have oven net them but
following the policy of "hasta la muerte- amigos, pero hacer nada" he felt he was
doing the right thing in atringing them along a barren path. Thus, without batting
an, eye ho simply repeated what he had already told them. Subj said he would have
to commit. Copormacin- because he didn't know if his company had the required
capitalization to place a forecmer in a job - but this being Mexico, anything could
probably be done. /Comments: Subj remarked to the 0/0 at this joint that the Soviets
could not seriously consider wing Subj's firm to "legolize" their man, because
it would be a potent fraud to the employees in his firm, and he did not think the
Soviets were stupid about such things/.
The 0/0's summary comment to Subj's unspoken plea for criticism of his curse
of action was that under the concept of a "friends, yes; work, no" policy toward
the Soviets he was doing a fine job of walking the tightrope.
5. The 0/0 asked Subj if there had been any travel arrangements for non-Sviets
to the Soviet Union. Subj replied that Julio Rothenstreich, whom Subj characterized
as a German Jew, and his wife, a Russian Jew, had left 5 Sept to New York en rate
to the Soviet Union. Subj said Rothenstreich had told him that he was friendly with
the Soviet Ambassador in Mexico and represented "Russian firms" (aio). He was to
remain in the Soviet Union 15 days and visit a few cities, Mecson, Kiev en Lougher
and then some cities in Europe, Vienna and Paris, Subj said that Rothenstreich's

own fira was making the hotel reservations in the Soviet Union for him. Subj said
he had met once before with Rothenstreich years ago, but didn't know anything about
him.
Subj also mentioned a widower in his airties, David Nosofaky, who loft for
the Soviet Union on 1 32° - Nosofsky has a brother in Kier.
6. The C/O had noticed a now face, among Subj's employees and asked Subj who the
girl was. Subj explained that he had taken on the new girl, Leticia Cineroro, the
daughtor of one of Subj's guides in Mexico, as possible replacement for Mirion
Avilia Katz, who has an offer to work for the Israeli Embassy in Mexico. Subj said
his would not want to lose Miriam because, even though she is a slow worker, she is
capable and also a nice girl. If Miriam should leave, Leticia would take over
her work- (which includes the responsibility for non-Soviet travel to the Soviet Union).
7. The C/O quantized Subj about his atti due toward attending the travel agent
conference in Moscow. Subj said that from a business standpoint he would want to
attend, or if not him percaunly somcone from his firm, like Miriam. He was
interested in INTRUST business, and felt that he should know what plans INTRUST
will be formulating inasmuch as his compactitors will be there. He is interested
to know what percentage he gota of INTRUST business. He believed that INTRUST
would foot 50% of the costs of staying in the Soviet Union during the conference.
The C/O asked if Subj knew the other travel agencies that were to be invited. Of the
twelve from Mexico Subj felt that the following were included: Garza, Garza Tours,
Do Carlo Tucar, Majeas Kelia, Cook's, Nexanierica, Pegaso, Excursiones y Viago (SVISA),
American Express, and possibly Autoviajes Internacionales. Subj knew the "jefesa" of
all: these.
Subj plans to attend the International Congress and Convention Association
meeting in Israel on 30 October 1966. He is considering the possibility of going
to Moscow for the travel agent meeting 24-29 Oct and then going on to Tarsal.
The C/O told Subj to let him know Prikhodko's results re permission for Subj
to attend the Kioscow meeting.
8. Subj requested the C/O to obtain one case each of Red, White and Rouse French
wine, the "best" available.

3. Concerning the big day, 21 August, Subject had the
following to any in addition to the information in his notes.
This information was An response to my questions :
a. They left the store at ca 1410 and stopped off to got
Barbecued aichen (COMMENT: they didn't actually arrive at LICOWL's
until 1307.
b. They went in a blue Station wagon (COMMENT: this
is 17 DA).
c. The Soviets left at ca 1800 (COMMENT: correct).
d. Besides LICOWL and his wife and the two Soviets,
only LICOML's daughter and son-in-law wore present.
3. Later on in the meeting Subject volunteered the
information that LICOWL had told him that he had obtained
permission to cono to LICOWL's home (COMMENT: Strangto coudet
and his wife and his wife and his wife and his wife and his wife
also volunté that he had cold SILNIKOV that LIGIONV hid called
a girl from us score on Saturday (See Subject's notes for 20
Augues), SLLNIKOV's reaction was one of approval, noting that
LIGIONV was a infcholor now. I asked Subject if he didn't think
that he had a good chance to do with the first time.
LICONV, especially since SILNIKOV has now shown an interest
in security measures. He said I was right but it was obvious
that this aspect didn't bother him in the least either before or
after my question.
7. I aticed Subject what ho thought about SILNIKOV's erratic
behavior about wanting women, pornographic material, etc. in that
the first time, he was a very good thing. He was a very good
Subject ansurced this by proposing that we send a girl under our
conrol to visit his store and he would introduce her to
SILNIXOV (CO: :nect/ly what we are trying to do with LIIUSTIC-1)
I pointed out that such a girl would have to live in the neighbor-
ing of the man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man
that the girl could be invited to his home at a time when he
SILNIKOV was there Subject would introduce her as a friend
from Jalisco and let nature talk its course. I told him that his
suffering his mother, he was a man who is a man who is a man
in a secure manner. I remarked that it was a shame that he had
been unable to come up with suitable candidates in his. neighborhood.
He snid that he in many suitable friends in the neighborhood
but that more suitable since they weren't the types to
when he could suggest such an idea. I told him that he couldn't
but we could, 31 he would spot suitable candidates.

the C/O that he felt strong in his capacity to deal with the Sorists, and that
his Joking remarks in noa way utilized that strong
the C/O's own, but he was able to get the "good" and that Joginow he would supply
his personal documents to Loginow, and (solely with the design of reaching for
Subj's motive) stated that we thought it would be better if Subj did nothing
to pass those documents to the Sorists and held them off indefintitely. Subj
had to be a good thing to the C/O's own, but he was able to get the "good" and
wanted to give those "bostards" his documents to show them he had nothing to
hide, and that he was not afraid of them; if he didn't give over his documents
they might think they had something on him. Further he felt that he was buying
insurance by handing them over only, and gave us an example that he might be
a good thing to the C/O's own, but he was able to get the "good" and that he
like Prague or 'Naraw' and it would be a comfort to him to find a
to be afraid of concerning any irregularities in his past.
Therefore, Subj asked the C/O to check with his "bosses" to see if he could

later told him not the attempt to pick up any more paper since it
is not worth the risk.
3. I then revieved the SGSWIL examination with him. I told
him that because of his lies and exaggerations, none of his previous
information was considered valid and that rather than "being more
useful to us" his material had meant a lot of work for nothing. I
told him that I would give him another chance and that we were
not to have a good sense of thought my talk he was quite un-
comfortable. He did not try to defend himself but simply agreed
to whatever I said. Although he handled me for the second chance
he did not appear to be too contrifled.
4. Following are the few interesting items from his notes :
a. On 12 December at ca 1700 KORMUSHIN came in with another
Soviet. KORMUSHIN asked Subject when he was going to invite him
to his home for a drink. Subject suggested Sunday, 18 December.
They agreed to meet at the store at 1500. Subject described the
other Soviet as a young diplomat ca 29-30 with a thin build who
had been a very good and more than 100% of the country. The
already here when NECHIPORKNO was here) and went to the fiesta
at Subject's home which was attended by NECHIPORKNO and NOSTKIOV
and wives. (COMMENT: I remember a report on this fiesta but can't
find it anywhere). Subject asked me for instructions, dinner, girls,
and women were not a very good and more than 100% of the thought
other guests and offer them only liquor and snacks. Subject is
to determine KORMUSHIN's motive in asking himself to Subject's
home. By the way whenever Subject has mentioned KORMUSHIN in the
last few months he has invariably remarked that he is a very heavy
drinker.
b. On 6. December LOOINOV came in from 1250 to 1242. He
had preferent to be a very good and more than 100% of the Soviets to find a
house for their school. This time he asked about the now (LILYRIC)
building - how much an apartment costs (1500 MN), who lives there
(chemical engineer in penthouse (LILYRIC), a German family on the
second floor, etc. LOOINOV's questions were general and so were
Subject's answers.
c. On Saturday 3 December 1966 SILINKOV came in from 1412
to 1430. He asked for two receipts of ca 5 MN each for bread, saying
that the number of people were subject thinks he uses these small
sums to buy beer and grille magazines. SILINKOV then leafed through
a girlie magazine and then said he wants Subject to find him a girl
for whose favors he is willing to pay 100 MN. (COMMENT: chiseling
10 MN in false receipts and in the next breath offering 100 MN
for a girl?)

who put into contact with HLANCO by another Bovlot, probably
WECHIPOBRERO or YATSKOV. It is interesting to note that, although
CASAKANDO has been in contact with RICHIPORIKKO and BLANCO has
been in contest with LOUIROY, there is no previous indication
that either have TATSKOV. YATSKOV is the MD chief of both
MICHIPORIKKO and LOUIROY.

DATE OF MEETING:
21 November 1966
1. I picked Subject up at the corner of Nilo and Melchor
Ocammo at 1100 on 21 November 1966. The meeting was held in my
car on a side street and lasted 50 minutes. I paid Subject R00 MN,
his salary for November 1966. Next meeting is for 1100 on 1
December at the above place. Subject will be given an SGSWIRL
examination. The meeting was held in my car on 21 November 1966.
2. Subject didn't have a word to say about LOGOINV's attempt
to recruit him. When I asked about it, he said he thinks that
LOGI NOV is out of town since he hasn't seen LOGI NOV since his
last-meeting with me. I'lis notes for 17 November say that at
1210 Yrly (ISAYEV) came in with another "diplomat" and both

able to see Subject. ISAYEV then added Subject shouldn't forget
about what LOGI NOV had asked him: Subject answered that he didn't
not know what he did. He said he said he said he said he said he
"Good, he will come to see you). I asked Subject why ISAYEV
would be di- causing LOGI NOV's business-with him. Subject had no
idea, except that he thinks, because of this, that they are
connected professionals! (COMMENT: GRU and KGB?)

DATE :F MEETING:
10 November 1968
I picked Subject up on the corner of Nazas and Molchor
Ocamp) at 1100 on 10 November. The meeting was held in my
car a.d lasted an hour. Next meeting is for 21 November at 1100.
2. Subject started things out by saving that (LOIGNO) is
tryin. to recruit him to report on LIEMPTY-6, Revicw of his notes
and i discussion revealed the following: On 5 November LOGIONV
came n. Subject told him he had found a house on Junanacatian.
The meeting was held in my car a.d. was held in my car a.d.
si. f Talz, Tacubay: and for Subject to keep looking. Then
LOGO V said that he would like to rent an apartment at P.A.
and 10 November. The meeting was held in my car a.d. was held
LOIGNV said Subject must know these apartments will. Subject
admitted that he did and began to sketch them by LOGIONV
didn't seem to be interested in his efforts. LOGIONV then asked
that he did not have a good chance to pay for the Department
16. LOGIONV then said that since Subject knows the apartments
so well he must also know the people who live there. Subject
admitted that he did. At this point some other Soviets came in
the same way. He said that he did not have a good chance to
dropped by for some small talk' and left some Soviet chocolate
(which Subject showed no) for Subject's grandchild. On 9 November
LOGIONV came in at 1230 and asked Subject to go to a restaurant
and the other. He said that he did not have a good chance to stick
and he had no ope: to leave the store with. Subject then subjected
LOGIONV to his house but LOGIONV insisted on a restaurant.
Subject agreed to go on 12 or 13 November.
3. From the above Subject concludes that LOGIONV wants to
recruit him. The meeting was held in my car a.d. was held in my
Santos 104). I asked why LOGIONV would be interested in LIEMPTY-6
(there is nothing about him in the notes). Subject answered
that he finds LIEMPTY-6 very auspicious because in the 5 years
of the meeting, he said that he did not have a good chance to
living. He thinks he writes novels. In any case he is home
all day long. In addition he lies. Example: He told Subject
that he was not a subject. He said that he did not have a
 carefully his windows face on the Embassy. LIEMPTY-6 has apartment
17. The apartment directly below his, number 13, (probably old
LILYRIC) is empty. Subject went to see the owner having LOGIONV
and the other. He said that he did not have a good chance to
LIE MPTY-6 which Subject also finds surprising. The whole theme
was that he is suspicious of LIEMPTY-6 and that LOGIONV wants
to recruit him to report on him. All of the above on LIEMPTY-6
and his apartment was verbal. There was not a word about him
in his notes.
3. Subject said Subject that if LOGIONV tries to recruit him for
any purpose, he is to cut him short and to indignantly refuse.
He is also to toll LOGIONV that SLINKOV had tried the same thing
two months ago.

money. He is 28-30 years old, married and has worked for
Nicolas for 2 or 3 years. (COMMENT: Colonia Pensil As in the
western part of Tacuba and is full of Lagoe, but nothing
anywhere near Lago. Coni). I told Subject to go ahead and get
me the information on Hicolias LNU anyway. His notes on this
are in the entry for 28 October.
5. With this Subject ran out of volunteered information and
we attacked his notos which contained the following items
worthy of note :
1. Subject October L'OCIONVr idea in and asked Subject
to keep looking for a house care. the Embassy. He said they
want it for a school to which the children can walk since
driving them back and forth to the present school is proving
cumbersome. He also suggested that Subject sign the rental
contract since many people are unwilling to rent to Soviets.
When I expressed surprise about Subject signing a contract for
a woman who is a woman who is a woman who is a woman
Soviet Colonel in 1953 (the year Stalin died). This house was
at Chicontepso 70 and rented for 4,000 pesos. (COMMENT: That
Subject could sign a contract for 5,000 pesos a month. is
ridiculous: "that the Soviets are looking for a new school
just after moving into the new one is strange).

usual effervescent self, asked immediately if I had
gotten the capers he left for ne, stated that he had
decided to go to Moscow, rattled off his schedule, gave
ne the names of the only other two travel agents he
knew were going, repeated several times he'd be happy
to give me a report when ne returned, and asked, as if
he hoped I didn't, if there was anything I wanted to
tell him before he left. I got the floor about this
time and proceeded to backtrack over some of the ground
just covered. As for his schedule and itinerary, he
plans to leave for Moscow on 23 October via Air France,
stopping over briefly in Paris; to make a side trip to
Kiev on 27 and 28 October; and to leave Moscow for
Paris via Air France on 30 October. He will fly from
Paris to Genoa for a day on travel business and then
return to Mexico from Paris on Air France. via New York,
where he plens to pick up a couple of suits and take in
"Superman" on Broadway. He will arrive back in Mexico
on 3 Osteven's November.
3. Subject said that in addition to the other
three agents whom he had mentioned last time as having
been invited to the Intourist Conference-Moisers SCHUSTER
of Mundos Tours, Carlos IBARGUEN of De Carlo Tours, and
Edmundo GARZA of Garza Travel Service--he had learned that
Isaac BULAEVSKY of Jet Travel Agency had also received
an invitation. Besides himself, however, only SCHUSTER
ong field
and BULAEVSKY are going, the other two having decided
P- 8415
against the trip. for unknown reasons. Subject mentioned
that SCHUSTER is going to take his son, who is in his
early teens.
4. I asked Subject if he had been in touch with
anyone at the Soviet Embassy about the trip or if anyone
there seemed to be responsible for lining up pa ricipants
18 001666


for or to have any special interest in the Conference.
Subject replied that he had been at the Soviet Embassy
about the middle of September on visa business and had
seen the Soviet the always deals with on visa matters,
but that this individual seemed surprised to hear Subject
had been invited to Moscow and claimed to know nothing-
or at least none of the details--about the Intorquist
Conference. Subject claimed not to be able to remember
the Soviet's name, hunted around in his wallet unsuc-
cessfully for the Soviet's card, and then said, well,
in- any case it was the individual he had mentioned
last time as having just gotten a Promotion to Consul.

The C/o tried to cunter the self-cereinination of Subj by tolling him that
he had accomplished a superb job in the duel of the West with the Soviet threugh

dealing with them hed been masterful. Subj shook off the C/O's optimitio view of
Subj's contribution to the "cause."

(LOGINOV) came in for cigarettes. He maid that there are 52
Vacicans studying at Luminuba. These students are along to be
the directors in the schools of the Politechnico Nacional since
one of them has come back well prepared in physics. (Theke

Mexico another Cuba.

The "Spanish type" came in with a briefcase and bought Balcighs

A useless blurb about an unnumed Soviet who came in and discoursed
on MADRAZO, saying that he will set up a new party and an
anti-Soviet blast.
27 September (Tuesday)
(DENISOV) came in at 1210 and made a phone call. I board him
mention Delicia and del Rio. Since these towns are near the
border near San Diego, I think he was talking about smuggling
and the other. Afterwards I asked after his wife.
He said that she and their daughter are in Moscow and that he
is a bafchelor. I asked if he was able to find a girl. He
answered, of course, but they all want a house: He left at 1230.

DATE OF MEETING: 28 September 1966
1. LICOZY-5 reported on 20 September that LICANNY-1
of Garza-Lopez Tours was one of those invited to attend
the 24-29 Intourist Conference in Moscow. This was
confirmed by LIENVOY on the same date. Since the Station
had had no contact with Subject sine 6 January 1966, I
contacted Don Lautz of the Visa Section on 27 September
to see if Subject was still coming into the Embassy
regularly one on visa business. Lautz said that Subject
had for some time now been sending an agent to the
Embassy rather than coming himself. Lautz readily
agreed to give Subject a call, however, and reached him
late that afternoon. He told Subject that the "people"
at the Embassy whom he had introduced Subject to earlier
were interested in talking with him and asked if he could
drop into the Embassy in the next few days. Subject
immediately recognized which "people". Lautz was referring
to, said that as a matter of fact he had something to
discuss with "them, commented that it probably in fact
involved the same matter, and agreed to come to Lautz's
office at 11:00 the next day. As he had done with Irving
A. Oronsky, Lautz agreed to let me use his office to
talk to Subjects.
2. I went to Lautz's office at 11:00 on the 28th,
but when Subject had not appeared by 11:15, Lautz agreed
to call me in my office when Subject arrived. Lautz called
about 11:30, and I went right down. By the time I got
there, however, Subject had already explained to Lautz
that he was sure I wanted to talk about his invitation to

the USSR and had given Lautz a list of three other
invitans to the Tosturist conference. Lautz introduced
me by true name as Oronsky's replacement. Subject, in
what Lautz had forewarned me was his usuals over-enthusiatio
manner, greeted me with a "believe me, it is my pleasure"
salutation and, upon confirming that it was the Intourist
conference I was interest in, took off from there. Without
the slightest prompting, he rattled off the following:
a) He had received a telegram from Moscow on
6 September inviting his to an Intourist conference in
Moscow from 24-29 October. He had immediately thought
of informing the Embassy, but because of the pressure
of business simply hadn't gotten around to it. When
Lautz called him, he knew immediately what we were
interested in:
b). He had prepared a Xerox copy of the telegram
for us, which he gave to me. He has not yet definitely
made up his mind about attending the conference, but
thinks he probably will go. At the moment, he was still
awaiting the detailed letter on the conference which,
according to the telegram, was to follow. (LICOZI-5 has
already received his letter.) In reply to my question
as to whether he was sending enough people to the USSR
to make the trip really worthwhile, he said that he
had sent only five people there so far this year, but
that he thought travel to the Soviet Union was definitely
going to pick up. He said that LOGINOV, who has been
the Soviet official he has been dealing with about visas,

to Moscow could consequently be made at relatively little
additional expense.
c) Subject continued that if he did go to Moscow,
he would be glad to submit a report on his trip when he
got back, get (group) pictures, if we wanted them, of
his eyes open. However, he said, as he told Oronsky, he
is not interested in working for us on a permanent basis,
the us, or taking any money,
was willing to help, he explained, because he believed
basically what we did about current world problems and,
after all, had lived in the Stats for many years and
regarded it as his "second home." He said he liked the
arrangement of meeting in Lautz's office because it made
clandestine meetings unnecessary and because he had a
perfectly legitimate reason for being there.
d) Subject stated that he had already given Lautz
the names of the other travel agents in Mexico whom he
had heard had been invited to Moscow and said that once
he received the Intourist letter giving the details on
the conference he would begin calling around to see
exactly who was going.
3. Since a) Subject had already volunteered to do
primarily what I intended to ask him, b) had not yet
definitely decided to make the trip, c) Lautz gave no
indication of preparing to leave us alone, and d) I
clearly could not get any farther with Subject on a
personal level with Lautz present, I brought the meeting
to an end with a request to see Subject again after he
had received the Intourist letter, obtained the namea of
those of his colleagues who were going, and decided
definitely whether or not he was going to go. Subject
said he would be happy to talk with me again, get the
3

in
information I wanted, and, " if I liked," "be briefed"
on the trip. It was agreed he would call Lautz to set
up the meeting. (The situation was such that I do not
blame Lautz for apparently thinking it unnecessary to
leave in alone this time, but I made a special point
of requesting that he leave us to ourselves next time.
Lautz, who seems to be thoroughly friendly and accommodating,
readily agreed.)
4. Subject impresses me as a very sharp, shrewd,
cool-headed, but probably basically sincere individual.
No had the situation figured perfectly when he arrived
in Lautz's office, had decided precisely what he would
be willing to do, knew exactly what he was going to say,
and wasted no words in saying it. I plan to try to get
to know him a little better next time, give him a defensive
briefing as well as one on what to keep his eyes open
for, and also explore his attitude toward a possible
recruitment pitch from the Soviets. (Prior to his trip
to the USSR in May 1963, Subject agreed to accept Soviet
recruitment if approached and to serve as a D.A. Upon
his return, however, he reported that the Soviets made
no approach to him.) I also want to ask him about LOGINOV,
to
on whom he agreed to supply personality data
to
oponaty, but evidently never did. Subject mentioned
that LOGINOV had told him about ten days ago that he
had been promoted to Consul. Subject did not say if
he had been in touch with LOGINOV or anyone else at the
Soviet Embassy about the Intourist conference. I will
get this from him next time.
5. Subject told Lautz that the following individuals
had been invited to the Intourist conference:
(a) Noises Schuster of Nundos Tours.
(b) Carlos IBARGUEN of De Carlo Tours (IBARGUEN
is also the presicient of the Mexican Travel Agents' Assoc.)

(c) Someone from the Garza Travel Service.
Subject also gave me an Air France tourist pamphlet on
the USSR in Spanish for my information.
6. Subject mentioned in passing that he would be
glad to furnish us (presumably on a regular basis) with
the names of those people who book travel to the Soviet
Union through his Agency, but said Oronsky had previously
shown disinterest in such information. In view of Oronsky's
alleged disinterest, I let the subject pass without comment,
but I see no reason not, take up his offer. Besides furnishing
us with a few more names, it would give us a reason for
continuing contact with Subject.

PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE
1. This. is a new, experimental version of the Personality Assessment
Questionnaire (sometimes informally called the PRQ III) which has been in
use for several years. This new form is largely a checklist and thus requires
far less essay-type reporting than the previous form.
2. For a number of years, our operational psychologists have been de-
veloping a system for indirect assessment of larget personalities. The
system employs-in lieu of psychological tests and interviews-observations
and the results of the study. The study is based on the results of
used as if they were items in a psychological test, and like test items, are
weighted and analyzed to yield a personality profile. Working from the
profile, operational psychologists describe the target personality's basic
aptitudes, attitudes, motives and susceptibilities. The goal of the assess-
ment is to identify feasible means of influencing the target person.
3. Reliability is vastly increased when two or more observers complete
this questionnaire independently. All items need not be completed; in fact,
it is a rare case where contact is sufficient to complete it fully. You are
not aware of the fact that the individual's behavior is not a result of
items with a "G," instead of the customary check mark or "X." Thus, on
observer with very limited consist can be expected to enter more "G's"
than "X's."

9.03.01
A
hearty other with well-defined preterence. He can and
the
work. He is very well-aidly. It lends to his a little one, the cosse and
boorish side: It is rather easy to imagine him ealing huge sand-
wiches and drinking beer with the boys at the neighborhood ber
9.03.02
A heavy ester with limited preferences. He eeks and smokes
with/guito but his manners are definitely coarse and boorish.
It is neither easy to Imagine him becoming quite sharp with a
water. who serves him unfamiliar forod or a dish prepared in
an unfamiliar way.
9.03.03
A
sensul eater who knows all the restaurants and their native
specialties. He is very anxious to have others try dishes he
has discovered. He eeks with obvious pleasure, savor-his
smokes, and though rarely gauche, he is more.owere of his
food than his manners. It is easy to imagine him cooking and
serving special dishes to his friends.
-24-


9.03.04
A sensual eater who tends to eat by himself when possible.
He seems to eat all types of food and has something of the
air of a gluton about him. He eats with obvious pleasure,
sovors his smokes and aftervirds will linger alone at a table
with self-exification. It is easy to imagine him hovering
alone over the buffet at a cocktail party savoring the flidbits.
9.03.05
A conventional eater who usually goes along with the crowd.
He probably has food allergies that prevent him from eating
certain foods. He gives the impression of enjoying smoking
more than eating but his table manners are"adopted to what-
ever situation he is in. It is easy to imagine him taking an
indigestion pill in the privacy of his room.
9.03.06
A conventional eater who always goes along with the crowd.
He eats with little relish and rarely mentions anything about
his likes or dislikes. He smokes at every opportunity; but
more mechanically than with pleasure. He usually tries to
adapit his manners to the situation but may be a little awkward
and obvious in doing so. It is easy to imagine him grabbing a
bite at a sidewalk stand at any time of day.
9.03.07
A gourmet eater who has marked and varied sophisticated
food tosts. Dining is quite a ritual with him, and omo-
sphere and service are almost as important as the food. He
is graceful and cultured at table and smokes in the same
manner. It is easy to imagine him dressing for dinner, en-
joying fine wines and food by cundelight.
9.03.08
An unconventional eater, a man who "eats like a bird."
He eols in a preoccupied way, obviously indifferent to
his food and surroundings. It would not be surprising to
learn he was a food faddist (vegetarian, health foods,
etc.).

drunk or tight. Tends to tell people how much he likes them

impression that he could become quite disgusting if he got
very drunk.
-28-


9.05.05
A steody drinkeri who holds his liquor very well. He al-
ways remains quite dignified and usually maintains his poise
even though others are becoming quite drunk or right. He
still remains part of the crowd, however-that is, he gives
few signs of being disguised or bored.
9.05.06
A light drinker who poses his drinks. He seems to drink only
because it is socially necessary. As a perty progresses he
tends to become alcohol and distant. Is likely to continue to
talk about his work even when it is inappropriate.
9.05.07
A light drinker who taper off as the evening progresses.
Usually manges to keep a sophisticated aloofness from
others. Often singles out and associates with someone

ferous. Often becomes quite sarcastic about others'
behavior.
9.05.08
A very light drinker who either drinks only because he
has to or refuses to drink at all. Is usually not really
a part of the party and is obviously annoyed when others

controlled manner.

pied even in his walk. When he takes time to "fix things" he

sotion or otherwise preoccupied, he con sometimes be quite
a dangerous driver.
10.03.07

Overall impression of temperament and sense of humor:
(Check the most appropriate description.)
11.03.01
He is a hearty, hole fellow who laughs with gusto and pleasure,
His humor is forthright, not subtle, and although he is sometimes
loud, he is rarely unpleasant or objectionable. Most of the
time, his good humor is contagious.
11.03.02
He is a hearty fellow who, when he laughs, does so with conetimes
siderable gusto. However, he is frequently door and sometimes
intolerant and somewhat humorless. His humor is direct, even
crude, and at times, inappropriate. He tends to be the kind of
person who laughs more at people than with people.
-40-


14/20/00
11.03.03
He is a good-humored fellow who sometimes can be considered
jolly.and corefree. His humdri is clever and well timed. He is
quite.sensitive to the moods and feelings of others and often
can do a good job appropriately living up a porty. Although
something of a tease, he is never cruel or insensitive.
11.03.04
He is generally a rather quiet and somewhat complacent person
who, at times, can be surprisingly gay and corefree. However,
when gay, he sometimes overdoes if and causes some strain for
those around him. His humor is often clever but he can be
quite sorcastic and even biting on occasion.
11.03.05
He is an ubane fellow, generally quite conventional and appro-
priate. He does not necessarily appear to be a humorless person,
but he seldom displays his sense of humor. It is sometimes diffi-
ciently, but he is not a person who is not a person who is
he cayers or controls his feelings: His humor is more studied
than spontaneous yet it's never crude or inappropriate.
11.03.05
He is a dour.and humorless person; always serious and intense.
It is difficult to-joke around him-parly because he is not re-
sponsive and, partly because he seems to disapprove.
11.03.07
He is a sensitive, sophisticated fellow with a subtle wit. He
can bo quite charming and amusing in the right sort of setting.
However, there is something of an aristocratic quality to his
sense of humor and he can be quite condescending towards
people who do not understand or appreciate his sense of humor.
11.03.08
He is an arty, somewhat cynical person who can be quite
flippant of times. His humor tends to be a bit for out. He
seems to have private jokes he shares with intimates. It is
sometimes difficult to tell whether he is being amusing or
subly hostile:
11.03.09
None of these fit. I would describe him as:

self-confident with women, and most women seem to like it.
12.02.02
He is an eorthy, lusty man who on occasion con be crude or
even vulgur. He treats women rather harshly, and can become
quite pushy when attracted to a woman. He seems to be very
proud of his virility. Many women would be offended or re-
buffed by his aggressiveness, but this does not seem to bother
him.
-43-


14/20/00
3.
12.02.03
He is a somewhat sensual, rather soft man who is very consid-
erate of women. He is prone to hold a woman's hand overly
long when talking to her and frequently puts his arms around
women he admires. He often uses (lattery and compliments
but does so rather graciously. Most women usually like his
attentiveness.
12.02.04
He is a sexual person, but is embarrassed and insecure about
it. He is a rather soft man who tries hard to be inoffensive.
However, he will frequently follow attractive women with his
eyes when he thinks no one is looking. He is also prone to
brush against or touch women "accidentally" whenever he gets
a chance.
12.02.05
He is a self-confident, rather polished person who is proper
and conventional with either men or women. He is always
considerate and polite with all women and it is difficult to
ascertain what his sexual attitudes and interests might be.
In a group, he always behaves according to protocol and
usually can be quite efficient in doing so.
12.02.06
He is a self-confident and precise person who has something
of the air of a professional man about him. He is polite,
almost to a fault, and is inclined to go out of his way to
light a woman's cigarette or see that she is properly taken
care of. Nevertheless, he shows considerable distance in
his relations with women. Sometimes his formality is out
of place, but he will rarely, if ever, change his manners
or procedures to fit the situation.
12.02.07
He is a charming, urban person and both friendly and
sophisticated. He deals with women in a cultured way
but shows little sensuality or sexual inappropriateness.
He is neat, even dapper, and can be quite fastitious.
Most of his relations with women appear to be quite plas-
tanic. He is the kind of person who likely. has several
very close friends who are women:

22 Dec 1155-1245, Subj's office
1. The C/0 dropped by Subj's office on 22 Dec, after having delivered a
Christeme gift of liquor to Subj's home the previous day.
Subj was very appreciative of the gift.
2. Subj showed the C/0. the reservation card for travel of Soviet Georgi Vloko
and his family, Nina,rina and tarina. They're booked for a parture from Kuxico
for 25 Dec by Air France, for Paris. Juris to Brussels, where Vloko has four days
of business, and continuing flight Brussels to Koscoi on 30 December.
Vloko had. disputed Subj in company with another Subj who Subj was told was
Vloko's successful (from the latter) card) - Victor M. Bonone, ConsaJero Comorad
de Ja. Mora Jousbictos.
3. Subj stated that he had received a lotter from Sidney Neintrawb, O.S. State
Department official now in Chile, inutting Subj to visit him. (Commenta: Nintraub
and the 1956 report) was a member of the United States. The 1956 report
by the. Subjutes in Mexico, who had Subj try to maintain contact on his. Boahtington
tripa/. Please forward this information to Gerald F. Gastefter in Santiago.
4. Subj said he had received a firm imitation from Mr. Hawkins (phonetic), l'or,
of Air France in Mexico, to go on the inaugural flight of Air France to Red China,
possibly in April 1967. Subj was completely neutral about the going, but asked
the C/0 if we had any interest in hit taking the trip to Red China. The C/0 sold
we would let him know about that.
5: The C/0 asked Subj to have the 100% of the office closed, so that in mythic
discus- a serious matter. The C/0 said he united to explore frankly the path
of Subj's relationship toward Subj's products. The C/0 stated, bluntly that those
were not in the United States. The C/0 had not achieved a sufficient degree of
cut-off from the Subjots, and that his posture of friendly compromise weakened
his attance. In reply, Subj mentioned the two elements that went into his
attitude toward the Subjots.
6. Subj's report was associating with them, Subj said that had fallen
to such an inionightcant level that it had no effect in his dealings with the
Subjots. And he said that level would sink even more when the Subjots inaugurate
Aerofot flights from Montreal and New York the Subjots do not handle bookings
with the Subjots.
8. his personality (the C/0 had asked if it were possible for Subj to become cool
or even unfriendly toward the Subjots); Subj'ssial he could not change his
parorality. In the past year he had cooled off noticeably, having rasted all
cooperation with them, avoided them, put difficulties in the way of meetings, etc.
The Subj's report was a very good way to be the first time. The Subj's
be thrown into association. He cited proudly that he was not beholden to the
Subjots for anything, and never went out of his way to seek anything from them;
for instance, he had been told that Fueb Yatkow had brought back cairler for
Subj on his return from the Subjot Union - but Subj made no move to call Tatskow
(when and if Yatkow calls him, he will see him and cannot understand how he
could be unfriendly to Yatkow under auch circumstances).
9. The C/0 mentioned to Subj the Latters equivocal reply of "maybe" when
Toginow had asked if Subj would report the name of the CTA chief in Muxico if
he hasy's. Subj replied that he had told Logino that the Latter was crazy
